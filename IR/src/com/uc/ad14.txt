24011540	Comparison of frailty of primary neurons, embryonic, and aging mouse cortical layers.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130904 2014Feb
Superficial layers I to III of the human cerebral cortex are more vulnerable toward AÎ² peptides than deep layers V to VI in aging. Three models of layers were used to investigate this pattern of frailty. First, primary neurons from E14 and E17 embryonic murine cortices, corresponding respectively to future deep and superficial layers, were treated either with AÎ²(1-42), okadaic acid, or kainic acid. Second, whole E14 and E17 embryonic cortices, and third, in vitro separated deep and superficial layers of young and old C57BL/6J mice, were treated identically. We observed that E14 and E17 neurons in culture were prone to death after the AÎ² and particularly the kainic acid treatment. This was also the case for the superficial layers of the aged cortex, but not for the embryonic, the young cortex, and the deep layers of the aged cortex. Thus, the aged superficial layers appeared to be preferentially vulnerable against AÎ² and kainic acid. This pattern of vulnerability corresponds to enhanced accumulation of senile plaques in the superficial cortical layers with aging and Alzheimer's disease. 
24011542	Combination of memantine and vitamin D prevents axon degeneration induced by amyloid-beta and glutamate.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130904 2014Feb
The currently available drugs for treatment of Alzheimer's disease are symptomatic and only temporarily slow down the natural history of the disease process. Recently, its has been proposed that the combination of memantine with vitamin D, a neurosteroid hormone, may prevent amyloid-beta and glutamate neurotoxicity. Here, our purpose was to examine the potential protective effects of memantine and vitamin D against amyloid-beta peptide and glutamate toxicity in cortical neuronal cultures. We provide the first evidence that cortical axons degenerate less after exposure to amyloid-beta peptide or glutamate in microfluidic neuronal cultures enriched with memantine plus vitamin D compared to control medium and cultures enriched with only memantine or only vitamin D. The reported synergistic neuroprotective effect of memantine plus vitamin D -the combination originating an effect stronger than the sum- corroborate previous clinical finding that Alzheimer's disease patients using this drug combination have improved cognition. This finding reinforces the pharmacological potential of a new drug combining memantine plus vitamin D for the treatment or the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.  
24011543	Association of cerebrospinal fluid AÎ²42 with A2M gene in cognitively normal subjects.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130904 2014Feb
Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AÎ²(42) levels correlate with increased brain AÎ² deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which suggests a disruption in the degradation and clearance of AÎ² from the brain. In addition, APOE Îµ4 carriers have lower CSF AÎ²(42) levels than non-carriers. The hypothesis of this investigation was that CSF AÎ²(42) levels would correlate with regulatory region variation in genes that are biologically associated with degradation or clearance of AÎ² from the brain. CSF AÎ²(42) levels were tested for associations with AÎ² degradation and clearance genes and APOE Îµ4. Twenty-four SNPs located within the 5' and 3' regions of 12 genes were analyzed. The study sample consisted of 99 AD patients and 168 cognitively normal control subjects. CSF AÎ²(42) levels were associated with APOE Îµ4 status in controls but not in AD patients; A2M regulatory region SNPs were also associated with CSF AÎ²(42) levels in controls but not in AD patients, even after adjusting for APOE Îµ4. These results suggest that genetic variation within the A2M gene influences CSF AÎ²(42) levels. 
24011544	Familial Alzheimer's disease coding mutations reduce Presenilin-1 expression in a novel genomic locus reporter model.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130904 2014Feb
We have generated a physiologically relevant bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based genomic DNA expression model to study PS1 gene expression and function. The PS1-WT-BAC construct restored Î³-secretase function, whereas the mutant PS1 BACs demonstrated partial to complete loss of enzymatic activity when stably expressed in a PS double knock-out clonal cell line. We then engineered WT and mutant human PS1-BAC-Luciferase whole genomic locus reporter transgenes, which we transiently transduced in mouse and human non-neuronal and neuronal-like cells, respectively. PS1 Î”E9 and C410Y FAD were found to lower PS1 gene expression in both cell lines, whereas PS1-M146V showed a neuron-specific effect. The nonclinical Î³-secretase inactive PS1-D257A mutation did not alter gene expression in either cell line. This is the first time that pathogenic coding mutations in the PS1 gene have been shown to lower PS1 gene expression. These findings may represent a pathologic mechanism for PS1 FAD mutations independent of their effects on Î³-secretase activity and demonstrate how dominant PS1 mutations may exert their pathogenic effects by a loss-of-function mechanism.  
24018213	Missense variants in CR1 are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer' disease in Han Chinese.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130907 2014Feb
Complement receptor 1 (CR1) has been considered to play an important role in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) pathogenesis. To explore the correlation between the CR1 gene and LOAD, a 2-step design study was conducted in our Northern Han Chinese population. We first sequenced the promoter, exons, the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and exon-intron boundaries of CR1 in a small sample (n = 100). This allowed us to identify a total of 22 variants. In addition, 6 missense variants within the CR1 gene were selected to be genotyped in a total of 2292 individuals. Only 2 SNPs (rs116806486, Thrâ†’Ala; rs6691117, Ileâ†’Val) were significantly associated with an increased risk of LOAD. After stratiï¬?cation by APOE Îµ4-carrying status, significance was observed in APOE Îµ4 non-carriers for rs116806486 and in APOE Îµ4 carriers for rs6691117. Logistic analysis revealed that the rs116806486 polymorphism remained associated with LOAD in a dominant model, whereas the rs6691117 polymorphism was associated with LOAD in additive and recessive models but not in a dominant model after adjusting for sex, age at onset, and APOE Îµ4 status. Examination of the haplotypes identified the risk of a 3-SNP (rs2274567, rs3737002, and rs6691117) haplotype "ATG" in CR1 was associated with an increased risk for LOAD. These findings provide the evidence that missense variants in the CR1 gene may be involved in LOAD pathologic process in Han Chinese. 
24041969	Assessing the role of the TREM2 p.R47H variant as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130913 2014Feb
A non-synonymous genetic rare variant, rs75932628-T (p.R47H), in the TREM2 gene has recently been reported to be a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, rare recessive mutations have been associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We aimed to investigate the role of p.R47H variant in AD and FTD through a multi-center study comprising 3172 AD and 682 FTD patients and 2169 healthy controls from Spain. We found that 0.6% of AD patients carried this variant compared to 0.1% of controls (odds ratio [OR] = 4.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21-14.00, p = 0.014). A meta-analysis comprising 32,598 subjects from 4 previous studies demonstrated the large effect of the p.R47H variant in AD risk (OR = 4.11, 95% CI = 2.99-5.68, p = 5.27Ã—10(-18)). We did not find an association between p.R47H and age of onset of AD or family history of dementia. Finally, none of the FTD patients harbored this genetic variant. These data strongly support the important role of p.R47H in AD risk, and suggest that this rare genetic variant is not related to FTD. 
24041970	Evidence of altered phosphatidylcholine metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130913 2014Feb
Abberant lipid metabolism is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, but the connections between AD and lipid metabolic pathways are not fully understood. To investigate plasma lipids in AD, a multiplatform screen (n = 35 by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and n = 35 by nuclear magnetic resonance) was developed, which enabled the comprehensive analysis of plasma from 3 groups (individuals with AD, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and age-matched controls). This screen identified 3 phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecules that were significantly diminished in AD cases. In a subsequent validation study (n = 141), PC variation in a bigger sample set was investigated, and the same 3 PCs were found to be significantly lower in AD patients: PC 16:0/20:5 (p &lt; 0.001), 16:0/22:6 (p &lt; 0.05), and 18:0/22:6 (p &lt; 0.01). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of the PCs, combined with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) data, produced an area under the curve predictive value of 0.828. Confirmatory investigations into the background biochemistry indiciated no significant change in plasma levels of 3 additional PCs of similar structure, total choline containing compounds or total plasma omega fatty acids, adding to the evidence that specific PCs play a role in AD pathology. 
24054992	IPAF inflammasome is involved in interleukin-1Î² production from astrocytes, induced by palmitate; implications for Alzheimer's Disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130920 2014Feb
Inflammatory response has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms initiating the generation of inflammatory molecules in the central nervous system, such as interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²). Previously we identified that palmitate can induce primary astrocytes to produce cytokines, causing AD-like changes in primary neurons. Here we investigated and identified that palmitate induced the activation of ice protease-activating factor (IPAF)-apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD) (ASC) inflammasome in astrocytes leading to the maturation of IL-1Î², thereby implicating that not only pathogen-related factors can activate the IPAF-ASC inflammasome. Moreover, downregulating IPAF (which was found to be regulated by cAMP response element-binding protein) in astrocytes through silencing to decrease IL-1Î² secretion from the astrocytes reduced the generation of amyloid-Î²42 by primary neurons. Furthermore, the expression levels of IPAF and ASC were found significantly elevated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patients, suggesting an involvement of the IPAF-ASC inflammasome in the inflammatory response associated with AD, and thus could be a potential therapeutic target for AD.  
24064185	Alzheimer's disease susceptibility variants in the MS4A6A gene are associated with altered levels of MS4A6A expression in blood.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130921 2014Feb
An increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) has previously been found to be associated with variants at the MS4A6A locus. We sought to identify which genes and transcripts in this region have altered expression in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and are influenced by the AD risk variant(s), as a first step to understanding the molecular basis of AD susceptibility at this locus. Common variants located within highly expressed MS4A6A transcripts were significantly associated with AD and MS4A6A expression levels in blood from MCI and AD subjects (p &lt; 0.05, rs610932, rs7232, rs583791). More copies of the protective (minor) allele were associated with lower MS4A6A expression of each transcript (e.g., p = 0.019; rs610932-total MS4A6A). Furthermore, in heterozygous AD subjects, relative expression of the protective allele of V4-MS4A6A transcripts was lower (p &lt; 0.008). Irrespective of genotype, MS4A6A transcripts were increased in blood from people with AD (p &lt; 0.003), whereas lower expression of full length V1-MS4A6A (p = 0.002) and higher expression of V4-MS4A6A (p = 1.8 Ã— 10(-4)) were observed in MCI, relative to elderly controls. The association between genotype and expression was less consistent in brain, although BA9 did have a similar genotype association with V4-MS4A6A transcripts as in blood. MS4A6A transcripts were widely expressed in tissues and cells, with the exception of V4-MS4A6A, which was not expressed in neuronal cells. Together these results suggest that high levels of MS4A6A in emerging AD pathology are detrimental. Persons with MCI may lower MS4A6A expression to minimize detrimental disease associated MS4A6A activity. However, those with the susceptibility allele appear unable to decrease expression sufficiently, which may explain their increased risk for developing AD. Inhibiting MS4A6A may therefore promote a more neuroprotective phenotype, although further work is needed to establish whether this is the case. 
24064186	miR128 up-regulation correlates with impaired amyloid Î²(1-42) degradation in monocytes from patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130921 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in elderly individuals, is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and neuroinflammation. New evidence has shown that the lysosomal system might be a crossroad in which etiological factors in AD pathogenesis converge. This study shows that several lysosomal enzymes, including Cathepsin B, D, S, Î²-Galactosidase, Î±-Mannosidase, and Î²-Hexosaminidase, were less expressed in monocytes and lymphocytes from patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia compared with cells from healthy controls. In vitro experiments of gain and loss of function suggest that down-regulation is a direct consequence of miR-128 up-regulation found in AD-related cells. The present study also demonstrates that miR-128 inhibition in monocytes from AD patients improves AÎ²(1-42) degradation. These results could contribute to clarify the molecular mechanisms that affect the imbalanced AÎ² production/clearance involved in the pathogenesis of AD. 
24080173	A 2-process model for neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130927 2014Feb
This study examined relations among neuritic and diffuse plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, age, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in 2 large samples of neuropathology cases, the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project. Cognitive status ranged from normal to demented and AD neuropathology ranged from none to severe. Confirmatory factor analysis identified a best-fitting 4-factor solution to describe interrelationships among plaques and tangles: a global neuritic plaque factor; a global diffuse plaque factor; a factor defined by medial temporal neurofibrillary tangles; and a neocortical tangle factor. Results supported a hypothesis that neuritic plaques mediate the association of age and APOE with neocortical tangles, and similarly mediate the effect of APOE on medial temporal tangles. However, medial temporal tangles were related to age independent of neuritic plaques. These results support a primary amyloid-based AD process that accounts for neocortical tangles and makes the largest contribution to medial temporal tangles. A second, age-related but non-amyloid process likely contributes to medial temporal lobe tangles.  
24080176	No association of the LRRK2 genetic variants with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese individuals.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130927 2014Feb
The leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) gene has been regarded as 1 of the most common genetic causes of Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesized that LRRK2-susceptible allele(s) for PD might pose a risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we screened 12 LRRK2 gene variants in 2 independent cohorts from southwestern China (341 AD patients and 435 normal individuals) and eastern China (297 AD patients and 384 normal individuals), to discern the potential association between this gene and AD. No variant was identified to be associated with AD in either case-control sample. As both of the cohorts were of Han Chinese origin, we combined the LRRK2 variant data for the 2 sample sets together (a total of 638 AD patients and 819 normal individuals) and still found no association between the LRRK2 gene and AD, suggesting that LRRK2 gene variants may not affect the development of AD in Han Chinese individuals.  
24080178	Hippocampal and cortical atrophy in amyloid-negative mild cognitive impairments: comparison with amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130927 2014Feb
Although patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), their pathologies could be heterogeneous. We aimed to evaluate structural changes in amyloid-negative and amyloid-positive aMCI patients. Forty-eight aMCI patients who underwent Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography were recruited. They were classified as PiB (-) aMCI (N = 16) and PiB (+) (N = 32). Hippocampal shape and regional cortical thickness were compared with 41 subjects with normal cognition (NC). Relative to NC, PiB(-) aMCI exhibited hippocampal deformity in the right cornu ammonis 1, whereas PiB(+) aMCI exhibited hippocampal deformity in bilateral subiculum and cornu ammonis 1 subregions. Relative to NC, PiB(-) aMCI showed cortical thinning in the left medial prefrontal and right anterior temporal regions, whereas PiB(+) aMCI exhibited cortical thinning in bilateral medial temporal regions, temporoparietal junctions and precuneus, and prefrontal cortices. Our findings suggest that structural changes in PiB(-) aMCI might be due to several possible pathologic changes, whereas structural changes in PiB(+) aMCI reflect AD-like structural changes. 
23962667	The effect of exercise interventions on cognitive outcome in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.
Int Psychogeriatr 20130820 2014Jan
Non-pharmacological interventions may have a role in both the prevention and slowing down of disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role of exercise in disease prevention, for example, has been extensively evaluated in large epidemiological studies. Much less is known about the potential benefit of exercise in patients already diagnosed with AD. It was therefore the aim of this systematic review to assess the effectiveness of exercise in attenuating cognitive decline within AD. A systematic review was conducted statistically accompanied by a meta-analysis. Publications between January 1991 and October 2012 were identified by searching the electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, and PsychINFO. Selected studies required AD patients to take part in an exercise-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) and have a cognitive outcome measure. Six RCTs were identified that exclusively considered the effect of exercise in AD patients. Exercise generally had a positive effect on rate of cognitive decline in AD. A meta-analysis found that exercise interventions have a positive effect on global cognitive function, 0.75 (95% CI = 0.32-1.17). From the six studies reviewed, the evidence suggests that exercise can have a positive effect on rate of cognitive decline in AD. However, the variation between study designs makes conclusions regarding the optimum intervention on cognitive outcome in AD difficult. Well-designed and powered RCTs are still needed to ascertain the efficacy of exercise in slowing down cognitive impairment in AD patients. However, a positive initial indication for exercise efficacy justifies such efforts. 
24182362	Stressful life events are not associated with the development of dementia.
Int Psychogeriatr 20131104 2014Jan
The impact of stressful life events as a risk factor of dementia diseases is inconclusive. We sought to determine whether stressful negative life events are associated with incidental dementia in a population-based study with long-term follow-up. We also tested the hypothesis that the occurrence of positive life events could mitigate or overcome the possible adverse effects of negative life events on dementia conversion. The study involved 2,462 dementia-free participants aged 55 years and older. Information on life events was ascertained at baseline from a comprehensive Life Event Inventory, which included 56 questions about specific life events. For each life event, the emotional impact (both positive and negative) and emotional adjustment were asked for. During follow-up, 423 participants developed dementia; of these, 240 developed Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cox regression analysis showed no association between the total number of negative life events and the incidence of dementia when adjusted solely for age and gender (hazard ratio = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.92-1.02), or with multiple adjustments for a range of covariates (hazard ratio = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.91-1.01). Similarly, neither emotional impact nor emotional adjustment to these life events was associated with incident dementia. A separate analysis of AD did not alter the results. The result of this population-based study finds no association between negative or positive life events and dementia. Accordingly, our results reject the hypothesis that stressful life events trigger the onset of dementia diseases. 
24384363	Social positioning by people with Alzheimer's disease in a support group.
J Aging Stud 20131211 2014Jan
People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often negatively positioned by others, resulting in difficulties upholding a positive sense of self. This might cause them to withdraw socially and apparently 'lose their minds'. Conversely, the sense of self can be strengthened with the support from others. This study aimed to describe, in accordance with positioning theory, how people with moderate AD positioned themselves and each other in a support group for people with AD. We describe five first-order positions; the project manager, the storyteller, the moral agent, the person burdened with AD, and the coping person. In the interactions that followed among the support group participants, those positions were mainly affirmed. This enabled participants to construct strong and agentic personae, and to have the severity of their illness acknowledged. Despite their language impairment participants managed to position and reposition themselves and others by assistance of the trained facilitator.  
24771519	Within-patient correspondence of amyloid-Î² and intrinsic network connectivity in Alzheimer's disease.
Brain 20140426 2014Jul
There is striking overlap between the spatial distribution of amyloid-Î² pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease and the spatial distribution of high intrinsic functional connectivity in healthy persons. This overlap suggests a mechanistic link between amyloid-Î² and intrinsic connectivity, and indeed there is evidence in patients for the detrimental effects of amyloid-Î² plaque accumulation on intrinsic connectivity in areas of high connectivity in heteromodal hubs, and particularly in the default mode network. However, the observed spatial extent of amyloid-Î² exceeds these tightly circumscribed areas, suggesting that previous studies may have underestimated the negative impact of amyloid-Î² on intrinsic connectivity. We hypothesized that the known positive baseline correlation between patterns of amyloid-Î² and intrinsic connectivity may mask the larger extent of the negative effects of amyloid-Î² on connectivity. Crucially, a test of this hypothesis requires the within-patient comparison of intrinsic connectivity and amyloid-Î² distributions. Here we compared spatial patterns of amyloid-Î²-plaques (measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography) and intrinsic functional connectivity (measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging) in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease via spatial correlations in intrinsic networks covering fronto-parietal heteromodal cortices. At the global network level, we found that amyloid-Î² and intrinsic connectivity patterns were positively correlated in the default mode and several fronto-parietal attention networks, confirming that amyloid-Î² aggregates in areas of high intrinsic connectivity on a within-network basis. Further, we saw an internetwork gradient of the magnitude of correlation that depended on network plaque-load. After accounting for this globally positive correlation, local amyloid-Î²-plaque concentration in regions of high connectivity co-varied negatively with intrinsic connectivity, indicating that amyloid-Î² pathology adversely reduces connectivity anywhere in an affected network as a function of local amyloid-Î²-plaque concentration. The local negative association between amyloid-Î² and intrinsic connectivity was much more pronounced than conventional group comparisons of intrinsic connectivity would suggest. Our findings indicate that the negative impact of amyloid-Î² on intrinsic connectivity in heteromodal networks is underestimated by conventional analyses. Moreover, our results provide first within-patient evidence for correspondent patterns of amyloid-Î² and intrinsic connectivity, with the distribution of amyloid-Î² pathology following functional connectivity gradients within and across intrinsic networks.  
24860142	Convergence of pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease: a role for the novel interaction of alpha-synuclein and presenilin 1 in disease.
Brain 20140524 2014Jul
A growing number of PSEN1 mutations have been associated with dementia with Lewy bodies and familial Alzheimer's disease with concomitant Î±-synuclein pathology. The objective of this study was to determine if PSEN1 plays a direct role in the development of Î±-synuclein pathology in these diseases. Using mass spectrometry, immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence lifetime image microscopy based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) we identified Î±-synuclein as a novel interactor of PSEN1 in wild-type mouse brain tissue. The interaction of Î±-synuclein with PSEN1 was detected in post-mortem brain tissue from cognitively normal cases and was significantly increased in tissue from cases with dementia with Lewy bodies and familial Alzheimer's disease associated with known PSEN1 mutations. We confirmed an increased interaction of PSEN1 and Î±-synuclein in cell lines expressing well characterized familial Alzheimer's disease PSEN1 mutations, L166P and delta exon 9, and demonstrated that PSEN1 mutations associate with increased membrane association and accumulation of Î±-synuclein. Our data provides evidence of a molecular interaction of PSEN1 and Î±-synuclein that may explain the clinical and pathophysiological overlap seen in synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and some forms of Alzheimer's disease.  
24644038	Homocysteine exacerbates Î²-amyloid pathology, tau pathology, and cognitive deficit in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease with plaques and tangles.
Ann. Neurol. 20140528 2014Jun
High level of homocysteine (Hcy) is a recognized risk factor for developing Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. Previously, it was shown that high Hcy increases brain Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) levels in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, but no data are available on the effect that it may have on the other main pathologic features of AD such as tau. 3xTg mice with diet-induced high Hcy were compared with mice having normal Hcy. Neuronal cells were incubated with and without Hcy. Diet-induced high Hcy resulted in an exacerbation of the entire AD-like phenotype of the 3xTg mice. In particular, we found that compared with controls, mice with high Hcy developed significant memory and learning deficits, and had elevated AÎ² levels and deposition, which was mediated by an activation of the Î³-secretase pathway. In addition, the same mice had a significant increase in the insoluble fraction of tau and its phosphorylation at specific epitopes, which was mediated by the cdk5 pathway. In vitro studies confirmed these observations and provided evidence that the effects of Hcy on AÎ² and tau are independent from each other. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that a dietary condition that leads to an elevation of Hcy levels results in an exacerbation of all 3 major pathological features of the AD phenotype: memory deficits, and AÎ² and tau neuropathology. They support the concept that this dietary lifestyle can act as a risk factor and actively contribute to the development of the disease. 
24907234	Vascular risk and AÎ² interact to reduce cortical thickness in AD vulnerable brain regions.
Neurology 20140606 2014Jul1
The objective of this study was to define whether vascular risk factors interact with Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) in producing changes in brain structure that could underlie the increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). Sixty-six cognitively normal and mildly impaired older individuals with a wide range of vascular risk factors were included in this study. The presence of AÎ² was assessed using [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B-PET imaging, and cortical thickness was measured using 3-tesla MRI. Vascular risk was measured with the Framingham Coronary Risk Profile Index. Individuals with high levels of vascular risk factors have thinner frontotemporal cortex independent of AÎ². These frontotemporal regions are also affected in individuals with AÎ² deposition, but the latter show additional thinning in parietal cortices. AÎ² and vascular risk were found to interact in posterior (especially in parietal) brain regions, where AÎ² has its greatest effect. In this way, the negative effect of AÎ² in posterior regions is increased by the presence of vascular risk. AÎ² and vascular risk interact to enhance cortical thinning in posterior brain regions that are particularly vulnerable to AD. These findings give insight concerning the mechanisms whereby vascular risk increases the likelihood of developing AD and supports the therapeutic intervention of controlling vascular risk for the prevention of AD. 
24816373	The Alzheimer's prevention initiative composite cognitive test score: sample size estimates for the evaluation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease treatments in presenilin 1 E280A mutation carriers.
J Clin Psychiatry  2014Jun
To identify a cognitive composite that is sensitive to tracking preclinical Alzheimer's disease decline to be used as a primary end point in treatment trials. We capitalized on longitudinal data collected from 1995 to 2010 from cognitively unimpaired presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers from the world's largest known early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease kindred to identify a composite cognitive test with the greatest statistical power to track preclinical Alzheimer's disease decline and estimate the number of carriers age 30 years and older needed to detect a treatment effect in the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative's (API) preclinical Alzheimer's disease treatment trial. The mean-to-standard-deviation ratios (MSDRs) of change over time were calculated in a search for the optimal combination of 1 to 7 cognitive tests/subtests drawn from the neuropsychological test battery in cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers during a 2- and 5-year follow-up period (n = 78 and 57), using data from noncarriers (n = 31 and 56) during the same time period to correct for aging and practice effects. Combinations that performed well were then evaluated for robustness across follow-up years, occurrence of selected items within top-performing combinations, and representation of relevant cognitive domains. The optimal test combination included Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word List Recall, CERAD Boston Naming Test (high frequency items), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Orientation to Time, CERAD Constructional Praxis, and Raven's Progressive Matrices (Set A), with an MSDR of 1.62. This composite is more sensitive than using either the CERAD Word List Recall (MSDR = 0.38) or the entire CERAD-Col battery (MSDR = 0.76). A sample size of 75 cognitively normal PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers aged 30 years and older per treatment arm allows for a detectable treatment effect of 29% in a 60-month trial (80% power, P = .05). We have identified a composite cognitive test score representing multiple cognitive domains that, compared to the most sensitive single test item, has improved power to track preclinical Alzheimer's disease decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers and to evaluate preclinical Alzheimer's disease treatments. This API composite cognitive test score will be used as the primary end point in the first API trial in cognitively unimpaired autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease carriers within 15 years of their estimated age at clinical onset. We have independently confirmed our findings in a separate cohort of cognitively healthy older adults who progressed to the clinical stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, described in a separate report, and continue to refine the composite in independent cohorts and compared with other analytic approaches. 
24421286	New criteria for frontotemporal dementia syndromes: clinical and pathological diagnostic implications.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. 20140113 2014Aug
To assess the impact of new clinical diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes, including primary progressive aphasias (PPA), on prior clinical diagnosis and to explore clinicopathological correlations. 178 consecutive neuropathologically ascertained cases initially diagnosed with a FTD syndrome were collected through specialist programmes: the Cambridge Brain Bank, UK, and Sydney Brain Bank, Australia. 135 cases were reclassified using the revised diagnostic criteria into behavioural variant (bvFTD), semantic variant PPA (sv-PPA), non-fluent/agrammatic variant PPA (nfv-PPA) and logopenic variant PPA (lv-PPA). Pathological diagnoses included FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, FTLD-UPS, FLTD-ni and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statistical analyses included Ï‡(2) tests, analyses of variance and discriminant statistics. Comparison of the original and revised diagnosis revealed no change in 90% of bvFTD and sv-PPA cases. By contrast, 51% of nfv-PPA cases were reclassified as lv-PPA, with apraxia of speech and sentence repetition assisting in differentiation. Previous patterns of pathology were confirmed, although more AD cases occurred in FTD syndromes (10% bvFTD, âˆ¼15% sv-PPA and âˆ¼30% nfv-PPA) than expected. AD was the dominant pathology (77%) of lv-PPA. Discriminant analyses revealed that object agnosia, phonological errors and neuropsychiatric features differentiated AD from FTLD. This study provides pathological validation that the new criteria assist with separating PPA cases with AD pathology into the new lv-PPA syndrome and found that a number of diagnostic clinical features (disinhibition, food preferences and naming) did not assist in discriminating the different FTD syndromes. 
24421287	Structural brain changes associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. 20140113 2014Aug
To examine neuroanatomical changes associated with depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the relationship between brain structure and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in depressed and non-depressed patients. Two independent cohorts were used in this study. The first cohort (KI) was collected from the Memory Clinic at Karolinska University Hospital and consisted of 41 AD patients. The second cohort was selected and downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI) and consisted of 148 patient. Patients underwent medical, neuropsychological assessment, laboratory analyses of CSF, including Î² amyloid 1-42 (AÎ² 42), total Ï„ (t-Ï„), phosphorylated Ï„ 181 (p-Ï„) and brain MRI examination. In the KI cohort, depression was assessed using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, and in the ADNI cohort the Geriatric Depression Scale was applied. 3D T1-weighted MRI images were processed using automated steps for segmentation and surface reconstruction implemented in Freesurfer. General linear model analysis was used as a statistical approach. Cortical thinning in AD patients with depressive symptoms compared with those without was observed in the left parietal and temporal brain regions in both cohorts. Negative correlation between cortical thickness and t-Ï„ was greater in depressed compared with non-depressed AD patients in precuneus and parahippocampal cortex. Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms in AD patients are associated with cortical thinning in temporal and parietal regions. In addition, our findings suggest that Ï„ protein pathology in these areas may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms in AD. 
24928124	Symptom onset in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Neurology 20140613 2014Jul15
To identify factors influencing age at symptom onset and disease course in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD), and develop evidence-based criteria for predicting symptom onset in ADAD. We have collected individual-level data on ages at symptom onset and death from 387 ADAD pedigrees, compiled from 137 peer-reviewed publications, the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) database, and 2 large kindreds of Colombian (PSEN1 E280A) and Volga German (PSEN2 N141I) ancestry. Our combined dataset includes 3,275 individuals, of whom 1,307 were affected by ADAD with known age at symptom onset. We assessed the relative contributions of several factors in influencing age at onset, including parental age at onset, age at onset by mutation type and family, and APOE genotype and sex. We additionally performed survival analysis using data on symptom onset collected from 183 ADAD mutation carriers followed longitudinally in the DIAN Study. We report summary statistics on age at onset and disease course for 174 ADAD mutations, and discover strong and highly significant (p &lt; 10(-16), r2 &gt; 0.38) correlations between individual age at symptom onset and predicted values based on parental age at onset and mean ages at onset by mutation type and family, which persist after controlling for APOE genotype and sex. Significant proportions of the observed variance in age at symptom onset in ADAD can be explained by family history and mutation type, providing empirical support for use of these data to estimate onset in clinical research. 
24992828	How proteomic ApoE serotyping could impact Alzheimer's disease risk assessment: genetic testing by proteomics.
Expert Rev Proteomics 20140704 2014Aug
Humans have three major apolipoprotein E (ApoE) alleles (APOE; Îµ2, Îµ3 and Îµ4) that produce three ApoE protein isoforms. The Îµ2 allele encodes the ApoE2 isoform (Cys112, Cys158), whereas Îµ3 encodes the wild-type ApoE3 isoform (Cys112, Arg158) and Îµ4 encodes the ApoE4 isoform (Arg112, Arg158). Because the type of ApoE expressed is related to sporadic Alzheimer's disease risk and familial hyperlipidemia, many clinical studies have utilized ApoE typing in recent years. ApoE serotyping is based on the correlation between ApoE genotype and isoform; it is therefore possible to determine the genotype from the blood ApoE isoform combination. Serotyping ApoE using mass spectrometry promises highly accurate results while requiring minimal amounts of blood and reagents, resulting in lower costs, which suggest that proteomic-based ApoE serotyping may eventually become a routine clinical laboratory test. Not limited to ApoE, proteomic analysis of human samples could be used to intentionally determine - and perhaps unintentionally reveal - personal genetic information.  
25005532	Tracking neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: the role of positron emission tomography imaging.
J Neuroinflammation 20140708 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reconceptualized as a dynamic pathophysiological process, where the accumulation of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) is thought to trigger a cascade of neurodegenerative events resulting in cognitive impairment and, eventually, dementia. In addition to AÎ² pathology, various lines of research have implicated neuroinflammation as an important participant in AD pathophysiology. Currently, neuroinflammation can be measured in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) with ligands targeting diverse biological processes such as microglial activation, reactive astrocytes and phospholipase A2 activity. In terms of therapeutic strategies, despite a strong rationale and epidemiological studies suggesting that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce the prevalence of AD, clinical trials conducted to date have proven inconclusive. In this respect, it has been hypothesized that NSAIDs may only prove protective if administered early on in the disease course, prior to the accumulation of significant AD pathology. In order to test various hypotheses pertaining to the exact role of neuroinflammation in AD, studies in asymptomatic carriers of mutations deterministic for early-onset familial AD may prove of use. In this respect, PET ligands for neuroinflammation may act as surrogate markers of disease progression, allowing for the development of more integrative models of AD, as well as for the measuring of target engagement in the context of clinical trials using NSAIDs. In this review, we address the biological basis of neuroinflammatory changes in AD, underscore therapeutic strategies using anti-inflammatory compounds, and shed light on the possibility of tracking neuroinflammation in vivo using PET imaging ligands.  
24982139	Serial propagation of distinct strains of AÎ² prions from Alzheimer's disease patients.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 20140630 2014Jul15
An increasing number of studies argues that self-propagating protein conformations (i.e., prions) feature in the pathogenesis of several common neurodegenerative diseases. Mounting evidence contends that aggregates of the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide become self-propagating in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. An important characteristic of prions is their ability to replicate distinct strains, the biological information for which is enciphered within different conformations of protein aggregates. To investigate whether distinct strains of AÎ² prions can be discerned in AD patients, we performed transmission studies in susceptible transgenic mice using brain homogenates from sporadic or heritable (Arctic and Swedish) AD cases. Mice inoculated with the Arctic AD sample exhibited a pathology that could be distinguished from mice inoculated with the Swedish or sporadic AD samples, which was judged by differential accumulation of AÎ² isoforms and the morphology of cerebrovascular AÎ² deposition. Unlike Swedish AD- or sporadic AD-inoculated animals, Arctic AD-inoculated mice, like Arctic AD patients, displayed a prominent AÎ²38-containing cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The divergent transmission behavior of the Arctic AD sample compared with the Swedish and sporadic AD samples was maintained during second passage in mice, showing that AÎ² strains are serially transmissible. We conclude that at least two distinct strains of AÎ² prions can be discerned in the brains of AD patients and that strain fidelity was preserved on serial passage in mice. Our results provide a potential explanation for the clinical and pathological heterogeneity observed in AD patients.  
25065098	Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional descriptive study in Thailand.
J Med Assoc Thai  2014May
To estimate the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Thai patients with Alzheimer's disease. The present study is a cross-sectional descriptive design. The participants comprised 62 patients from the Memory Clinic at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand. Subjects were diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria and received global Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) score of at least stage 1. All participants were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI) and the Thai Mental State Examination (TMSE). The subjects were female 62.9% and male 37.1%, the mean age was 76 +/- 6.7 years. The majority of them (62.9%) were in the mild stage (CDR = 1). The result showed that the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (&gt; or = 1 symptom) reported was 100%. The most common symptoms were apathy (71%), aberrant motor behavior (61.3%), sleep problems (56.5%), eating problems (51.6%) and agitation/aggression (45.2%), whereas the least was euphoria (6.5%). The number of neuropsychiatric symptoms increased with severity of the disease. The result also showed that 61.3% of the participants presented with the chief complaint of neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas memory complaints were only 38.7%. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are very common in Thai Alzheimer's disease patients. Therefore, management of Alzheimer's patients should include an assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms and also concentrate on reducing these symptoms. The number of neuropsychiatric symptoms increases with disease progression. Moreover, neuropsychiatric symptoms were the most common presenting problem rather than memory problem in Thai patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
25148802	Association between Cytokine Production and Disease Severity in Alzheimer's Disease.
Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol  2014Dec
The role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1, interferon (IFN)-Î³, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has long been reported in literature. In this case-control study, the concentrations of these cytokines in altered T lymphocytes, as well as serum vitamin B12, have been compared in terms of factors such as, age, the clinical course and the patients' disease risk. 40 patients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria of AD were selected and an age- and gender-matched control group was recruited. The participants' cognitive performance was measured according to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Clinical Dementia Ratio (CDR). The levels of cytokines were measured in supernatants of lymphocytes culture, using assays of ELISA and atomic absorption. Higher levels of IL-6 and IFN-Î³ were found more in the altered T lymphocytes of the AD patients rather than in the control individuals. Furthermore, a marginal significant difference was found between the TGF-Î² levels of the two study groups. Regression analysis of CDR score and cytokines showed the inverse significant correlation between CDR score and IFN-Î³ levels. Furthermore, the relation between MMSE scores and IFN-Î³ was significant, meaning that by increasing MMSE score, IFN-Î³ level was significantly increased. This study suggests that the levels of IL-6 and IFN-Î³ are significantly increased in altered T lymphocytes of AD patients, as compared to those who are not inflicted with AD, and that they are related to the patient's age. Also, IFN-Î³ is related to the severity stage of the AD.  
25148207	Genome-Wide Analysis of miRNA Signature in the APPswe/PS1Î”E9 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
PLoS ONE 20140822 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. One of the pathological hallmarks of AD is amyloid Î² (AÎ²) deposition. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs whose expression levels change significantly during neuronal pathogenesis and may be used as diagnostic markers. Some miRNAs are important in AD development by targeting genes responsible for AÎ² metabolism. However, a systematic assessment of the miRNA expression profile induced by AÎ²-mediated neuronal pathogenesis is still lacking. In the present study, we examined miRNA expression profile by using the APPswe/PS1Î”E9 mouse model of AD. Two sibling pairs of mice were examined, showing 30 and 24 miRNAs with significantly altered expression levels from each paired control, respectively. Nine known miRNAs were common in both groups. Prediction of putative target genes and functional annotation implied that these altered miRNAs affect many target genes mainly involved in PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This study provides a general profile of miRNAs regulated by AÎ²-associated signal pathways, which is helpful to understand the mechanism of AÎ²-induced neuronal dysfunction in AD development.  
25149218	Mitochondrial dysfunction: cause and consequence of Alzheimer's disease.
Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci  2014
The etiology of common, nonfamiliar late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is only partly understood and seems to be extremely complex including many genetic and environmental factors. The most important environmental risk factor to develop LOAD is aging itself. Aging and LOAD are considered to be strongly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced oxidative stress. In this review, we focus on the interaction between mitochondrial dysfunction in aging especially on defects of the respiratory chain of the oxidative phosphorylation system resulting in enhanced oxidative stress and the interplay between aging-associated mitochondrial defects and LOAD-associated mitochondrial failure. The deleterious effects of the two hallmarks of LOAD, amyloid beta, and hyperphosphorylated tau, on mitochondrial function, movement, and morphology are described as well as the toxic effects of the most relevant genetic risk factor of LOAD, the apolipoprotein E4 allele. Finally, the review provides an overview about drugs and nutritional ingredients which improve mitochondrial function or/and act as antioxidants and discusses their potential role in the treatment of LOAD.  
24852089	[Bioethical reflections on ill-considered care due to an early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease].
Gac Sanit 20140519 2014 Sep-Oct
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease raises important bioethical issues. In the interval between early disease detection and symptom onset, there is a time in which the patient's autonomy, privacy, and dignity may be undermined by certain healthcare measures or by family care and support. These measures may eventually turn patients into an object of care, preventing them from accepting the disease, developing an identity, and rearranging their living spaces. Every effort should be made to ensure that care does not become compassionate harassment or an invasive act, annulling the patient's autonomy, identity, and self-determination.  
24889701	[The cost of applying the dependency law to Alzheimer disease].
Gac Sanit 20140602 2014 Sep-Oct
To calculate the formal cost of social care for people with Alzheimer disease according to the implementation of the dependency law in Gipuzkoa (Spain). A retrospective observational study was carried out of the database of the Dependency Care Services of Gipuzkoa from 2007 to 2012, using a prevalence-based bottom-up approach. The average annual formal cost per person was â‚¬11,730. The annual population cost was â‚¬34.7 million, representing 19% of the annual expenditure corresponding to the dependency law and 29% of the total cost of Alzheimer disease. Despite the implementation of the new law, most of the burden of the disease is bourne by the family. 
25047996	Hyperplasticity in Autism Spectrum Disorder confers protection from Alzheimer's disease.
Med. Hypotheses 20140617 2014Sep
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) currently affects approximately 1% of the population causing grave disability and necessitating a better understanding of the currently enigmatic etiology of these disorders. Recent data suggest that some patients with ASD may have a dysfunction in brain plasticity (specifically data from animal models and human studies suggest a propensity toward excessive amount of plasticity). Plasticity is essential to the establishment and maintenance of brain circuitry; however, too much plasticity may lead to instability of structural connections and compromise of functional systems necessary for cognition and behavior. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that plasticity declines throughout the age-span and may underlie age-related cognitive decline. We hypothesize that individuals whose cortex begins as relatively "hyperplastic" (such as may be seen in ASD) should then be relatively protected from age-related cognitive decline (which we suggest is related to a reduction in plasticity). In the current study, we conducted a multiple linear regression using age and diagnosis as predictor variables in order to evaluate strength of the relationship between age, diagnosis or an interaction of the two factors and the degree of modulation in cortical excitability by transcranial magnetic stimulation as an index of cortical plasticity. Results indicate that across the age-span individuals with ASD show a consistently increased modulation of cortical excitability as compared to typically developing individuals, such that the general slope of decline across the age span is matched across both groups. We have argued that an individual's risk of age-related cognitive decline (and risk for manifesting symptoms of dementia) depends on the individual's starting point and slopes of change in plasticity efficiency over the lifespan. Therefore, our results suggest that individuals with ASD might be relatively protected from age-related cognitive decline and the risk of dementia.  
25150875	Pharmacogenomics of Alzheimer's disease: novel therapeutic strategies for drug development.
Methods Mol. Biol.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major problem of health and disability, with a relevant economic impact on our society. Despite important advances in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, its primary causes still remain elusive, accurate biomarkers are not well characterized, and the available pharmacological treatments are not cost-effective. As a complex disorder, AD is a polygenic and multifactorial clinical entity in which hundreds of defective genes distributed across the human genome may contribute to its pathogenesis. Diverse environmental factors, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and epigenetic phenomena, together with structural and functional genomic dysfunctions, lead to amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and premature neuronal death, the major neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Future perspectives for the global management of AD predict that genomics and proteomics may help in the search for reliable biomarkers. In practical terms, the therapeutic response to conventional drugs (cholinesterase inhibitors, multifactorial strategies) is genotype-specific. Genomic factors potentially involved in AD pharmacogenomics include at least five categories of gene clusters: (1) genes associated with disease pathogenesis; (2) genes associated with the mechanism of action of drugs; (3) genes associated with drug metabolism (phase I and II reactions); (4) genes associated with drug transporters; and (5) pleiotropic genes involved in multifaceted cascades and metabolic reactions. The implementation of pharmacogenomic strategies will contribute to optimize drug development and therapeutics in AD and related disorders.  
24819066	Cognitive correlates of metamemory in Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychology 20140512 2014Sep
Metamemory, or knowledge of one's memory abilities, is often impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the basis of this metacognitive deficit has not been fully articulated. Behavioral and imaging studies have produced conflicting evidence regarding the extent to which specific cognitive domains (i.e., executive function; memory) and brain regions contribute to memory awareness. The primary aim of this study was to disentangle the cognitive correlates of metamemory in AD by examining the relatedness of objective metamemory performance to cognitive tasks grouped by domain (executive function or memory) as well as by preferential hemispheric reliance defined by task modality (verbal or nonverbal). Eighty-nine participants with mild AD recruited at Columbia University Medical Center and the University of Pennsylvania underwent objective metamemory and cognitive testing. Partial correlations were used to assess the relationship between metamemory and four cognitive variables, adjusted for recruitment site. The significant correlates of metamemory included nonverbal fluency (r = .27, p = .02) and nonverbal memory (r = .24, p = .04). Our findings suggest that objectively measured metamemory in a large sample of individuals with mild AD is selectively related to a set of interdomain nonverbal tasks. The association between metamemory and the nonverbal tasks may implicate a shared reliance on a right-sided cognitive network that spans frontal and temporal regions.

25152281	[Diagnostic value of AD7C-NTP for patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease].
Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi  2014Jun3
To explore the diagnostic value of Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7C-NTP) in the assessment of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease. All subjects were recruited from neurology ward and clinic of our hospital from December 2012 to September 2013. Using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and urinary levels of AD7C-NTP were tested for 88 elders, including 52 patients with MCI and 36 healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 18.0. The CSF, serum and urinary levels of AD7C-NTP of two groups were (637 Â± 191) and (372 Â± 98); (499 Â± 139) and (271 Â± 105) and (343 Â± 99) and (195 Â± 76) ng/L respectively. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the optimal CSF cut-off point of AD7C-NTP for the diagnosis of MCI was 436.97 ng/L with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 85.0%; the optimal serum cut-off point of AD7C-NTP for the diagnosis of MCI was 367.06 ng/L with a sensitivity of 76.7% and a specificity of 85.0%; the optimal cut-off point of AD7C-NTP in urine for the diagnosis of MCI was 268.57 ng/L with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 90.0%. Compared with the normal healthy control group, the MCI group has significantly elevated CSF, serum and urine levels of AD7C-NTP. The CSF and urinary levels of AD7C-NTP have high sensitivity and specificity with similar results. And AD7C-NTP may aid the diagnosis of MCI. 
25025046	Chronic neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: new perspectives on animal models and promising candidate drugs.
Biomed Res Int 20140616 2014
Chronic neuroinflammation is now considered one of the major factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the most widely used transgenic AD models (overexpressing mutated forms of amyloid precursor protein, presenilin, and/or tau) do not demonstrate the degree of inflammation, neurodegeneration (particularly of the cholinergic system), and cognitive decline that is comparable with the human disease. Hence a more suitable animal model is needed to more closely mimic the resulting cognitive decline and memory loss in humans in order to investigate the effects of neuroinflammation on neurodegeneration. One of these models is the glial fibrillary acidic protein-interleukin 6 (GFAP-IL6) mouse, in which chronic neuroinflammation triggered constitutive expression of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in astrocytes. These transgenic mice show substantial and progressive neurodegeneration as well as a decline in motor skills and cognitive function, starting from 6 months of age. This animal model could serve as an excellent tool for drug discovery and validation in vivo. In this review, we have also selected three potential anti-inflammatory drugs, curcumin, apigenin, and tenilsetam, as candidate drugs, which could be tested in this model.  
24859566	Increased O-GlcNAc levels correlate with decreased O-GlcNAcase levels in Alzheimer disease brain.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20140523 2014Sep
The potential role of the posttranslational modification of proteins with O-linked N-acetyl-Î²-d-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been studied extensively, yet the exact function of O-GlcNAc in AD remains elusive. O-GlcNAc cycling is facilitated by only two highly conserved enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes the addition, while O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of GlcNAc from proteins. Studies analyzing global O-GlcNAc levels in AD brain have produced inconsistent results and the reasons for altered O-GlcNAcylation in AD are still poorly understood. In this study, we show a 1.2-fold increase in cytosolic protein O-GlcNAc modification in AD brain when compared to age-matched controls. Interestingly, O-GlcNAc changes seem to be attributable to differential modification of a few individual proteins. While our finding of augmented O-GlcNAcylation concurs with some reports, it is contrary to others demonstrating decreased O-GlcNAc levels in AD brain. These conflicting results emphasize the need for further studies providing conclusive evidence on the subject of O-GlcNAcylation in AD. We further demonstrate that, while OGT protein levels are unaffected in AD, OGA protein levels are significantly decreased to 75% of those in control samples. In addition, augmented protein O-GlcNAc modification correlates to decreased OGA protein levels in AD subjects. While OGA inhibitors are already being tested for AD treatment, our results provide a strong indication that the general subject of O-GlcNAcylation and specifically its regulation by OGA and OGT in AD need further investigation to conclusively elucidate its potential role in AD pathogenesis and treatment.  
24732579	Estrogen Receptor Î± Variants Affect Age at Onset of Alzheimer's Disease in a Multiethnic Female Cohort.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140408 2014
Few studies of gene variants that affect estrogen activity investigate their association with age at onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women of different ethnicities. We examined the influence of ESR1 polymorphisms on age at onset of AD in a multiethnic cohort of women. Among 1,436 women participating in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project, association with age at AD onset was assessed for 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the ESR1 gene using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for presence of an APOE Îµ4 allele, years of education, and body mass index. Six SNPs in self-identified White women were protectively associated with delayed age of AD onset in this self-identified group, including the two restriction fragment length polymorphisms PvuII (rs2234693) and XbaI (rs9340799) (HR range = 0.420-0.483). Two separate SNPs were found to affect age of AD onset in self-identified Black women. ESR1 polymorphisms affect age of onset of AD in women, and risk alleles vary by ethnicity. These effects are possibly due to different linkage disequilibrium patterns or differences in comorbid environmental or cultural risk factors mediating the SNP effect on risk for AD. Â© 2014 S.

24903099	Higher working memory predicts slower functional decline in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140604 2014
There is heterogeneity in the pattern of early cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether the severity of initial cognitive deficits relates to different clinical trajectories of AD progression is unclear. To determine if deficits in specific cognitive domains at the initial visit relate to the rate of progression in clinical trajectories of AD dementia. 68 subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database who had autopsy-confirmed AD as the primary diagnosis and at least 3 serial assessments a year apart, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &gt;15 and a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Global (CDR-G) score â‰¤1 at the initial visit were included. A mixed regression model was used to examine the association between initial neuropsychological performance and rate of change on the MMSE and CDR Sum of Boxes. Preservation of working memory, but not episodic memory, in the mild cognitive impairment and early dementia stages of AD relates to slower rate of functional decline. These findings are relevant for estimating the rate of decline in AD clinical trials and in counseling patients and families. Improving working memory performance as a possible avenue to decrease the rate of functional decline in AD dementia warrants closer investigation. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel. 
25140107	Clinical Study of Respiratory Function and Difference in Pneumonia History between Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia Groups.
J Phys Ther Sci 20140730 2014Jul
[Purpose] This study compared respiratory function and differences in pneumonia history between Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia groups. [Subjects] Fifty-eight inpatients in the dementia treatment ward in a psychiatric facility were enrolled. [Methods] Patients underwent respiratory function testing twice using an 80-cm party horn. The Mini-Mental State Examination was also performed and motor functions were evaluated. Patient characteristics were obtained from medical records. [Results] Significant differences were noted between Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia groups in the ability to blow the party horn to full length, pneumonia history, and presence of impaired mobility. [Conclusion] Party horn evaluation may be useful for determining the risk of pneumonia in patients with dementia.  
25140287	Development of a novel cellular model of Alzheimer's disease utilizing neurosphere cultures derived from B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J embryonic mouse brain.
Springerplus 20140326 2014
Increased production, oligomerization and aggregation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides are hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Expressing familial AD mutations (amyloid precursor protein and/or presenilins mutations), the AÎ²-pathologies of AD has been recapitulated in animal models of AD. Very few primary cell culture-based models of AD are available and they exhibit very weak AÎ²-pathologies compared to what is seen in AD patients and animal models of AD. CNS stem/progenitor cells are present in both embryonic and adult brains. They can be isolated, grown as neurospheres and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. It is not yet known whether CNS stem/progenitor cells can support the production of AÎ² peptides in culture. In this report, we have established AÎ²-pathologies such as production, secretion, oligomerization and aggregation of AÎ² peptides utilizing neurosphere cultures to create a new cellular model of AD. These cultures were developed from E15 embryonic brains of transgenic mice carrying the Swedish mutations in humanized mouse APP cDNA and the exon-9 deleted human presenilin 1 cDNA both regulated by mouse prion protein gene (Prnp) promoter. Results demonstrated the expression of transgene transcripts, APPswe protein and its processed products only in transgene positive neurosphere cultures. These cultures generate and secrete both AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 peptides into culture medium at levels comparable to the AÎ² load in the brain of AD patients and animal models of AD, and produce pathogenic oligomers of AÎ² peptides. The AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio in the medium of transgene positive neurosphere cultures is higher than any known cellular models of AD. Conformation dependent immunocytochemistry demonstrated the possible presence of intracellular and extracellular aggregation of AÎ² peptides in neurosphere cultures, which are also seen in AD brain and animal models of AD. Collectively, our neurosphere cultures provide robust AÎ²-pathologies of AD better than existing cellular model of Alzheimer's disease.  
24777780	The genetic contributions of SNCA and LRRK2 genes to Lewy Body pathology in Alzheimer's disease.

The molecular genetic basis that leads to Lewy Body (LB) pathology in 15-20% of Alzheimer disease cases (LBV/AD) was largely unknown. Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and Leucine-rich repeat kinase2 (LRRK2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), the prototype of LB spectrum disorders. We tested the association of SNCA variants with LB pathology in AD. We then stratified the SNCA association analyses by LRRK2 genotype. We also investigated the expression regulation of SNCA and LRRK2 in relation to LB pathology. We evaluated the differences in SNCA-mRNA and LRRK2-mRNA levels as a function of LB pathology in the temporal cortex (TC) from autopsy-confirmed LBV/AD cases and AD controls. We further investigated the cis-effect of the LB pathology-associated genetic variants within the SNCA and LRRK2 loci on the mRNA expression of these genes. SNCA SNPs rs3857059 and rs2583988 showed significant associations with increased risk for LB pathology. When the analyses were stratified by LRRK2-rs1491923 genotype, the associations became stronger for both SNPs and an association was also observed with rs2619363. Expression analysis demonstrated that SNCA- and LRRK2-mRNA levels were significantly higher in TC from LBV/AD brains compared with AD controls. Furthermore, SNCA-mRNA expression level in the TC was associated with rs3857059; homozygotes for the minor allele showed significant higher expression. LRRK2-transcript levels were increased in carriers of rs1491923 minor allele. Our findings demonstrated that SNCA contributes to LB pathology in AD patients, possibly via interaction with LRRK2, and suggested that expression regulation of these genes may be the molecular basis underlying the observed LB associations.  
24824215	Genetic deletion of TNFRII gene enhances the Alzheimer-like pathology in an APP transgenic mouse model via reduction of phosphorylated IÎºBÎ±.
Hum. Mol. Genet. 20140513 2014Sep15
Tumor necrosis factor receptor II (TNFRII) is one of the TNF receptor superfamily members and our recent pathological studies show that TNFRII is deficient in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms of TNFRII in AD pathogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, by using the gene-targeting approach to delete TNFRII in AD transgenic mouse model, we found that, in the brain of APP23 mice with TNFRII deletion (APP23/TNFRII(-/-)), AD-like pathology, i.e. plaque formation and microglial activation, occurs as early as 6 months of age. To test whether the increased levels of AÎ² plaques was due to elevated AÎ², we measured AÎ² and found that AÎ² levels indeed were significantly increased at this age. Because Î²-secretase, BACE1, is critical enzyme for AÎ² production, we have examined BACE1 and found that BACE1 is increased in both protein levels and enzymatic activity as early as 6 months of age; Having shown that BACE1 promoter region contains NF-ÎºB binding sites, we found that cytoplasmic NF-ÎºB was elevated and SUMO1 binding to IÎºBÎ± was decreased. To further verify these findings, we have overexpressed TNFRII and identified that overexpressing TNFRII can reverse the findings from APP23/TNFRII(-/-) mice. Altogether, our results demonstrate novel roles of TNFRII in the regulation of AÎ² production, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for AD by up-regulating TNFRII levels and elevating phosphorylated IÎºBÎ± by SUMOylation.  
25081412	Efficacy and safety studies of gantenerumab in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Expert Rev Neurother 20140801 2014Sep
Among active and passive anti-Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), bapineuzumab and solanezumab, two humanized monoclonal antibodies, failed to show significant clinical benefits in mild-to-moderate AD patients in large Phase III clinical trials. Another ongoing Phase III trial of solanezumab aims to confirm positive findings in mild AD patients. Gantenerumab is the first fully human anti-AÎ² monoclonal antibody directed to both N-terminal and central regions of AÎ². A 6-month PET study in 16 AD patients showed that gantenerumab treatment dose-dependently reduced brain AÎ² deposition, possibly stimulating microglial-mediated phagocytosis. Two ongoing Phase III trials of gantenerumab in patients with prodromal or mild dementia due to AD will determine if any reduction in brain AÎ² levels will translate into clinical benefits. An ongoing secondary prevention trial of gantenerumab in presymptomatic subjects with genetic mutations for autosomal-dominant AD will verify the utility of anti-AÎ² monoclonal antibodies as prevention therapy.  
25148535	Can antidepressant medication relieve agitation in Alzheimer's disease?
Expert Rev Neurother  2014Sep
Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are a major concern in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Historically, NPS are difficult to treat effectively due to a high side-effect burden associated with commonly used medications, such as atypical antipsychotics. Non-pharmacological treatment approaches have become the first line option. However, when such treatment fails, pharmacological options are often used. Thus, a push toward finding safer alternative pharmacological treatments has occurred. Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown promise in clinical trials for alleviating the burden of NPS. Lower overall agitation and caregiver stress has been reported to correlate to treatment with the SSRI citalopram. However, certain side effects of citalopram, such as QTc interval prolongation and increased cognitive decline, carry clinical concern and should be weighed when prescribing their use.  
25012481	Association study of two steroid biosynthesis genes (COMT and CYP17) with Alzheimer's disease in the Italian population.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20140629 2014Sep15
The greater predisposition of women to Alzheimer's disease (AD), owing to the decrease in postmenopausal estrogen, may be influenced by polymorphic variation in genes regulating estrogen metabolism (e.g., COMT) and estrogen biosynthesis (e.g., CYP17). In order to better understand how the estrogen pathway genetic variation might affect AD onset, we conducted a case-control study of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these two genes (COMT rs4680 and CYP17 rs743572) in a sample of AD patients of Italian origin. The COMT allele and genotype were found associated neither with AD onset nor with parameters of AD severity, such as cognitive impairment, age at onset, or disease duration. In contrast, CYP17 was found to affect the age at disease onset mainly in males and, as compared with noncarriers, people carrying the A2 (C) allele had a 2.2-fold increased risk for AD. These findings suggest that the CYP17 A2 allele influences AD susceptibility in a sex-specific way by acting not only on AD risk but also on the age at disease onset, an important parameter of AD severity.  
25150118	Oligonol improves memory and cognition under an amyloid Î²25-35-induced Alzheimer's mouse model.
Nutr Res 20140614 2014Jul
Alzheimer's disease is an age-dependent progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in impairments of memory and cognitive function. It is hypothesized that oligonol has ameliorative effects on memory impairment and reduced cognitive functions in mice with Alzheimer's disease induced by amyloid Î²25-35 (AÎ²25-35) injection. The protective effect of an oligonol against AÎ²25-35-induced memory impairment was investigated in an in vivo Alzheimer's mouse model. The aggregation of AÎ²25-35 was induced by incubation at 37Â°C for 3 days before injection into mice brains (5 nmol/mouse), and then oligonol was orally administered at 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight for 2 weeks. Memory and cognition were observed in T-maze, object recognition, and Morris water maze tests. The group injected with AÎ²25-35 showed impairments in both recognition and memory. However, novel object recognition and new route awareness abilities were dose dependently improved by the oral administration of oligonol. In addition, the results of the Morris water maze test indicated that oligonol exerted protective activity against cognitive impairment induced by AÎ²25-35. Furthermore, nitric oxide formation and lipid peroxidation were significantly elevated by AÎ²25-35, whereas oligonol treatment significantly decreased nitric oxide formation and lipid peroxidation in the brain, liver, and kidneys. The present results suggest that oligonol improves AÎ²25-35-induced memory deficit and cognition impairment.  
24177174	Increase in Alzheimer's related markers preceeds memory disturbances: studies in vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rat.
Brain Res. Bull. 20131028 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. For more effective therapy early diagnostic markers could be beneficial. Therefore we compared one year old rats with adults and examined if changes in possible brain markers of AD preceeded memory decline. We also tested if vasopressin-deficient animals were useful model of AD as vasopressin has well known positive effect on memory and AD patient has decreased vasopressin production. We compared adult (3 month) and old (12 month), normal and vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats. To receive a comprehensive picture about their memory we examined their social discrimination, object discrimination and conditioned learning abilities (shuttle box). Amyloid precursor protein (APP), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), Î²-actin and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) mRNA levels was measured by quantitative PCR. There was no difference between the memory of adult and aged groups. The vasopressin-deficient rats at both ages showed a weaker performance in the course of social and object discrimination tests and a higher escape failure during the shuttle box experiment. The brain marker mRNAs of the elder animals were higher than the levels of the adults, but the absence of vasopressin had no influence on them. Thus, the one year old rats showed elevated levels of AD-related markers, but memory deficits were observable only in vasopressin deficient animals. Vasopressin does not seem to have pathogenic role in AD. Changes in the studied markers might predict later symptoms, although further studies are required for confirmation.  
24232933	Associations between age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer disease, and dementia: record linkage study of hospital admissions.
JAMA Ophthalmol  2014Jan
The potential association between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) is uncertain and has implications for understanding disease pathogenesis, referral, and treatments. To determine whether individuals admitted to the hospital with AMD were significantly more or less likely to develop AD or dementia in the following years, as well as to assess whether people with AD or dementia were significantly more or less likely to be admitted to the hospital for AMD treatment in the years following diagnosis of dementia. An AMD cohort of 65,894 people was constructed from English National Health Service, linked hospital episode statistics from January 1, 1999, through February 28, 2011, by identifying computerized record abstracts for all people with an admission or day case care for AMD. A dementia cohort (168,092 people) and a reference cohort (&gt;7.7 million people) were constructed in similar ways. Risk of AD or dementia following AMD and risk of AMD following AD or dementia. Rate ratios were calculated based on standardized rates of AD and dementia in the AMD cohort, as well as standardized rates of AMD in the AD and dementia cohort, relative to those in the reference cohort. RESULTS The risk of AD or dementia following AMD was not elevated. The rate ratio was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.67-1.08) for AD and 0.91 (0.79-1.04) for dementia. The likelihood of being admitted for AMD following AD or dementia was very low: the rate ratio was 0.04 (0.01-0.10) for people with AD and 0.07 (0.04-0.11) for those with dementia. These neurodegenerative conditions may share environmental risk factors and histopathologic features. However, considering AD and other dementia after AMD, their coexistence at the individual level is no different from that expected by chance. Our data also suggest that patients in England with dementia may be substantially less likely to receive AMD treatment. Further research is required to determine whether people with dementia receive appropriate investigation and treatment for AMD, as well as identify and address potential barriers. 
24464041	Tau promotes neurodegeneration through global chromatin relaxation.
Nat. Neurosci. 20140126 2014Mar
The microtubule-associated protein tau is involved in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have linked oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage to neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies. Given that DNA damage can substantially alter chromatin structure, we examined epigenetic changes in tau-induced neurodegeneration. We found widespread loss of heterochromatin in tau transgenic Drosophila and mice and in human Alzheimer's disease. Notably, genetic rescue of tau-induced heterochromatin loss substantially reduced neurodegeneration in Drosophila. We identified oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage as a mechanistic link between transgenic tau expression and heterochromatin relaxation, and found that heterochromatin loss permitted aberrant gene expression in tauopathies. Furthermore, large-scale analyses from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease revealed a widespread transcriptional increase in genes that were heterochromatically silenced in controls. Our results establish heterochromatin loss as a toxic effector of tau-induced neurodegeneration and identify chromatin structure as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.  
24956891	In vitro evaluation of anti-Alzheimer effects of dry ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) extract.
Indian J. Exp. Biol.  2014Jun
As the disease modifying therapies against Alzheimer's disease (AD) continue to exist as a major challenge of this century, the search for newer drug leads with lesser side effects is on the rise. A large number of plant extracts and phytocompounds are being actively pursued for their anti-Alzheimer effects. In the present study, the antioxidant activity, cholinesterase inhibition, anti-amyloidogenic potential and neuroprotective properties of methanolic extract of dry ginger (GE) have been evaluated. The extract contained 18 +/- 0.6 mg/g gallic acid equivalents of total phenolic content and 4.18 +/- 0.69 mg quercetin equivalents/g of dry material. GE expressed high antioxidant activity with an IC50 value of 70 +/- 0.304 microg/mL in DPPH assay and 845.4 +/- 56.62 microM Fe(II) equivalents/g dry weight in FRAP assay respectively. In Ellman's assay for the cholinesterase inhibitory activity, GE had an IC50 value of 41 +/- 1.2 microg/mL and 52 +/- 2 microg/mL for inhibition of acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase respectively. Also, GE increased the cell survival against amyloid beta (Abeta) induced toxicity in primary adult rat hippocampal cell culture. Aggregation experiments with the thioflavin T binding studies showed that GE effectively prevented the formation of Abeta oligomers and dissociated the preformed oligomers. These findings suggest that methanolic GE influences multiple therapeutic molecular targets of AD and can be considered as an effective nontoxic neutraceutical supplement for AD. 
24961795	Amyloid precursor protein and neural development.
Development  2014Jul
Interest in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has increased in recent years due to its involvement in Alzheimer's disease. Since its molecular cloning, significant genetic and biochemical work has focused on the role of APP in the pathogenesis of this disease. Thus far, however, these studies have failed to deliver successful therapies. This suggests that understanding the basic biology of APP and its physiological role during development might be a crucial missing link for a better comprehension of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present an overview of some of the key studies performed in various model organisms that have revealed roles for APP at different stages of neuronal development.  
24156281	Positive affect and sleep in spousal Alzheimer caregivers: a longitudinal study.
Behav Sleep Med 20131024 2014Sep3
This article examines the longitudinal relation between positive affect (PA) and sleep in 126 spousal Alzheimer's disease caregivers. Caregivers underwent 4 yearly assessments for the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the self-rated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and actigraphy to objectify nighttime total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and percentage of sleep. Increased levels of PA and a greater positivity (i.e., positive-to-negative affect) ratio were significantly associated with better subjective sleep over the entire study period. Yearly increases in PA-even when controlling for negative affect (NA)-and in the positivity ratio were also associated with better subjective sleep. PA and actigraphy measures showed no significant relations. Increased PA is longitudinally associated with better sleep in dementia caregivers largely independent of NA.  
25025038	Dipeptidyl peptidase 10 (DPP10(789)): a voltage gated potassium channel associated protein is abnormally expressed in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Biomed Res Int 20140616 2014
The neuropathological features associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) include the presence of extracellular amyloid-Î² peptide-containing plaques and intracellular tau positive neurofibrillary tangles and the loss of synapses and neurons in defined regions of the brain. Dipeptidyl peptidase 10 (DPP10) is a protein that facilitates Kv4 channel surface expression and neuronal excitability. This study aims to explore DPP10789 protein distribution in human brains and its contribution to the neurofibrillary pathology of AD and other tauopathies. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed predominant neuronal staining of DPP10789 in control brains, and the CA1 region of the hippocampus contained strong reactivity in the distal dendrites of the pyramidal cells. In AD brains, robust DPP10789 reactivity was detected in neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites, most of which colocalized with the doubly phosphorylated Ser-202/Thr-205 tau epitope. DPP10789 positive neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites also appeared in other neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, diffuse Lewy body disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Occasional DPP10789 positive neurofibrillary tangles and neurites were seen in some aged control brains. Western blot analysis showed both full length and truncated DPP10789 fragments with the later increasing significantly in AD brains compared to control brains. Our results suggest that DPP10789 is involved in the pathology of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.  
25024739	Dynamic regulatory network reconstruction for Alzheimer's disease based on matrix decomposition techniques.
Comput Math Methods Med 20140615 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and leads to irreversible neurodegenerative damage of the brain. Finding the dynamic responses of genes, signaling proteins, transcription factor (TF) activities, and regulatory networks of the progressively deteriorative progress of AD would represent a significant advance in discovering the pathogenesis of AD. However, the high throughput technologies of measuring TF activities are not yet available on a genome-wide scale. In this study, based on DNA microarray gene expression data and a priori information of TFs, network component analysis (NCA) algorithm is applied to determining the TF activities and regulatory influences on TGs of incipient, moderate, and severe AD. Based on that, the dynamical gene regulatory networks of the deteriorative courses of AD were reconstructed. To select significant genes which are differentially expressed in different courses of AD, independent component analysis (ICA), which is better than the traditional clustering methods and can successfully group one gene in different meaningful biological processes, was used. The molecular biological analysis showed that the changes of TF activities and interactions of signaling proteins in mitosis, cell cycle, immune response, and inflammation play an important role in the deterioration of AD.  
25023513	Cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairments in Alzheimer's disease: current treatment strategies.
Curr Psychiatry Rep  2014Sep
This update on Alzheimer's disease (AD) discusses treatment strategies for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (such as agitation, psychosis, anxiety, and depression) common in this illness, emphasizing in particular nonpharmacologic strategies such as cognitive interventions, physical exercise, and psychotherapy. We provide an overview of cognitive enhancers and their combination strategies and medications commonly used for treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. Finally, we give recommendations for providing support toÂ caregivers and suggest how to identify caregiver/patient pairs most in need of intensive dementia care services.  
24907904	An increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in Alzheimer's disease is a function of age and is weakly correlated with neocortical amyloid accumulation.
J. Neuroimmunol. 20140520 2014Aug15
Inflammation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether directly involved in the pathogenesis, or a downstream consequence of neuronal death, the blood neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is reported to be a putative, non-invasive peripheral biomarker for AD. The aim of this study was to re-evaluate the diagnostic utility of longitudinal measures of the NLR. The NLR was stable across all time-points and weakly correlated with neocortical amyloid burden (R=0.21 at baseline, 0.27 at 18 months, 0.20 at 36 months and 0.10 at 54 months). Cross-sectionally, the NLR was significantly elevated in AD participants as compared to HC participants at baseline (p&lt;0.0001), 18 months (p&lt;0.0001), 36 months (p=0.002) and at 54 months (p=0.007), however only prior to adjustment for age, sex and APOEÎµ4 allele status (p&gt;0.05 at all time-points except for 18 months; p&lt;0.0001). Longitudinally, the NLR was not significantly different between HC and AD participants (p&gt;0.05) adjusted for age, sex and APOEÎµ4 allele status. Comparing the NLR between cognitive transition groups over time (transition towards an AD type dementia), there was no significant difference in the NLR levels between those participants, who did not transition and those participants who did transition, or those in the stable AD group after adjusting for age, sex and APOEÎµ4 allele status (p&gt;0.05). Despite inflammation being a hallmark in AD and previous reports showing that the NLR can discriminate HC from AD patients, our results suggest that the sensitivity of the NLR itself is not robust enough for diagnostic utility. We identified significant relationships cross sectionally (p&lt;0.05 at baseline, 18 months and 36 months) between the NLR and neocortical amyloid burden, but this relationship was lost after longitudinal analyses (p&gt;0.5). The NLR also had limited association with cognitive decline, although in our cohort, the number of participants transitioning was relatively small. In conclusion, the NLR may reflect AD-related inflammatory processes in the periphery, but age and sex are dominant covariates which need to be controlled for in population-based screening. 
24909950	Quantitative assessment of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and risk of Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20140526 2014Aug15
CYP2D6 gene encoding CYP2D6 enzyme belonging to the cytochrome P450 system has aroused long attention being a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the results remain inconsistent and underpowered. To investigate the contradictory results, the effect of single CYP2D6 polymorphism- CYP2D6*4, together with CYP2D6 phenotypes on the risk of AD, was evaluated using a meta-analysis. Electronic database search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library was conducted up to Apr 17, 2014. Odds ratio (OR) along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Subgroup analysis was performed to examine the impact of CYP2D6 variants on different ethnic. Meta-regression was performed to explore possible source of heterogeneity. A total of 11 studies involving 643AD cases and 1375 controls were included for CYP2D6*4 polymorphism, and 4 studies consisted of 411AD cases and 603 controls were included for CYP2D6 phenotypes. With respect to CYP2D6*4 polymorphism, significantly increased risk of AD was found in allelic contrast model of A vs. G (OR=1.29, 95%CI=1.03-1.62, P=0.026), co-dominant genetic model AA vs. GG (OR=1.91, 95%CI=1.04-3.51, P=0.038); and recessive genetic model AA vs. AG+GG (OR=1.88, 95%CI=1.03-3.46, P=0.041) in the overall populations. Similar results were also indicated in subgroup analysis in Caucasians. As for CYP2D6 phenotypes, no significant association with AD was revealed. Our data support that the CYP2D6*4 polymorphism but not CYP2D6 phenotypes might be associated with increased AD risk, particularly in Caucasian populations. 
24950901	Different patterns of brain activation in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease from cognitional sight: meta analysis using activation likelihood estimation.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20140606 2014Aug15
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurological disease, frequently affecting cognitional functions. Recently, a large body of neuro-imaging studies have aimed at finding reliable biomarkers of AD for early diagnosis of disease in contrast with healthy elderlies. We intended to have a meta-analytical study on recent functional neuroimaging studies to find the relationship between cognition in AD patients and normal elderlies. A systematic search was conducted to collect functional neuroimaging studies such as positron emission therapy (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in AD patients and healthy elderlies. The coordinates of regions related to cognition were meta-analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method and Sleuth software. P-value map at the false discovery rate (FDR) of P&lt;0.05 thresholds and the clusters with a minimum size of 200 mm(3) were considered. Data were visualized with MANGO software. Forty-one articles that explored the areas activated during cognition in normal elderly subjects and AD patients were found. According to the findings, left middle frontal gyrus and left precuneus are the most activated areas in cognitional tasks in healthy elderlies and AD patients respectively. In normal elderly subjects and AD patients, comparison of ALE maps and reverse contrast showed that insula and left precuneus were the most activated areas in cognitional aspects respectively. With respect to unification of left precuneus activation in cognitional tasks, it seems that this point can be a hallmark in primary differentiation of AD and healthy individuals. 
24760339	TDP-43 in Alzheimer's disease is not associated with clinical FTLD or Parkinsonism.
J. Neurol. 20140424 2014Jul
Widespread deposition of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43Â kDa (TDP-43), a major protein inclusion commonly found in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can also be seen in a subset of cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some of these AD cases have TDP-43 immunoreactivity in basal ganglia (BG) and substantia nigra (SN), regions that when affected can be associated with parkinsonian signs or symptoms, or even features suggestive of frontotemporal dementia. Here, we examined the presence of clinical features of FTLD, parkinsonian signs and symptoms, and BG atrophy on MRI, in 51 pathologically confirmed AD cases (Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage IV-VI) with widespread TDP-43 deposition, with and without BG and SN involvement. All 51 cases had presented with progressive cognitive impairment with prominent memory deficits. None of the patients demonstrated early behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, stereotyped behavior, hyperorality, and/or executive deficits. Furthermore, TDP-43 deposition in BG or SN had no significant association with tremor (pÂ =Â 0.80), rigidity (pÂ =Â 0.19), bradykinesia (pÂ =Â 0.19), and gait/postural instability (pÂ =Â 0.39). Volumes of the BG structures were not associated with TDP-43 deposition in the BG. The present study demonstrates that TDP-43 deposition in pathologically confirmed AD cases is not associated with a clinical manifestation suggestive of FTLD, or parkinsonian features.  
24797962	Clinical predictors of severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy and influence of APOE genotype in persons with pathologically verified Alzheimer disease.
JAMA Neurol  2014Jul1
Although cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has important clinical implications, our understanding of it and ability to diagnose it are limited. To determine pathological correlates and clinical factors identifiable during life that predict the presence of severe CAA in persons with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease (AD). We compared demographic and clinical variables at the earliest visit during life at which participants were found to have cognitive impairment and compared pathological variables between persons ultimately found to have no or severe CAA at autopsy using logistic regression. Analyses were repeated separately for carriers and noncarriers of the APOE Îµ4 allele. Data were obtained from the Uniform Data Set, which comprises longitudinal clinical assessments performed in the Alzheimer's Disease Centers funded by the National Institute on Aging. Participants included 193 persons with AD and severe CAA and 232 persons with AD and no CAA. All participants had cognitive impairment and met National Institute on Aging-Reagan Institute neuropathological criteria for AD. Prevalence of demographic characteristics and the APOE Îµ4 allele and odds ratios (ORs) of clinical variables for the prediction of severe CAA. Persons with severe CAA compared with those without CAA were more likely to carry an APOE Îµ4 allele (64.9% vs 42.8%, respectively; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), to be Hispanic (6.8% vs 1.3%, respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰.003), to have had a transient ischemic attack (12.5% vs 6.1%, respectively; ORâ€‰=â€‰2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.4), and to have lower degrees of diffuse amyloid plaque pathology (mean [SD] Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score, 1.2 [0.5] vs 1.4 [0.8], respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01). Those with CAA compared with those without CAA more commonly had intracerebral hemorrhage (9.3% vs 3.5%, respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01), cortical microinfarcts (20.7% vs 12.9%, respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰.03), and subcortical leukoencephalopathy (20.5% vs 12.1%, respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02). Noncarriers of the APOE Îµ4 allele with severe CAA compared with those without CAA had a higher prevalence of stroke (11.1% vs 3.9%, respectively; ORâ€‰=â€‰3.8; 95% CI, 1.0-14.6) and hypercholesterolemia (50.0% vs 32.7%, respectively; ORâ€‰=â€‰2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.7). Being Hispanic and having had a transient ischemic attack-like episode were predictors of CAA in persons with AD. Less diffuse parenchymal amyloid pathology in persons with severe CAA suggests a difference in Î²-amyloid trafficking. 
24818585	Associations between cerebral small-vessel disease and Alzheimer disease pathology as measured by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.
JAMA Neurol  2014Jul1
It remains unclear if and how associations between cerebral small-vessel disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology lead to cognitive decline and dementia. To determine associations between small-vessel disease and AD pathology. Cross-sectional study from January 2002 to December 2012 using the memory clinic-based Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. The study included 914 consecutive patients with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging; 547 were patients diagnosed as having AD (54% female, mean [SD], 67 [8]; Mini-Mental State Examination score, mean [SD], 21 [5]), 30 were patients diagnosed as having vascular dementia (37% female, mean [SD], 76 [9]; Mini-Mental State Examination score, mean [SD], 24 [4]), and 337 were control participants with subjective memory complaints (42% female, mean [SD], 59 [59]; Mini-Mental State Examination score, mean [SD], 28 [2]). Linear regressions were performed with CSF biomarkers (log transformed) as dependent variables and magnetic resonance imaging measures (dichotomized) as independent, adjusted for sex, age, mediotemporal lobe atrophy, and diagnosis. An interaction term for diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging measures was used for estimates per diagnostic group. We examined the associations of magnetic resonance imaging white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, microbleeds with CSF Î²-amyloid 42 (AÎ²42), total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181) as well as for a subset of apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 carriers and noncarriers. Microbleed presence was associated with lower CSF AÎ²42 in AD and vascular dementia (standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰-0.09, Pâ€‰=â€‰.003; standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰-0.30, Pâ€‰=â€‰.01), and higher CSF tau in controls (standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰0.10, Pâ€‰=â€‰.03). There were no effects for P-tau181. The presence of WMH was associated with lower AÎ²42 in control participants and patients with vascular dementia (standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰-0.18, Pâ€‰=â€‰.002; standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰-0.32, Pâ€‰=â€‰.02) but not in patients with AD. There were no effects for tau or P-tau181. The presence of lacunes was associated with higher AÎ²42 in vascular dementia (standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰0.17, Pâ€‰=â€‰.07) and lower tau in AD (standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰-0.07, Pâ€‰=â€‰.05) but there were no effects for AÎ²42 or P-tau181. Stratification for apolipoprotein E genotype revealed that these effects were mostly attributable to Îµ4 carriers. Deposition of amyloid appears aggravated in patients with cerebral small-vessel disease, especially in apolipoprotein E Îµ4 carriers, providing evidence for pathophysiological synergy between these 3 biological factors. 
25082505	Vascular dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease: a potential etiological linkage.
Med Sci Monit Basic Res 20140801 2014
The endothelium performs a crucial role in maintaining vascular integrity leading to whole organ metabolic homeostasis. Endothelial dysfunction represents a key etiological factor leading to moderate to severe vasculopathies observed in both Type 2 diabetic and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. Accordingly, evidence-based epidemiological factors support a compelling hypothesis stating that metabolic rundown encountered in Type 2 diabetes engenders severe cerebral vascular insufficiencies that are causally linked to long term neural degenerative processes in AD. Of mechanistic importance, Type 2 diabetes engenders an immunologically mediated chronic pro-inflammatory state involving interactive deleterious effects of leukocyte-derived cytokines and endothelial-derived chemotactic agents leading to vascular and whole organ dysfunction. The long term negative consequences of vascular pro-inflammatory processes on the integrity of CNS basal forebrain neuronal populations mediating complex cognitive functions establish a striking temporal comorbidity of AD with Type 2 diabetes. Extensive biomedical evidence supports the pivotal multi-functional role of constitutive nitric oxide (NO) production and release as a critical vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant, mechanism within the vascular endothelium. Within this context, we currently review the functional contributions of dysregulated endothelial NO expression to the etiology and persistence of Type 2 diabetes-related and co morbid AD-related vasculopathies. Additionally, we provide up-to-date perspectives on critical areas of AD research with special reference to common NO-related etiological factors linking Type 2 diabetes to the pathogenesis of AD.

23138174	Comparative Analysis of the Alzheimer Questionnaire (AQ) With the CDR Sum of Boxes, MoCA, and MMSE.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jul-Sep
The Alzheimer Questionnaire (AQ) has been established as a valid and accurate informant-based screening questionnaire for Alzheimer disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Although the AQ's validity and diagnostic accuracy has been established, its performance in comparison with other instruments has not. Thirty-nine amnestic mild cognitive impairment cases and 34 Alzheimer disease cases were matched on the basis of age, education, and sex to 73 cognitively normal individuals. The sample had a mean age of 82.54Â±7.77 years and a mean education level of 14.61Â±2.61 years. The diagnostic accuracy of the CDR Sum of Boxes, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were compared with the AQ. The AQ correlated strongly with the CDR Sum of Boxes (r=0.79) and demonstrated similar diagnostic accuracy with the MoCA and MMSE. These results suggest that the AQ is comparable with other established informant-based and patient-based measures.  
24577205	Social Relationships and Risk of Incident Mild Cognitive Impairment in US Alzheimer's Disease Centers.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jul-Sep
Social relationships are hypothesized to prevent or slow cognitive decline. We sought to evaluate associations between social relationships and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database who were cognitively normal, aged 55 and older at baseline, and had at least 2 in-person visits (n=5335) were included. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models evaluated the association between 4 social relationships at baseline (marital status, living situation, having children, and having siblings) and risk of developing MCI (on the basis of clinician diagnosis following established criteria). Primary models were adjusted for baseline demographics. Participants were followed, on average, for 3.2 years; 15.2% were diagnosed with MCI. Compared with married participants, risk of MCI was significantly lower for widowed participants (hazard ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.99) but not for divorced/separated or never-married participants. Compared with living with a spouse/partner, risk of MCI was significantly higher for living with others (hazard ratio: 1.35; 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.77) but not for living alone. Risk of MCI was not associated with having children or having siblings. These results did not consistently identify social relationships as a strong risk factor for, or independent clinical predictor of, MCI.  
24614272	Community engagement in diverse populations for Alzheimer disease prevention trials.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jul-Sep
The recruitment of asymptomatic volunteers has been identified as a critical factor that is delaying the development and validation of preventive therapies for Alzheimer disease (AD). Typical recruitment strategies involve the use of convenience samples or soliciting participation of older adults with a family history of AD from clinics and outreach efforts. However, high-risk groups, such as ethnic/racial minorities, are traditionally less likely to be recruited for AD prevention studies, thus limiting the ability to generalize findings for a significant proportion of the aging population. A community-engagement approach was used to create a registry of 2311 research-ready, healthy adult volunteers who reflect the ethnically diverse local community. Furthermore, the registry's actual commitment to research was examined, through demonstrated participation rates in a clinical study. The approach had varying levels of success in establishing a large, diverse pool of individuals who are interested in participating in pharmacological prevention trials and meet the criteria for primary prevention research trials designed to delay the onset of AD. Our efforts suggest that entry criteria for the clinical trials need to be carefully considered to be inclusive of African Americans, and that sustained effort is needed to engage African Americans in pharmacological prevention approaches.  
24731980	Distinctive RNA expression profiles in blood associated with Alzheimer disease after accounting for white matter hyperintensities.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jul-Sep
Defining the RNA transcriptome in Alzheimer Disease (AD) will help understand the disease mechanisms and provide biomarkers. Though the AD blood transcriptome has been studied, effects of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were not considered. This study investigated the AD blood transcriptome and accounted for WMH. RNA from whole blood was processed on whole-genome microarrays. A total of 293 probe sets were differentially expressed in AD versus controls, 5 of which were significant for WMH status. The 288 AD-specific probe sets classified subjects with 87.5% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity. They represented 188 genes of which 29 have been reported in prior AD blood and 89 in AD brain studies. Regulated blood genes included MMP9, MME (Neprilysin), TGFÎ²1, CA4, OCLN, ATM, TGM3, IGFR2, NOV, RNF213, BMX, LRRN1, CAMK2G, INSR, CTSD, SORCS1, SORL1, and TANC2. RNA expression is altered in AD blood irrespective of WMH status. Some genes are shared with AD brain. 
25120180	Large-scale analysis of posttranslational modifications in the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease using pI shift and label-free quantification without enrichment.
Anal Bioanal Chem 20140815 2014Sep
Posttranslational modifications modulate protein function in cells. Global analysis of multiple posttranslational modifications can provide insight into physiology and disease, but presents formidable challenges. In the present study, we used a technique that does not require target enrichment to analyze alterations in the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of proteins from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Guided by our previous findings, we applied three strategies to further our understanding of the dysregulation of posttranslationally modified proteins. We first identified phosphorylation sites by determining peptide pI shifts using OFFGEL. Second, using tandem mass spectrometry, we determined the ubiquitination status of the proteins using an assay for a trypsin digestion remnant of ubiquitination (Gly-Gly). Third, for large-scale discovery, we quantified the global differences in protein expression. Of the proteins expressed in AD tissue at levels of 2.0 or greater compared with controls, 60 were phosphorylated and 56 were ubiquitinated. Of the proteins expressed at levels of 0.5 or lower compared with controls, 81 were phosphorylated and 56 were ubiquitinated. Approximately 98Â % of the phosphopeptides exhibited a pI shift. We identified 112 new phosphorylation sites (51.38Â %), and 92 new ubiquitination sites (96.84Â %). Taken together, our findings suggest that analysis of the alterations in posttranslationally modified proteins may contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of AD and other diseases.  
24810551	The Molecular Structure of Alzheimer Î²-Amyloid Fibrils Formed in the Presence of Phospholipid Vesicles.
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 20140508 2014Aug25
Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) fibrils are the major species involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). An atomic-resolution molecular structure of AÎ²40 fibrils formed in the presence of lipid vesicles was obtained by using magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The fibril structures formed in the presence of the lipid vesicles are remarkably different from those formed in solution. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of AÎ² aggregation in the presence of lipid vesicles.  
25144717	Amyloid-Î² induces NLRP1-dependent neuronal pyroptosis in models of Alzheimer's disease.
Cell Death Dis 20140821 2014
Increasing evidence has shown the aberrant expression of inflammasome-related proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain; these proteins, including NLRP1 inflammasome, are implicated in the execution of inflammatory response and pyroptotic death. Although current data are associated NLRP1 genetic variants with AD, the involvement of NLRP1 inflammasome in AD pathogenesis is still unknown. Using APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, we found that cerebral NLRP1 levels were upregulated. Our in vitro studies further showed that increased NLRP1-mediated caspase-1-dependent 'pyroptosis' in cultured cortical neurons in response to amyloid-Î². Moreover, we employed direct in vivo infusion of non-viral small-interfering RNA to knockdown NLRP1 or caspase-1 in APPswe/PS1dE9 brain, and discovered that these NLRP1 or caspase-1 deficiency mice resulted in significantly reduced neuronal pyroptosis and reversed cognitive impairments. Taken together, our findings indicate an important role for NLRP1/caspase-1 signaling in AD progression, and point to the modulation of NLRP1 inflammasome as a promising strategy for AD therapy.  
24241689	Cholesterol in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in a birth cohort over 14Â years.
Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 20131117 2014Sep
Animal epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that cholesterol is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the relation of cholesterol to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), influence of APOE genotype and its changes in lifespan is controversial. We investigated the potential impact of plasma total cholesterol (TC) on development of MCI and AD in the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging, a representative birth cohort (born 1930-1932), examined in 1993/1994 (VT1), 1997/1998 (VT2), and 2005/2007 (VT3). Of 500 participants at baseline, 381 survived and were examined at VT3. After exclusion of participants with lifetime prevalence of major psychiatric diseases or mild cognitive disorder due to a medical condition, 222 participants were included in the analysis. At VT3, 82 participants had MCI, 22 participants had AD, and 118 were in good health. Participants with MCI and AD at VT3 evidenced higher TC levels at VT1 than those who were healthy. Higher TC levels at baseline were associated with an increased risk for cognitive disorders at VT3 (highest vs. lowest quartile: OR 2.64, 95Â % CI 1.12-6.23, pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Over the 14Â year follow-up, TC levels declined in those with MCI and AD, but remained stable in those who remained healthy. These findings were not modified by APOE genotype or use of cholesterol-lowering medications. Our findings demonstrate that higher TC levels are observed long before the clinical manifestation of MCI and AD in patients without psychiatric or somatic comorbidities and are independent of APOE genotype.  
24595744	Diffusion tensor imaging in Alzheimer's disease and affective disorders.
Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 20140305 2014Sep
The functional organization of the brain in segregated neuronal networks has become a leading paradigm in the study of brain diseases. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows testing the validity and clinical utility of this paradigm on the structural connectivity level. DTI in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests a selective impairment of intracortical projecting fiber tracts underlying the functional disorganization of neuronal networks supporting memory and other cognitive functions. These findings have already been tested for their utility as clinical markers of AD in large multicenter studies. Affective disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP), show a high comorbidity with AD in geriatric populations and may even have a pathogenetic overlap with AD. DTI studies in MDD and BP are still limited to small-scale monocenter studies, revealing subtle abnormalities in cortico-subcortial networks associated with affect regulation and reward/aversion control. The clinical utility of these findings remains to be further explored. The present paper presents the methodological background of diffusion imaging, including DTI and diffusion spectrum imaging, and discusses key findings in AD and affective disorders. The results of our review strongly point toward the necessity of large-scale multicenter multimodal transnosological networks to study the structural and functional basis of neuronal disconnection underlying different neuropsychiatric diseases.  
25147522	Subclass-based multi-task learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140807 2014
In this work, we propose a novel subclass-based multi-task learning method for feature selection in computer-aided Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnosis. Unlike the previous methods that often assumed a unimodal data distribution, we take into account the underlying multipeak distribution of classes. The rationale for our approach is that it is highly likely for neuroimaging data to have multiple peaks or modes in distribution, e.g., mixture of Gaussians, due to the inter-subject variability. In this regard, we use a clustering method to discover the multipeak distributional characteristics and define subclasses based on the clustering results, in which each cluster covers a peak in the underlying multipeak distribution. Specifically, after performing clustering for each class, we encode the respective subclasses, i.e., clusters, with their unique codes. In encoding, we impose the subclasses of the same original class close to each other and those of different original classes distinct from each other. By setting the codes as new label vectors of our training samples, we formulate a multi-task learning problem in a â„“2,1-penalized regression framework, through which we finally select features for classification. In our experimental results on the ADNI dataset, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by improving the classification accuracies by 1% (AD vs. Normal Control: NC), 3.25% (MCI vs. NC), 5.34% (AD vs. MCI), and 7.4% (MCI Converter: MCI-C vs. MCI Non-Converter: MCI-NC) compared to the competing single-task learning method. It is remarkable for the performance improvement in MCI-C vs. MCI-NC classification, which is the most important for early diagnosis and treatment. It is also noteworthy that with the strategy of modality-adaptive weights by means of a multi-kernel support vector machine, we maximally achieved the classification accuracies of 96.18% (AD vs. NC), 81.45% (MCI vs. NC), 73.21% (AD vs. MCI), and 74.04% (MCI-C vs. MCI-NC), respectively.  
25147748	Differential network analyses of Alzheimer's disease identify early events in Alzheimer's disease pathology.
Int J Alzheimers Dis 20140723 2014
In late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple brain regions are not affected simultaneously. Comparing the gene expression of the affected regions to identify the differences in the biological processes perturbed can lead to greater insight into AD pathogenesis and early characteristics. We identified differentially expressed (DE) genes from single cell microarray data of four AD affected brain regions: entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus (HIP), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). We organized the DE genes in the four brain regions into region-specific gene coexpression networks. Differential neighborhood analyses in the coexpression networks were performed to identify genes with low topological overlap (TO) of their direct neighbors. The low TO genes were used to characterize the biological differences between two regions. Our analyses show that increased oxidative stress, along with alterations in lipid metabolism in neurons, may be some of the very early events occurring in AD pathology. Cellular defense mechanisms try to intervene but fail, finally resulting in AD pathology as the disease progresses. Furthermore, disease annotation of the low TO genes in two independent protein interaction networks has resulted in association between cancer, diabetes, renal diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.  
25144755	Famous landmark identification in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140821 2014
Identification of famous landmarks (FLI), famous faces (FFI) and recognition of facial emotions (FER) is affected early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). FFI, FER and FLI may represent domain specific tasks relying on activation of distinct regions of the medial temporal lobe, which are affected successively during the course of AD. However, the data on FFI and FER in MCI are controversial and FLI domain remains almost unexplored. To determine whether and how are these three specific domains impaired in head to head comparison of patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) single domain (SD-aMCI) and multiple domain (MD-aMCI). We propose that FLI might be most reliable in differentiating SD-aMCI, which is considered to be an earlier stage of AD pathology spread out, from the controls. A total of 114 patients, 13 with single domain (SD-aMCI) and 30 with multiple domains (MD-aMCI), 29 with mild AD and 42 controls underwent standard neurological and neuropsychological evaluations as well as tests of FLI, FER and FFI. Compared to the control group, AD subjects performed worse on FFI (pâ€Š=â€Š0.020), FER (p&lt;0.001) and FLI (p&lt;0.001), MD-aMCI group had significantly worse scores only on FLI (pâ€Š=â€Š0.002) and approached statistical significance on FER (0.053). SD-aMCI group performed significantly worse only on FLI (pâ€Š=â€Š0.028) compared to controls. Patients with SD-aMCI had an isolated impairment restricted to FLI, while patients with MD-aMCI showed impairment in FLI as well as in FER. Patients with mild dementia due to AD have more extensive impairment of higher visual perception. The results suggest that FLI testing may contribute to identification of patients at risk of AD. We hypothesize that clinical examination of all three domains might reflect the spread of the disease from transentorhinal cortex, over amygdala to fusiform gyrus. 
24725293	Association study of TREM2 polymorphism rs75932628 with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han population.
Neurol. Res. 20140413 2014Oct
We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether TREM2 polymorphism (rs75932628-T) was associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Southern Han population. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was performed to genotype rs75932628 in 279 cases with late onset Alzheimer's diseases patients and 346 control subjects in Shanghai and Nanjing. There was no rs75932628-T variant detected in our sample. However, APOEÏµ4 was shown closely associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (Chi-squareâ€Š=â€Š60Â·288, Pâ€Š=â€Š0Â·000). Our study suggested that TREM2 (rs75932628-T) was rare in Chinese Han population. Further association studies with large samples are needed to further study the association of TREM2 with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. 
25140532	An efficient approach for differentiating Alzheimer's disease from normal elderly based on multicenter MRI using gray-level invariant features.
PLoS ONE 20140820 2014
Machine learning techniques, along with imaging markers extracted from structural magnetic resonance images, have been shown to increase the accuracy to differentiate patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from normal elderly controls. Several forms of anatomical features, such as cortical volume, shape, and thickness, have demonstrated discriminative capability. These approaches rely on accurate non-linear image transformation, which could invite several nuisance factors, such as dependency on transformation parameters and the degree of anatomical abnormality, and an unpredictable influence of residual registration errors. In this study, we tested a simple method to extract disease-related anatomical features, which is suitable for initial stratification of the heterogeneous patient populations often encountered in clinical data. The method employed gray-level invariant features, which were extracted from linearly transformed images, to characterize AD-specific anatomical features. The intensity information from a disease-specific spatial masking, which was linearly registered to each patient, was used to capture the anatomical features. We implemented a two-step feature selection for anatomic recognition. First, a statistic-based feature selection was implemented to extract AD-related anatomical features while excluding non-significant features. Then, seven knowledge-based ROIs were used to capture the local discriminative powers of selected voxels within areas that were sensitive to AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The discriminative capability of the proposed feature was measured by its performance in differentiating AD or MCI from normal elderly controls (NC) using a support vector machine. The statistic-based feature selection, together with the knowledge-based masks, provided a promising solution for capturing anatomical features of the brain efficiently. For the analysis of clinical populations, which are inherently heterogeneous, this approach could stratify the large amount of data rapidly and could be combined with more detailed subsequent analyses based on non-linear transformation.  
25140899	Deciphering the glycolipid code of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's amyloid proteins allowed the creation of a universal ganglioside-binding Peptide.
PLoS ONE 20140820 2014
A broad range of microbial and amyloid proteins interact with cell surface glycolipids which behave as infectivity and/or toxicity cofactors in human pathologies. Here we have deciphered the biochemical code that determines the glycolipid-binding specificity of two major amyloid proteins, Alzheimer's Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²) and Parkinson's disease associated protein Î±-synuclein. We showed that both proteins interact with selected glycolipids through a common loop-shaped motif exhibiting little sequence homology. This 12-residue domain corresponded to fragments 34-45 of Î±-synuclein and 5-16 of AÎ². By modulating the amino acid sequence of Î±-synuclein at only two positions in which we introduced a pair of histidine residues found in AÎ², we created a chimeric Î±-synuclein/AÎ² peptide with extended ganglioside-binding properties. This chimeric peptide retained the property of Î±-synuclein to recognize GM3, and acquired the capacity to recognize GM1 (an AÎ²-inherited characteristic). Free histidine (but not tryptophan or asparagine) and Zn2+ (but not Na+) prevented this interaction, confirming the key role of His-13 and His-14 in ganglioside binding. Molecular dynamics studies suggested that the chimeric peptide recognized cholesterol-constrained conformers of GM1, including typical chalice-shaped dimers, that are representative of the condensed cholesterol-ganglioside complexes found in lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane of neural cells. Correspondingly, the peptide had a particular affinity for raft-like membranes containing both GM1 and cholesterol. The chimeric peptide also interacted with several other gangliosides, including major brain gangliosides (GM4, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b) but not with neutral glycolipids such as GlcCer, LacCer or asialo-GM1. It could inhibit the binding of AÎ²1-42 onto neural SH-SY5Y cells and did not induce toxicity in these cells. In conclusion, deciphering the glycolipid code of amyloid proteins allowed us to create a universal ganglioside-binding peptide of only 12-residues with potential therapeutic applications in infectious and neurodegenerative diseases that involve cell surface gangliosides as receptors.  
25141174	Molecular investigations of protriptyline as a multi-target directed ligand in Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140820 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving multiple cellular and molecular processes. The discovery of drug molecules capable of targeting multiple factors involved in AD pathogenesis would greatly facilitate in improving therapeutic strategies. The repositioning of existing non-toxic drugs could dramatically reduce the time and costs involved in developmental and clinical trial stages. In this study, preliminary screening of 140 FDA approved nervous system drugs by docking suggested the viability of the tricyclic group of antidepressants against three major AD targets, viz. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Î²-secretase (BACE-1), and amyloid Î² (AÎ²) aggregation, with one member, protriptyline, showing highest inhibitory activity. Detailed biophysical assays, together with isothermal calorimetry, fluorescence quenching experiments, kinetic studies and atomic force microscopy established the strong inhibitory activity of protriptyline against all three major targets. The molecular basis of inhibition was supported with comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations. Further, the drug inhibited glycation induced amyloid aggregation, another important causal factor in AD progression. This study has led to the discovery of protriptyline as a potent multi target directed ligand and established its viability as a promising candidate for AD treatment.  
25141298	Predicting progression of Alzheimer's disease using ordinal regression.
PLoS ONE 20140820 2014
We propose a novel approach to predicting disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) - multivariate ordinal regression - which inherently models the ordered nature of brain atrophy spanning normal aging (CTL) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Ordinal regression provides probabilistic class predictions as well as a continuous index of disease progression - the ORCHID (Ordinal Regression Characteristic Index of Dementia) score. We applied ordinal regression to 1023 baseline structural MRI scans from two studies: the US-based Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the European based AddNeuroMed program. Here, the acquired AddNeuroMed dataset was used as a completely independent test set for the ordinal regression model trained on the ADNI cohort providing an optimal assessment of model generalizability. Distinguishing CTL-like (CTL and stable MCI) from AD-like (MCI converters and AD) resulted in balanced accuracies of 82% (cross-validation) for ADNI and 79% (independent test set) for AddNeuroMed. For prediction of conversion from MCI to AD, balanced accuracies of 70% (AUC of 0.75) and 75% (AUC of 0.81) were achieved. The ORCHID score was computed for all subjects. We showed that this measure significantly correlated with MMSE at 12 months (Ï?â€Š=â€Š-0.64, ADNI and Ï?â€Š=â€Š-0.59, AddNeuroMed). Additionally, the ORCHID score can help fractionate subjects with unstable diagnoses (e.g. reverters and healthy controls who later progressed to MCI), moderately late converters (12-24 months) and late converters (24-36 months). A comparison with results in the literature and direct comparison with a binary classifier suggests that the performance of this framework is highly competitive.  
23954849	Intra-hippocampal transplantation of neural precursor cells with transgenic over-expression of IL-1 receptor antagonist rescues memory and neurogenesis impairments in an Alzheimer's disease model.
Neuropsychopharmacology 20130819 2014Jan
Ample evidence implicates neuroinflammatory processes in the etiology and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To assess the specific role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) in AD we examined the effects of intra-hippocampal transplantation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) with transgenic over-expression of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1raTG) on memory functioning and neurogenesis in a murine model of AD (Tg2576 mice). WT NPCs- or sham-transplanted Tg2576 mice, as well as naive Tg2576 and WT mice served as controls. To assess the net effect of IL-1 blockade (not in the context of NPCs transplantation), we also examined the effects of chronic (4 weeks) intra-cerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of IL-1ra. We report that 12-month-old Tg2576 mice exhibited increased mRNA expression of hippocampal IL-1Î², along with severe disturbances in hippocampal-dependent contextual and spatial memory as well as in neurogenesis. Transplantation of IL-1raTG NPCs 1 month before the neurobehavioral testing completely rescued these disturbances and significantly increased the number of endogenous hippocampal cells expressing the plasticity-related molecule BDNF. Similar, but less-robust effects were also produced by transplantation of WT NPCs and by i.c.v. IL-1ra administration. NPCs transplantation produced alterations in hippocampal plaque formation and microglial status, which were not clearly correlated with the cognitive effects of this procedure. The results indicate that elevated levels of hippocampal IL-1 are causally related to some AD-associated memory disturbances, and provide the first example for the potential use of genetically manipulated NPCs with anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of AD.  
23715750	Effects of triptolide on degeneration of dendritic spines induced by AÎ²1-40 injection in rat hippocampus.
Neurol. Sci. 20130529 2014Jan
Although the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive, mounting evidence continues to support the involvement of neuroinflammation in the development of AD. Triptolide isolated from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. In this study, we observed the effects of triptolide on dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons in model rats with AD. Thirty male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, AD model group and triptolide-treated group. The AD model group was made with bilateral microinjection of aggregated beta-amyloid protein (AÎ²)1-40 into hippocampus in rats and the control group rats were injected with normal saline in the same way. The triptolide-treated group rats were administered triptolide intraperitoneally for 30 days after microinjection of aggregated AÎ²1-40 into hippocampus. Dendritic morphology of hippocampal neurons in each group was analyzed using Golgi staining and ImageJ software. Our data showed that the total number of intersection points of dendrites and spine density in hippocampal neurons in the AD model group were decreased as compared with the control group. However, the total number of intersection points of dendrites and spine density in hippocampal neurons in the triptolide-treated group were increased as compared with the AD model group. Our results indicate that triptolide can alleviate the degeneration of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons in model rats with AD.

Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 20131127 2014Feb
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of noncoding RNAs,âˆ¼ 20 - 22 nucleotides in length, that repress target gene expression through mRNA degradation and translation inhibition. The gene encoding miR-323-3p, which is a biomarker in immune and inflammatory responses, exists in a miRNA cluster in chromosomal region 14q32.31. It has been shown that miR-323-3p associates with the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and ectopic pregnancy. This review provides a current view on the association of miR-323-3p with several human diseases and is focused on the recent studies of miR-323-3p regulation, discussing its potential as an epigenetic biomarker and therapeutic target for these diseases. In particular, the mechanisms of miR-323-3p in these diseases and how miR-323-3p is regulated are also discussed. Although the exact role of miR-323-3p in these diseases has not been fully elucidated, targeting miR-323-3p may serve as a promising therapy strategy. 
24549157	Wnt signaling in the nervous system and in Alzheimer's disease.
J Mol Cell Biol  2014Feb
Wnts comprise a large family of proteins that have shown to be part of a signaling cascade that regulates several aspects of development including organogenesis, midbrain development as well as stem cell proliferation. Wnt signaling pathway plays different roles in the development of neuronal circuits and also in the adult brain, where it regulates synaptic transmission and plasticity. It has been also implicated in various diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, reflecting its relevance in fundamental biological processes. This review summarizes the progress about Wnts function in mature nervous system with a focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD). We discuss the prospects of modulating canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling as a strategy for neuroprotection. This will include the potential of Wnts to: (i) act as potent regulators of hippocampal synapses and impact in learning and memory; (ii) regulate adult neurogenesis; and finally (iii) control AD pathogenesis.  
24904272	GSK-3Î², a pivotal kinase in Alzheimer disease.
Front Mol Neurosci 20140521 2014
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia. The etiology of AD is considered to be multifactorial as only a negligible percentage of cases have a familial or genetic origin. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is regarded as a critical molecular link between the two histopathological hallmarks of the disease, namely senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this review, we summarize current data regarding the involvement of this kinase in several aspects of AD development and progression, as well as key observations highlighting GSK-3 as one of the most relevant targets for AD treatment.  
24816337	Structural connectivity of the default mode network and cognition in Alzheimer×³s disease.
Psychiatry Res 20140424 2014Jul30
Disconnectivity between the Default Mode Network (DMN) nodes can cause clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer×³s disease (AD). We aimed to examine the structural connectivity between DMN nodes, to verify the extent in which white matter disconnection affects cognitive performance. MRI data of 76 subjects (25 mild AD, 21 amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects and 30 controls) were acquired on a 3.0T scanner. ExploreDTI software (fractional Anisotropy threshold=0.25 and the angular threshold=60Â°) calculated axial, radial, and mean diffusivities, fractional anisotropy and streamline count. AD patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (P=0.01) and streamline count (P=0.029), and higher radial diffusivity (P=0.014) than controls in the cingulum. After correction for white matter atrophy, only fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity remained significantly lower in AD compared to controls (P=0.003 and P=0.05). In the parahippocampal bundle, AD patients had lower mean and radial diffusivities (P=0.048 and P=0.013) compared to controls, from which only radial diffusivity survived for white matter adjustment (P=0.05). Regression models revealed that cognitive performance is also accounted for by white matter microstructural values. Structural connectivity within the DMN is important to the execution of high-complexity tasks, probably due to its relevant role in the integration of the network.  
24819306	Decrease of event-related delta oscillations in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder.
Psychiatry Res 20140413 2014Jul30
Decreased delta oscillation upon cognitive load is common in patients with Alzheimer×³s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia. However, there is no previous study analyzing the delta responses in euthymic medication-free patients with bipolar disorder. Participants comprised of 22 euthymic medication-free patients with DSM-IV diagnoses of bipolar disorder and 21 healthy controls who were matched to the patients for sex, age, and education. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded at 30 electrode sites using an application of an auditory oddball paradigm. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each subject×³s averaged delta response (0.5-3.5Hz) were measured. There was a significant inter-group difference in evoked and event-related delta (0.5-3.5Hz) responses. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the event-related delta oscillatory responses of the bipolar patient group were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group over the temporo-parietal and occipital electrode sites. Euthymic bipolar patients showed reduced event-related delta oscillatory responses in comparison to healthy subjects under cognitive load. The decrease of delta oscillations may be a common phenomenon that can be observed in different neuropsychiatric disorders with cognitive dysfunction.  
24998828	[Alzheimer's disease: a type of cerebral amyloidosis].
Brain Nerve  2014Jul
Alzheimer's disease is a slowly progressive dementia that is characterized by AÎ² amyloid aggregation, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal death. The major clinical symptoms are memory disturbance, aphasia, visuospatial disturbance, disturbance of executive function, and behavioral changes. Diagnosis is defined by the presence of dementia, the exclusion of non-Alzheimer type dementia, progressive atrophy of the hippocampus and temporoparietal cortex, decreased blood flow and glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, decreased levels of AÎ²42, and increased levels of tau in the cerebrospinal fluid accompanied by positive amyloid proton emission tomography. The development of disease modifying drugs is desired. 
24946259	A Bayesian network decision model for supporting the diagnosis of dementia, Alzheimer×³s disease and mild cognitive impairment.
Comput. Biol. Med. 20140528 2014Aug
Population aging has been occurring as a global phenomenon with heterogeneous consequences in both developed and developing countries. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer×³s Disease (AD), have high prevalence in the elderly population. Early diagnosis of this type of disease allows early treatment and improves patient quality of life. This paper proposes a Bayesian network decision model for supporting diagnosis of dementia, AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Bayesian networks are well-suited for representing uncertainty and causality, which are both present in clinical domains. The proposed Bayesian network was modeled using a combination of expert knowledge and data-oriented modeling. The network structure was built based on current diagnostic criteria and input from physicians who are experts in this domain. The network parameters were estimated using a supervised learning algorithm from a dataset of real clinical cases. The dataset contains data from patients and normal controls from the Duke University Medical Center (Washington, USA) and the Center for Alzheimer×³s Disease and Related Disorders (at the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The dataset attributes consist of predisposal factors, neuropsychological test results, patient demographic data, symptoms and signs. The decision model was evaluated using quantitative methods and a sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the proposed Bayesian network showed better results for diagnosis of dementia, AD and MCI when compared to most of the other well-known classifiers. Moreover, it provides additional useful information to physicians, such as the contribution of certain factors to diagnosis.  
25014050	Elman neural network for the early identification of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
Funct. Neurol.  2014 Jan-Mar
Early detection of dementia can be useful to delay progression of the disease and to raise awareness of the condition. Alterations in temporal and spatial EEG markers have been found in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Herein, we propose an automatic recognition method of cognitive impairment evaluation based on EEG analysis using an artificial neural network (ANN) combined with a genetic algorithm (GA). The EEGs of 43 AD and MCI patients (aged between 62 and 88 years) were recorded, analyzed and correlated with their MMSE scores. Quantitative EEGs were calculated using discrete wavelet transform. The data obtained were analyzed by the means of the combined use of ANN and GA to determine the degree of cognitive impairment. The good recognition rate of ANN fed with these inputs suggests that the combined GA/ANN approach may be useful for early detection of AD and could be a valuable tool to support physicians in clinical practice.  
24343520	Choroid plexus implants rescue Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies by modulating amyloid-Î² degradation.
Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 20131217 2014Aug
The choroid plexuses (CP) release numerous biologically active enzymes and neurotrophic factors, and contain a subpopulation of neural progenitor cells providing the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into other types of cells. These characteristics make CP epithelial cells (CPECs) excellent candidates for cell therapy aiming at restoring brain tissue in neurodegenerative illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, using in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that CP were able to diminish amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) levels in cell cultures, reducing AÎ²-induced neurotoxicity. For in vivo studies, CPECs were transplanted into the brain of the APP/PS1 murine model of AD that exhibits advanced AÎ² accumulation and memory impairment. Brain examination after cell implantation revealed a significant reduction in brain AÎ² deposits, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and astrocytic reactivity. Remarkably, the transplantation of CPECs was accompanied by a total behavioral recovery in APP/PS1 mice, improving spatial and non-spatial memory. These findings reinforce the neuroprotective potential of CPECs and the use of cell therapies as useful tools in AD.  
25012616	Therapeutic perspectives of drugs targeting toll-like receptors based on immune physiopathology theory of Alzheimer's disease.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with the development of dementia. It has been established that the pathological hallmarks of neurofibrillary tau protein tangles and senile Î²-amyloid protein plaques lead to degeneration of neurons via inflammatory pathways. The progressive death of neurons, primarily cholinergic, results in a gradual and fatal decline of cognitive abilities and memory. By targeting these pathological hallmarks and their associated pathways, AD drug therapy can potentially attenuate the disease state. In this review article, we focus on newly proposed and experimental AD drug treatment. We discuss three characteristic areas of AD treatment: prevention of neurotoxic Î²-amyloid protein plaque formation, stability of neuronal tau proteins, and increase in neuronal growth and function. The primary drug therapy methods and patents discussed include the use of neurotrophic factors and targeting of the amyloid precursor protein cleavage pathway as prevention of Î²-amyloid formation and tau aggregation.  
25062863	The co-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease: a neuropathological study of 15 elderly Huntington's disease subjects.
J Huntingtons Dis  2014
Dementia is a common feature in both Huntington's disease (HD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as in the general elderly population. Few studies have examined elderly HD patients with dementia for neuropathologic evidence of both HD and AD. We present neuropathological findings in a retrospective case series of 15 elderly HD patients (ages 60-91 years), 11 of whom had prominent clinical dementia. Post-mortem brain tissue was examined and stained for evidence of both HD and AD including Vonsattel grading and Htt-repeat expansion, Bielskowsky, tau, Î² amyloid, and TDP43 immunostaining. Mean age at death was 76.8 years, mean disease duration was 18.6 years, and mean CAG repeat expansion was 42. Evidence of AD in addition to HD pathology was present in 9 of 11 (82%) patients with prominent dementia, suggesting that AD may be more commonly co-occurring with HD than previously appreciated. Two patients had only HD as the basis of dementia and four patients did not have prominent dementia. One patient with marked parkinsonian features was not L-dopa responsive and had no substantia nigra Lewy bodies at autopsy. Our study suggests that AD may frequently contribute to cognitive decline in elderly HD patients which complicates the assessment and management of such individuals. Further study is needed to determine if there is a higher incidence of AD in persons with HD compared to the general population. In addition, our series includes one HD patient whose clinical features masqueraded as Parkinson's disease but was not responsive to levodopa therapy. 
25108425	Vascular and parenchymal amyloid pathology in an Alzheimer disease knock-in mouse model: interplay with cerebral blood flow.
Mol Neurodegener 20140809 2014
Accumulation and deposition of Î²-amyloid peptides (AÎ²) in the brain is a central event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides the parenchymal pathology, AÎ² is known to undergo active transport across the blood-brain barrier and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a prominent feature in the majority of AD. Although impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been implicated in faulty AÎ² transport and clearance, and cerebral hypoperfusion can exist in the pre-clinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is still unclear whether it is one of the causal factors for AD pathogenesis, or an early consequence of a multi-factor condition that would lead to AD at late stage. To study the potential interaction between faulty CBF and amyloid accumulation in clinical-relevant situation, we generated a new amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-in allele that expresses humanized AÎ² and a Dutch mutation in addition to Swedish/London mutations and compared this line with an equivalent knock-in line but in the absence of the Dutch mutation, both crossed onto the PS1M146V knock-in background. Introduction of the Dutch mutation results in robust CAA and parenchymal AÎ² pathology, age-dependent reduction of spatial learning and memory deficits, and CBF reduction as detected by fMRI. Direct manipulation of CBF by transverse aortic constriction surgery on the left common carotid artery caused differential changes in CBF in the anterior and middle region of the cortex, where it is reduced on the left side and increased on the right side. However these perturbations in CBF resulted in the same effect: both significantly exacerbate CAA and amyloid pathology. Our study reveals a direct and positive link between vascular and parenchymal AÎ²; both can be modulated by CBF. The new APP knock-in mouse model recapitulates many symptoms of AD including progressive vascular and parenchymal AÎ² pathology and behavioral deficits in the absence of APP overexpression. 
25126942	Thermodynamics of the Interaction between Alzheimer's Disease Related Tau Protein and DNA.
PLoS ONE 20140815 2014
Tau hyperphosphorylation can be considered as one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and other tauophaties. Besides its well-known role as a microtubule associated protein, Tau displays a key function as a protector of genomic integrity in stress situations. Phosphorylation has been proven to regulate multiple processes including nuclear translocation of Tau. In this contribution, we are addressing the physicochemical nature of DNA-Tau interaction including the plausible influence of phosphorylation. By means of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) we measured the equilibrium constant and the free energy, enthalpy and entropy changes associated to the Tau-DNA complex formation. Our results show that unphosphorylated Tau binding to DNA is reversible. This fact is in agreement with the protective role attributed to nuclear Tau, which stops binding to DNA once the insult is over. According to our thermodynamic data, oscillations in the concentration of dephosphorylated Tau available to DNA must be the variable determining the extent of Tau binding and DNA protection. In addition, thermodynamics of the interaction suggest that hydrophobicity must represent an important contribution to the stability of the Tau-DNA complex. SPR results together with those from Tau expression in HEK cells show that phosphorylation induces changes in Tau protein which prevent it from binding to DNA. The phosphorylation-dependent regulation of DNA binding is analogous to the Tau-microtubules binding inhibition induced by phosphorylation. Our results suggest that hydrophobicity may control Tau location and DNA interaction and that impairment of this Tau-DNA interaction, due to Tau hyperphosphorylation, could contribute to Alzheimer's pathogenesis.  
25127241	Integrating transcriptomics with metabolic modeling predicts biomarkers and drug targets for Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140815 2014
Accumulating evidence links numerous abnormalities in cerebral metabolism with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), beginning in its early stages. Here, we integrate transcriptomic data from AD patients with a genome-scale computational human metabolic model to characterize the altered metabolism in AD, and employ state-of-the-art metabolic modelling methods to predict metabolic biomarkers and drug targets in AD. The metabolic descriptions derived are first tested and validated on a large scale versus existing AD proteomics and metabolomics data. Our analysis shows a significant decrease in the activity of several key metabolic pathways, including the carnitine shuttle, folate metabolism and mitochondrial transport. We predict several metabolic biomarkers of AD progression in the blood and the CSF, including succinate and prostaglandin D2. Vitamin D and steroid metabolism pathways are enriched with predicted drug targets that could mitigate the metabolic alterations observed. Taken together, this study provides the first network wide view of the metabolic alterations associated with AD progression. Most importantly, it offers a cohort of new metabolic leads for the diagnosis of AD and its treatment.  
24825313	Discovery of 5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-3-oxo-pentanoic Acid [2-(5-Methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-amide as a Neuroprotectant for Alzheimer's Disease by Hybridization of Curcumin and Melatonin.
ACS Chem Neurosci 20140522 2014Aug20
In our effort to develop effective neuroprotectants as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), hybrid compounds of curcumin and melatonin, two natural products that have been extensively studied in various AD models, were designed, synthesized, and biologically characterized. A lead hybrid compound (7) was discovered to show significant neuroprotection with nanomolar potency (EC50 = 27.60 Â± 9.4 nM) in MC65 cells, a cellular AD model. Multiple in vitro assay results established that 7 exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on the production of amyloid-Î² oligomers (AÎ²Os) in MC65 cells, but not on the aggregation of AÎ² species. It also exhibited significant antioxidative properties. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that 7's antioxidant effects correlate well with its neuroprotective potency for MC65 cells, and these effects might be due to its interference with the interactions of AÎ²Os within the mitochondria of MC65 cells. Furthermore, 7 was confirmed to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver a sufficient amount to brain tissue after oral administration. Collectively, these results strongly support the hybridization approach as an efficient strategy to help identify novel scaffolds with a desired pharmacology, and strongly encourage further optimization of 7 to develop more potent neuroprotectants for AD.  
25142294	Charting the decline in spontaneous writing in Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal study.
Acta Neuropsychiatr  2014Aug
This study aims to document the nature and progression of the spontaneous writing impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) over a 12-month period using both a cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal design. Thirty-one minimal-moderate AD patients and 30 controls matched for age and socio-cultural background completed a simple and complex written description task at baseline. The AD patients then had follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months. Cross-sectional comparisons indicated that minimal-moderate AD patients produced more semantic paraphasias, phonological paraphasias, and empty and indefinite phrases, whilst producing fewer pictorial themes, repairing fewer errors, and producing shorter and less complex sentences than controls. The two groups could not be distinguished on visual paraphasias. Longitudinal follow-up, however, suggested that visual processing deteriorates over time, where the prevalence of visual errors increased over 12 months. Discussion The findings suggest that the deterioration of writing skills observed in the spontaneous writings of AD patients shows a pattern of impairment dominated by semantic errors with a secondary impairment in phonological processing, which is later joined by a disruption of visuospatial and graphomotor processing. 
24852682	Cerebrospinal fluid Î²-amyloid and phospho-tau biomarker interactions affecting brain structure in preclinical Alzheimer disease.
Ann. Neurol. 20140613 2014Aug
To assess the relationships between core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and cortical thickness (CTh) in preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). In this cross-sectional study, normal controls (nâ€‰=â€‰145) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent structural 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture. CSF Î²-amyloid1-42 (AÎ²) and phospho-tau181p (p-tau) levels were measured by Luminex assays. Samples were dichotomized using published cutoffs (AÎ²(+) /AÎ²(-) and p-tau(+) /ptau(-) ). CTh was measured by Freesurfer. CTh difference maps were derived from interaction and correlation analyses. Clusters from the interaction analysis were isolated to analyze the directionality of the interaction by analysis of covariance. We found a significant biomarker interaction between CSF AÎ² and CSF p-tau levels affecting brain structure. Cortical atrophy only occurs in subjects with both AÎ²(+) and p-tau(+) . The stratified correlation analyses showed that the relationship between p-tau and CTh is modified by AÎ² status and the relationship between AÎ² and CTh is modified by p-tau status. p-Tau-dependent thinning was found in different cortical regions in AÎ²(+) subjects but not in AÎ²(-) subjects. Cortical thickening was related to decreasing CSF AÎ² values in the absence of abnormal p-tau, but no correlations were found in p-tau(+) subjects. Our data suggest that interactions between biomarkers in AD result in a 2-phase phenomenon of pathological cortical thickening associated with low CSF AÎ², followed by atrophy once CSF p-tau becomes abnormal. These interactions should be considered in clinical trials in preclinical AD, both when selecting patients and when using MRI as a surrogate marker of efficacy. Ann Neurol 2014;76:223-230. 
24933580	Frontoparietal cognitive control of verbal memory recall in Alzheimer's disease.
Ann. Neurol. 20140702 2014Aug
Episodic memory retrieval is reliant upon cognitive control systems, of which 2 have been identified with functional neuroimaging: a cingulo-opercular salience network (SN) and a frontoparietal executive network (EN). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathology is distributed throughout higher-order cortices. The hypotheses were that this frontoparietal pathology would impair activity associated with verbal memory recall; and that central cholinesterase inhibition (ChI) would modulate this, improving memory recall. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study normal participants and 2 patient groups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Activity within the EN and SN was observed during free recall of previously heard sentences, and related to measures of recall accuracy. In normal subjects, trials with reduced recall were associated with greater activity in both the SN and EN. Better recall was associated with greater activity in medial regions of the default mode network. By comparison, AD patients showed attenuated responses in both the SN and EN compared with either controls or MCI patients, even after recall performance was matched between groups. Following ChI, AD patients showed no modulation of activity within the SN, but increased activity within the EN. There was also enhanced activity within regions associated with episodic and semantic memory during less successful recall, requiring greater cognitive control. The results indicate that in AD, impaired responses of cognitive control networks during verbal memory recall are partly responsible for reduced recall performance. One action of symptom-modifying treatment is partially to reverse the abnormal function of frontoparietal cognitive control and temporal lobe memory networks. Ann Neurol 2014;76:241-251.

24549548	Effect of citalopram on agitation in Alzheimer disease: the CitAD randomized clinical trial.
JAMA  2014Feb19
Agitation is common, persistent, and associated with adverse consequences for patients with Alzheimer disease. Pharmacological treatment options, including antipsychotics are not satisfactory. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram for agitation in patients with Alzheimer disease. Key secondary objectives examined effects of citalopram on function, caregiver distress, safety, cognitive safety, and tolerability. The Citalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer Disease Study (CitAD) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial that enrolled 186 patients with probable Alzheimer disease and clinically significant agitation from 8 academic centers in the United States and Canada from August 2009 to January 2013. Participants (nâ€‰=â€‰186) were randomized to receive a psychosocial intervention plus either citalopram (nâ€‰=â€‰94) or placebo (nâ€‰=â€‰92) for 9 weeks. Dosage began at 10 mg per day with planned titration to 30 mg per day over 3 weeks based on response and tolerability. Primary outcome measures were based on scores from the 18-point Neurobehavioral Rating Scale agitation subscale (NBRS-A) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC). Other outcomes were based on scores from the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs), caregiver distress, cognitive safety (based on scores from the 30-point Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]), and adverse events. Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement compared with those who received placebo on both primary outcome measures. The NBRS-A estimated treatment difference at week 9 (citalopram minus placebo) was -0.93 (95% CI, -1.80 to -0.06), Pâ€‰=â€‰.04. Results from the mADCS-CGIC showed 40% of citalopram participants having moderate or marked improvement from baseline compared with 26% of placebo recipients, with estimated treatment effect (odds ratio [OR] of being at or better than a given CGIC category) of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.23-3.69), Pâ€‰=â€‰.01. Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement on the CMAI, total NPI, and caregiver distress scores but not on the NPI agitation subscale, ADLs, or in less use of rescue lorazepam. Worsening of cognition (-1.05 points; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.13; Pâ€‰=â€‰.03) and QT interval prolongation (18.1 ms; 95% CI, 6.1-30.1; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01) were seen in the citalopram group. Among patients with probable Alzheimer disease and agitation who were receiving psychosocial intervention, the addition of citalopram compared with placebo significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress; however, cognitive and cardiac adverse effects of citalopram may limit its practical application at the dosage of 30 mg per day. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00898807. 
24259517	Unraveling the complexity of neurodegeneration in brains of subjects with Down syndrome: insights from proteomics.
Proteomics Clin Appl  2014Feb
Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common genetic causes of intellectual disability characterized by multiple pathological phenotypes, among which neurodegeneration is a key feature. The neuropathology of DS is complex and likely results from impaired mitochondrial function, increased oxidative stress, and altered proteostasis. After the age of 40 years, many (most) DS individuals develop a type of dementia that closely resembles that of Alzheimer's disease with deposition of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A number of studies demonstrated that increased oxidative damage, accumulation of damaged/misfolded protein aggregates, and dysfunction of intracellular degradative systems are critical events in the neurodegenerative processes. This review summarizes the current knowledge that demonstrates a â€œchronicâ€? condition of oxidative stress in DS pointing to the putative molecular pathways that could contribute to accelerate cognition and memory decline. Proteomics and redox proteomics studies are powerful tools to unravel the complexity of DS phenotypes, by allowing to identifying protein expression changes and oxidative PTMs that are proved to be detrimental for protein function. It is reasonable to suggest that changes in the cellular redox status in DS neurons, early from the fetal period, could provide a fertile environment upon which increased aging favors neurodegeneration. Thus, after a critical age, DS neuropathology can be considered a human model of early Alzheimer's disease and could contribute to understanding the overlapping mechanisms that lead from normal aging to development of dementia.

24853936	The intersection of amyloid beta and tau at synapses in Alzheimer's disease.
Neuron  2014May21
The collapse of neural networks important for memory and cognition, including death of neurons and degeneration of synapses, causes the debilitating dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We suggest that synaptic changes are central to the disease process. Amyloid beta and tau form fibrillar lesions that are the classical hallmarks of AD. Recent data indicate that both molecules may have normal roles at the synapse, and that the accumulation of soluble toxic forms of the proteins at the synapse may be on the critical path to neurodegeneration. Further, the march of neurofibrillary tangles through brain circuits appears to take advantage of recently described mechanisms of transsynaptic spread of pathological forms of tau. These two key phenomena, synapse loss and the spread of pathology through the brain via synapses, make it critical to understand the physiological and pathological roles of amyloid beta and tau at the synapse.  
24821909	A novel AÎ²-fibrinogen interaction inhibitor rescues altered thrombosis and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease mice.
J. Exp. Med. 20140512 2014Jun2
Many Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suffer from cerebrovascular abnormalities such as altered cerebral blood flow and cerebral microinfarcts. Recently, fibrinogen has been identified as a strong cerebrovascular risk factor in AD, as it specifically binds to Î²-amyloid (AÎ²), thereby altering fibrin clot structure and delaying clot degradation. To determine if the AÎ²-fibrinogen interaction could be targeted as a potential new treatment for AD, we designed a high-throughput screen and identified RU-505 as an effective inhibitor of the AÎ²-fibrinogen interaction. RU-505 restored AÎ²-induced altered fibrin clot formation and degradation in vitro and inhibited vessel occlusion in AD transgenic mice. Furthermore, long-term treatment of RU-505 significantly reduced vascular amyloid deposition and microgliosis in the cortex and improved cognitive impairment in mouse models of AD. Our studies suggest that inhibitors targeting the AÎ²-fibrinogen interaction show promise as therapy for treating AD.  
24294985	Medicinal chemistry of inhibitors of 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11Î²-HSD1).
J. Med. Chem. 20131213 2014Jun12
11Î²-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11Î²-HSD1) is the enzyme primarily responsible for the regulation of intracellular cortisol levels. Inhibition of 11Î²-HSD1 is an attractive mechanism for the treatment of obesity and other elements of the metabolic syndrome. Emerging literature also supports a potential role in the treatment of other unmet medical needs including Alzheimer's disease, vascular inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and glaucoma.

24874542	Interleukin-1Î² mediated amyloid plaque clearance is independent of CCR2 signaling in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20140527 2014Sep
Neuroinflammation is a key component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Particularly, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²) is upregulated in human AD and believed to promote amyloid plaque deposition. However, studies from our laboratory have shown that chronic IL-1Î² overexpression in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD ameliorates amyloid pathology, increases plaque-associated microglia, and induces recruitment of peripheral immune cells to the brain parenchyma. To investigate the contribution of CCR2 signaling in IL-1Î²-mediated amyloid plaque clearance, seven month-old APP/PS1/CCR2(-/-) mice were intrahippocampally transduced with a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 containing the cleaved form of human IL-1Î² (rAAV2-IL-1Î²). Four weeks after rAAV2-IL-1Î² transduction, we found significant reductions in 6E10 and Congo red staining of amyloid plaques that was confirmed by decreased levels of insoluble AÎ²1-42 and AÎ²1-40 in the inflamed hippocampus. Bone marrow chimeric studies confirmed the presence of infiltrating immune cells following IL-1Î² overexpression and revealed that dramatic reduction of CCR2(+) peripheral mononuclear cell recruitment to the inflamed hippocampus did not prevent the ability of IL-1Î² to induce amyloid plaque clearance. These results suggest that infiltrating CCR2(+) monocytes do not contribute to IL-1Î²-mediated amyloid plaque clearance.  
24892886	RanBP9 overexpression accelerates loss of dendritic spines in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20140602 2014Sep
We previously demonstrated that RanBP9 overexpression increased AÎ² generation and amyloid plaque burden, subsequently leading to robust reductions in the levels of several synaptic proteins as well as deficits in the learning and memory skills in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we found striking reduction of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta (52%, p&lt;0.001) and spinophilin area (62.5%, p&lt;0.001) in the primary cortical neurons derived from RanBP9 transgenic mice (RanBP9-Tg) compared to wild-type (WT) neurons. Similar results were confirmed in WT cortical neurons transfected with EGFP-RanBP9. At 6-months of age, the total spine density in the cortex of RanBP9 single transgenic, APÎ”E9 double transgenic and APÎ”E9/RanBP9 triple transgenic mice was similar to WT mice. However, in the hippocampus the spine density was significantly reduced (27%, p&lt;0.05) in the triple transgenic mice compared to WT mice due to reduced number of thin spines (33%, p&lt;0.05) and mushroom spines (22%, p&lt;0.05). This suggests that RanBP9 overexpression in the APÎ”E9 mice accelerates loss of spines and that the hippocampus is more vulnerable. At 12-months of age, the cortex showed significant reductions in total spine density in the RanBP9 (22%, p&lt;0.05), APÎ”E9 (19%, p&lt;0.05) and APÎ”E9/RanBP9 (33%, p&lt;0.01) mice compared to WT controls due to reductions in mushroom and thin spines. Similarly, in the hippocampus the total spine density was reduced in the RanBP9 (23%, p&lt;0.05), APÎ”E9 (26%, p&lt;0.05) and APÎ”E9/RanBP9 (39%, p&lt;0.01) mice due to reductions in thin and mushroom spines. Most importantly, RanBP9 overexpression in the APÎ”E9 mice further exacerbated the reductions in spine density in both the cortex (14%, p&lt;0.05) and the hippocampus (16%, p&lt;0.05). Because dendritic spines are considered physical traces of memory, loss of spines due to RanBP9 provided the physical basis for the learning and memory deficits. Since RanBP9 protein levels are increased in AD brains, RanBP9 might play a crucial role in the loss of spines and synapses in AD.  
24909617	Regional upregulation of hippocampal melatonin MT2 receptors by valproic acid: therapeutic implications for Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140605 2014Jul25
We have reported that clinically relevant concentrations of valproic acid (VPA) upregulate the G protein-coupled melatonin MT1 receptor in rat C6 glioma cells, and both MT1 and MT2 receptors in the rat hippocampus. The melatonin MT2 receptor is relatively enriched in the hippocampus, where it is thought to be involved in modulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Importantly, a significant decrease in MT2 expression has been observed in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's patients. Therefore, we examined whether the global upregulation of this receptor (and also the MT1) by VPA, observed in earlier RT-PCR and real time PCR studies, could be localized to more discrete hippocampal regions, which are involved in cognitive function. In situ hybridization of rat brain slices, following chronic VPA treatment (3mg/mL or 4mg/mL in drinking water), revealed a significant upregulation of the MT2 receptor mRNA in the CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the rat hippocampus. In contrast, the MT1 receptor was not detected in the hippocampus by in situ hybridization. The significant induction of melatonin MT2 receptor expression by VPA in hippocampal regions involved in learning, memory and/or neural stem cell proliferation, suggests that a combinatorial therapeutic strategy involving VPA together with melatonin or other MT2 agonists, would be beneficial in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.  
25001114	Using U.S. Medicare records to evaluate the indirect health effects on spouses: a case study in Alzheimer's disease patients.
BMC Health Serv Res 20140707 2014
The burden experienced by spouses of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may have negative consequences for their physical health. We describe here a method for analyzing United States Medicare records to determine the changes in health service use and costs experienced by spouses after their marital partner receives an AD diagnosis. We initially identified all beneficiaries in the 2001-2005 Medicare 5% sample who had multiple claims listing the ICD-9 diagnostic code for AD, 331.0. The 5% sample includes spouses who share a Medicare account with their marital partners because they lack a sufficient work history for full eligibility on their own. A matched cohort study assessed incremental health costs in the spouses of AD patients versus a control group of spouses of non-AD patients. Longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses tracked the impact of a patient's AD diagnosis on his or her spouse's healthcare costs. Our method located 54,593 AD patients of whom 11.5% had spouses identifiable via a shared Medicare account. AD diagnosis in one member of a couple was associated with significantly higher monthly Medicare payments for the other member's healthcare. The spouses' elevated costs commenced 2 to 3 months before their partners' AD diagnosis and persisted over the follow-up period. After 31 months, the cumulative additional Medicare reimbursements totaled a mean $4,600 in the spouses of AD patients. This excess was significant even after accounting for differences in baseline health status between the cohorts. The study methodology provides a framework for comprehensively evaluating medical costs of both chronically ill patients and their spouses. This method also provides monthly data, which makes possible a longitudinal evaluation of the cost effects of specific health events. The observed correlations provide a coherent demonstration of the interdependence between AD patients' and spouses' health. Future research should examine caregiving burden and other possible factors contributing to the AD spouses' health outcomes. It should also extend the method presented here to evaluations of other chronic diseases of the elderly. 
24968859	Reversal by aqueous extracts of Cistanche tubulosa from behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease-like rat model: relevance for amyloid deposition and central neurotransmitter function.
BMC Complement Altern Med 20140626 2014
Cistanche tubulosa (Schenk) R. Wight (CT) is commonly used to treat forgetfulness by traditional Chinese physicians. This study presents the ameliorating effects of CT extract which was quantified with three phenylpropanoid glycosides in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like rat model. Amyloid Î² peptide 1-42 (AÎ² 1-42) intracisternally infused to rats by osmotic pump (Alzet 2002) was used as an AD-like rat model. The major pathological makers were measured including AÎ² 1-42 immunohistochemical stain, behavioral tests (inhibitory avoidance task and Morris water maze) and central neurotransmitter functions. AÎ² 1-42 caused the cognitive deficits, the increase in the amyloid deposition and acetylcholinesterase activities, and the decrease in the levels of brain's acetylcholine and dopamine. Daily administration of CT extract throughout AÎ² 1-42 infusion periods ameliorated the cognitive deficits, decreased amyloid deposition and reversed cholinergic and hippocampal dopaminergic dysfunction caused by AÎ² 1-42. Donepezil also ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction, but only blocked the amyloid deposition and cholinergic dysfunction caused by AÎ² 1-42. We suggest that CT extract, containing enough echinacoside and acteoside, ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction caused by AÎ² 1-42 via blocking amyloid deposition, reversing cholinergic and hippocampal dopaminergic neuronal function. 
25072319	Women with the Alzheimer's risk marker ApoE4 lose AÎ²-specific CD4(+) T cells 10-20 years before men.
Transl Psychiatry 20140729 2014
Adaptive immunity to self-antigens causes autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and type 1 diabetes; paradoxically, T- and B-cell responses to amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) reduce Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated pathology and cognitive impairment in mouse models of the disease. The manipulation of adaptive immunity has been a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD, although vaccine and anti-AÎ² antibody approaches have proven difficult in patients, thus far. CD4(+) T cells have a central role in regulating adaptive immune responses to antigens, and AÎ²-specific CD4(+) T cells have been shown to reduce AD pathology in mouse models. As these cells may facilitate endogenous mechanisms that counter AD, an evaluation of their abundance before and during AD could provide important insights. AÎ²-CD4see is a new assay developed to quantify AÎ²-specific CD4(+) T cells in human blood, using dendritic cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells. In tests of &gt;50 human subjects AÎ²-CD4see showed an age-dependent decline of AÎ²-specific CD4(+) T cells, which occurs earlier in women than men. In aggregate, men showed a 50% decline in these cells by the age of 70 years, but women reached the same level before the age of 60 years. Notably, women who carried the AD risk marker apolipoproteinE-É›4 (ApoE4) showed the earliest decline, with a precipitous drop between 45 and 52 years, when menopause typically begins. AÎ²-CD4see requires a standard blood draw and provides a minimally invasive approach for assessing changes in AÎ² biology that may reveal AD-related changes in physiology by a decade. Furthermore, CD4see probes can be modified to target any peptide, providing a powerful new tool to isolate antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells from human subjects.  
25086961	Prediction of miRNA-mRNA associations in Alzheimer's disease mice using network topology.
BMC Genomics 20140803 2014
Little is known about the relationship between miRNA and mRNA expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) at early- or late-symptomatic stages. Sequence-based target prediction algorithms and anti-correlation profiles have been applied to predict miRNA targets using omics data, but this approach often leads to false positive predictions. Here, we applied the joint profiling analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression levels to Tg6799 AD model mice at 4 and 8Â months of age using a network topology-based method. We constructed gene regulatory networks and used the PageRank algorithm to predict significant interactions between miRNA and mRNA. In total, 8 cluster modules were predicted by the transcriptome data for co-expression networks of AD pathology. In total, 54 miRNAs were identified as being differentially expressed in AD. Among these, 50 significant miRNA-mRNA interactions were predicted by integrating sequence target prediction, expression analysis, and the PageRank algorithm. We identified a set of miRNA-mRNA interactions that were changed in the hippocampus of Tg6799 AD model mice. We determined the expression levels of several candidate genes and miRNA. For functional validation in primary cultured neurons from Tg6799 mice (MT) and littermate (LM) controls, the overexpression of ARRDC3 enhanced PPP1R3C expression. ARRDC3 overexpression showed the tendency to decrease the expression of miR139-5p and miR3470a in both LM and MT primary cells. Pathological environment created by AÎ² treatment increased the gene expression of PPP1R3C and Sfpq but did not significantly alter the expression of miR139-5p or miR3470a. AÎ² treatment increased the promoter activity of ARRDC3 gene in LM primary cells but not in MT primary cells. Our results demonstrate AD-specific changes in the miRNA regulatory system as well as the relationship between the expression levels of miRNAs and their targets in the hippocampus of Tg6799 mice. These data help further our understanding of the function and mechanism of various miRNAs and their target genes in the molecular pathology of AD. 
25012223	Perforant path synaptic loss correlates with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the oldest-old.
Brain 20140709 2014Sep
Alzheimer's disease, which is defined pathologically by abundant amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles concurrent with synaptic and neuronal loss, is the most common underlying cause of dementia in the elderly. Among the oldest-old, those aged 90 and older, other ageing-related brain pathologies are prevalent in addition to Alzheimer's disease, including cerebrovascular disease and hippocampal sclerosis. Although definite Alzheimer's disease pathology can distinguish dementia from normal individuals, the pathologies underlying cognitive impairment, especially in the oldest-old, remain poorly understood. We therefore conducted studies to determine the relative contributions of Alzheimer's disease pathology, cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal sclerosis and the altered expression of three synaptic proteins to cognitive status and global cognitive function. Relative immunohistochemistry intensity measures were obtained for synaptophysin, Synaptic vesicle transporter Sv2 (now known as SV2A) and Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 in the outer molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus on the first 157 participants of 'The 90+ Study' who came to autopsy, including participants with dementia (n = 84), those with cognitive impairment but no dementia (n = 37) and those with normal cognition (n = 36). Thal phase, Braak stage, cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal sclerosis and Pathological 43-kDa transactive response sequence DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) were also analysed. All measures were obtained blind to cognitive diagnosis. Global cognition was tested by the Mini-Mental State Examinaton. Logistic regression analysis explored the association between the pathological measures and the odds of being in the different cognitive groups whereas multiple regression analyses explored the association between pathological measures and global cognition scores. No measure clearly distinguished the control and cognitive impairment groups. Comparing the cognitive impairment and dementia groups, synaptophysin and SV2 were reduced, whereas Braak stage, TDP-43 and hippocampal sclerosis frequency increased. Thal phase and VGLUT1 did not distinguish the cognitive impairment and dementia groups. All measures distinguished the dementia and control groups and all markers associated with the cognitive test scores. When all markers were analysed simultaneously, a reduction in synaptophysin, a high Braak stage and the presence of TDP-43 and hippocampal sclerosis associated with global cognitive function. These findings suggest that tangle pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43 and perforant pathway synaptic loss are the major contributors to dementia in the oldest-old. Although an increase in plaque pathology and glutamatergic synaptic loss may be early events associated with cognitive impairment, we conclude that those with cognitive impairment, but no dementia, are indistinguishable from cognitively normal subjects based on the measures reported here.  
25012224	A data-driven model of biomarker changes in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
Brain 20140709 2014Sep
We demonstrate the use of a probabilistic generative model to explore the biomarker changes occurring as Alzheimer's disease develops and progresses. We enhanced the recently introduced event-based model for use with a multi-modal sporadic disease data set. This allows us to determine the sequence in which Alzheimer's disease biomarkers become abnormal without reliance on a priori clinical diagnostic information or explicit biomarker cut points. The model also characterizes the uncertainty in the ordering and provides a natural patient staging system. Two hundred and eighty-five subjects (92 cognitively normal, 129 mild cognitive impairment, 64 Alzheimer's disease) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with measurements of 14 Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, regional magnetic resonance imaging brain volume and rates of atrophy measures, and cognitive test scores. We used the event-based model to determine the sequence of biomarker abnormality and its uncertainty in various population subgroups. We used patient stages assigned by the event-based model to discriminate cognitively normal subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment. The model predicts that cerebrospinal fluid levels become abnormal first, followed by rates of atrophy, then cognitive test scores, and finally regional brain volumes. In amyloid-positive (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-Î²1-42 &lt; 192 pg/ml) or APOE-positive (one or more APOE4 alleles) subjects, the model predicts with high confidence that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers become abnormal in a distinct sequence: amyloid-Î²1-42, phosphorylated tau, total tau. However, in the broader population total tau and phosphorylated tau are found to be earlier cerebrospinal fluid markers than amyloid-Î²1-42, albeit with more uncertainty. The model's staging system strongly separates cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease subjects (maximum classification accuracy of 99%), and predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (maximum balanced accuracy of 77% over 3 years), and from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (maximum balanced accuracy of 76% over 5 years). By fitting Cox proportional hazards models, we find that baseline model stage is a significant risk factor for conversion from both mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (P = 2.06 Ã— 10(-7)) and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (P = 0.033). The data-driven model we describe supports hypothetical models of biomarker ordering in amyloid-positive and APOE-positive subjects, but suggests that biomarker ordering in the wider population may diverge from this sequence. The model provides useful disease staging information across the full spectrum of disease progression, from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This approach has broad application across neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into disease biology, as well as staging and prognostication.  
25137962	[Non pharmacological therapies for Alzheimer's].
Soins Gerontol  2014 Jul-Aug
A number of non pharmacological therapies for Alzheimer's disease exist, focusing on cognitive, psycho-social, sensory, physical and environmental aspects. Although their absolute efficacy has not been proven, their results are encouraging. Outpatient therapy to maintain patients' competencies changes how the objectives and methods of patient care are viewed. By establishing individualised, relational care, it aims above all to preserve the patient's quality of life. It recognises the role, contribution and skill of the caregiver. 
24896980	High Affinity Radiopharmaceuticals Based Upon Lansoprazole for PET Imaging of Aggregated Tau in Alzheimer's Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy: Synthesis, Preclinical Evaluation, and Lead Selection.
ACS Chem Neurosci 20140616 2014Aug20
Abnormally aggregated tau is the hallmark pathology of tauopathy neurodegenerative disorders and is a target for development of both diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies across the tauopathy disease spectrum. Development of carbon-11- or fluorine-18-labeled radiotracers with appropriate affinity and specificity for tau would allow noninvasive quantification of tau burden using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. We have synthesized [(18)F]lansoprazole, [(11)C]N-methyl lansoprazole, and [(18)F]N-methyl lansoprazole and identified them as high affinity radiotracers for tau with low to subnanomolar binding affinities. Herein, we report radiosyntheses and extensive preclinical evaluation with the aim of selecting a lead radiotracer for translation into human PET imaging trials. We demonstrate that [(18)F]N-methyl lansoprazole, on account of the favorable half-life of fluorine-18 and its rapid brain entry in nonhuman primates, favorable kinetics, low white matter binding, and selectivity for binding to tau over amyloid, is the lead compound for progression into clinical trials.  
22760168	Can Mirtazapine Counteract the Weight Loss Associated With Alzheimer Disease? A Retrospective Open-label Study.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jul-Sep
Weight loss is a frequent complication of Alzheimer disease (AD), associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Increased appetite and weight gain are known side effects of the antidepressant mirtazapine. This analysis was undertaken to assess the safety and potential utility of mirtazapine to counteract weight loss in patients with AD or mixed AD (AD with cerebrovascular lesions). We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of all outpatients attending our memory clinic for AD or mixed AD, who had received mirtazapine (30 mg daily) with the specific purpose of inducing weight or appetite gain. Data were available for a total of 22 patients (mean age, 80.9 y, 86.4% female). The mean weight at baseline was 52.4 kg and the mean BMI was 20.5 kg/m. 77.3% of the patients had gained weight after 3 months (mean gain, 1.93 kg or 3.9% of initial body weight) and 82.3% after 6 months (2.11 kg or 4.6%). One patient had to discontinue mirtazapine because of daytime sleepiness. Mirtazapine seems to be a safe and useful approach to counteract weight loss in AD, if possible in combination with nonpharmacological interventions. Body weight should be monitored during treatment to avoid excessive weight gain.  
24077017	Altered Levels of Amyloid Precursor Protein Intracellular Domain-interacting Proteins in Alzheimer Disease.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jul-Sep
The amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) is an intrinsically unstructured molecule with functional promiscuity that plays an important role in determining the fate of the neurons during its degeneration. Its association with Alzheimer disease (AD) recently played a key role in propelling scientists to choose AICD as a major molecule of interest. Although several studies have been conducted elucidating AICD's participation in inducing neurodegenerative outcomes in AD condition, much remains to be deciphered regarding the linkage of AICD with cellular pathways in the AD scenario. In the present study, we have pulled down interactors of nonphosphorylated AICD from the cerebrospinal fluid of AD subjects, identified them by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, and subsequently studied the differential expression of these interactors in AD and control cases by 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. The study has yielded some AICD-interactors that are differentially expressed in the AD cases and are involved in diverse cellular functions. This proteomic-based approach highlights the first step in finding the possible cellular pathways engaged in AD pathophysiology on the basis of interaction of one or more of their members with AICD. 
24614267	Progressive Changes in Hippocampal Resting-state Connectivity Across Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-sectional Study From Normal to Alzheimer Disease.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jul-Sep
We investigate the changes in functional connectivity of the left and right hippocampus by comparing the resting-state low-frequency fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal from these regions with relation to Alzheimer disease (AD) progression. AD patients were divided into subgroups based on the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores. Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) were also analyzed as an intermediate stage between normal controls and AD. We found that the total functional connectivity of both the right and left hippocampus was maintained during aMCI and the early stages of AD and that it decreased in the later stages of AD. However, when total functional connectivity was broken down into specific regions of the brain, we observed increased or decreased connectivity to specific regions beginning with aMCI. Direct correlation analysis in seeding the left hippocampus revealed a significant decrease in the functional connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex region and lateral parietal areas, and an increase in functional connectivity in and the anterior cingulate cortex beginning with aMCI. In this study, we were able to quantify the deterioration of resting-state hippocampal connectivity with disease severity and formation of compensatory recruitment in the early stages of AD.  
24614271	Cognitive behavioral group intervention for Alzheimer caregivers.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jul-Sep
Long-term caregiving of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) frequently induces a relevant distress enhanced by inadequate coping strategies. This study aimed to explore the impact of cognitive and behavioral therapy (CBT) group intervention on AD patients' caregivers. In particular, reduction in caregivers' global care needs and in anxiety and depression has been investigated. About 100 caregivers were divided into the following groups: CBT group intervention, self-help manual, and control have been enrolled in the study. CBT group intervention seems to be more effective than the other 2 conditions in reducing caregivers' anxiety. Furthermore, only caregivers of the CBT group showed significant needs related to reduction in care. The proposed treatment could be the core of a more structured and systematic intervention for AD patients' caregivers in Italy.  
24732302	Correlation between both Morphologic and Functional Changes and Anxiety in Alzheimer's Disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140408 2014
Although anxiety symptoms are often observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), little attention has been paid to this symptom compared with other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Twenty-six patients with mild AD underwent both magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission tomography with technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated using the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (Behave-AD). We investigated the relationship between anxiety and neuroimaging using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 software. The Behave-AD anxiety score was correlated with hyperperfusion in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices and a reduction in the gray matter volume in the right precuneus and inferior parietal lobule. Our results suggest that anxiety in AD could overlap with the neural correlates of anxiety disorders, and that the specific degeneration associated with AD might be associated with anxiety.

24732348	Long-term mortality in a cohort of home-dwelling elderly with mild Alzheimer's disease and lewy body dementia.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140408 2014
To study mortality in subjects with mild dementia in Norway with a special focus on patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD) compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD). All referrals of mild dementia patients to dementia clinics in western Norway from March 2005 to March 2007 were included and followed until December 2012. Diagnoses were based on a comprehensive standardized assessment program. Of 209 patients, 137 (66%) had AD and 53 (25%) had LBD. Dementia was associated with increased mortality (standardized mortality ratio = 1.8, AD 1.5, LBD 2.6). The median survival time was 6.2 years (95% CI 5.4-6.9). Predictors of mortality were age at diagnosis (HR 1.1 per year) and LBD diagnosis (HR 2.4). Dementia patients had an increased mortality, particularly those with LBD. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel. 
24732387	The potentially protective effect of donepezil in Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140409 2014
Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we used a voxel-based specific regional analysis system for AD (VSRAD) to analyze the hippocampal volume and to assess the pharmacologic effects of donepezil as a disease modifier. A total of 185 AD patients underwent MRI, 120 (43 men and 77 women, 77.8 Â± 7.1 years) without and 65 (29 men and 36 women, 78.4 Â± 6.0 years) with donepezil treatment. VSRAD was compared in both groups and against a database of 80 normal subjects. The Z-score was used to assess the degree of hippocampal atrophy. No significant difference between the groups was found for age, sex, or Z-scores, but a significant difference was found for mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p = 0.02, Student's t test). Single regression analysis showed no significant association between Z-scores and MMSE scores in the treated group (p = 0.494), but a significant association in the untreated group (p = 0.001) was observed. This implies that the MMSE score becomes lower when the Z-score is higher in the untreated group, whereas there is no significant trend in the treated group. Donepezil affects the relationship between hippocampal volume and cognitive function and may therefore have a pharmacologic effect as a disease modifier. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel. 
24969517	Is HCRTR2 a Genetic Risk Factor for Alzheimer's Disease?
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140625 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the main types of dementia affecting about 50-55% of all demented patients. Sleep disturbances in AD patients are associated with the severity of dementia and are often the primary reason for institutionalization. These sleep problems partly resemble the core symptoms of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder caused by a general loss of the neurotransmitter hypocretin. The aim of our study was to investigate whether genetic variants in the hypocretin (HCRT) and in the hypocretin receptors 1 and 2 (HCRTR1, HCRTR2) genes could modify the occurrence and the clinical features of AD and to examine if these possible variants influence the role of the protein in sleep regulation. Using a case-control strategy, we genotyped 388 AD patients and 272 controls for 10 SNPs in the HCRT, HCRTR1 and HCRTR2 genes. In order to evaluate which residues belong to the HCRTR2 binding site, we built a molecular model. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs2653349 polymorphism were different (Ï‡(2) = 5.77, p = 0.016; Ï‡(2) = 6.728, p = 0.035) between AD patients and controls. The carriage of the G allele was associated with an increased AD risk (OR 2.53; 95% CI 1.10-5.80). No significant differences were found in the distribution of either genotypic or allelic frequencies between cases and controls in the HCRTR1 polymorphisms rs2271933, rs10914456 and rs4949449 and in the HCRTR2 polymorphism rs3122156. Our data support the hypothesis that the HCRTR2 gene is likely to be a risk factor for AD. The increased risk inferred is quite small, but in the context of a multi-factorial disease, the presence of this polymorphism may significantly contribute to influencing the susceptibility for AD by interacting with other unknown genetic or environmental factors in sleep regulation.

24969819	Motor cortex excitability changes in mild Alzheimer's disease are reversed by donepezil.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140625 2014
Recent neuroimaging studies in humans support the clinical observations that the motor cortex is affected early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure the active cortical motor threshold (ACMT) in AD patients in the very early stage of the disease, and we explored whether and in which way the pharmacologic manipulation of the cholinergic system could have a direct effect on the excitability of the motor cortex. An increase of the ACMT was observed in AD patients in the early stage in comparison to controls. After 2 months of treatment with donepezil, the threshold did not differ significantly from normal subjects. The results suggest an early functional impairment of cholinergic neurotransmission in AD, which is associated to early changes in the excitability of the motor system. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel. 
24989365	Epigenetic drug discovery for Alzheimer's disease.
Expert Opin Drug Discov 20140703 2014Sep
It is assumed that epigenetic modifications are reversible and could potentially be targeted by pharmacological and dietary interventions. Epigenetic drugs are gaining particular interest as potential candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This article covers relevant information from over 50 different epigenetic drugs including: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors; histone deacetylase inhibitors; histone acetyltransferase modulators; histone methyltransferase inhibitors; histone demethylase inhibitors; non-coding RNAs (microRNAs) and dietary regimes. The authors also review the pharmacoepigenomics and the pharmacogenomics of epigenetic drugs. The readers will gain insight into i) the classification of epigenetic drugs; ii) the mechanisms by which these drugs might be useful in AD; iii) the pharmacological properties of selected epigenetic drugs; iv) pharmacoepigenomics and the influence of epigenetic drugs on genes encoding CYP enzymes, transporters and nuclear receptors; and v) the genes associated with the pharmacogenomics of anti-dementia drugs. Epigenetic drugs reverse epigenetic changes in gene expression and might open future avenues in AD therapeutics. Unfortunately, clinical trials with this category of drugs are lacking in AD. The authors highlight the need for pharmacogenetic and pharmacoepigenetic studies to properly evaluate any efficacy and safety issues. 
25062433	Chiral Metallohelical Complexes Enantioselectively Target Amyloid Î² for Treating Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 20140807 2014Aug20
Stereochemistry is a very important issue for the pharmaceutical industry and can determine drug efficacy. The design and synthesis of small molecules, especially chiral molecules, which selectively target and inhibit amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) aggregation, represent valid therapeutic strategies for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein we report that two triple-helical dinuclear metallosupramolecular complexes can act as a novel class of chiral amyloid-Î² inhibitors. Through targeting Î±/Î²-discordant stretches at the early steps of aggregation, these metal complexes can enantioselectively inhibit AÎ² aggregation, which is demonstrated using fluorescent living cell-based screening and multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of enantioselective inhibition of AÎ² aggregation. Intriguingly, as a promising candidate for AD treatment, the chiral metal complex can cross the blood-brain barrier and have superoxide dismutase activity. It is well-known that chiral discrimination is important for understanding chiral drug action. Generally, one enantiomer is pharmaceutically active while the other is inactive or exerts severe side effects. Chiral discrimination should be important for AD treatment. Our work provides new insights into chiral inhibition of AÎ² aggregation and opens a new avenue for design and screening of chiral agents as AÎ² inhibitors against AD.  
24916405	The N-terminal fragment of the Î²-amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease (N-APP) binds to phosphoinositide-rich domains on the surface of hippocampal neurons.
J. Neurosci. Res. 20140611 2014Nov
The function of the Î²-amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. The secreted ectodomain fragment of APP (sAPPÎ±) can be readily cleaved to produce a small N-terminal fragment (N-APP) that contains heparin-binding and metal-binding domains and that has been found to have biological activity. In the present study, we examined whether N-APP can bind to lipids. We found that N-APP binds selectively to phosphoinositides (PIPs) but poorly to most other lipids. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2 )-rich microdomains were identified on the extracellular surface of neurons and glia in primary hippocampal cultures. N-APP bound to neurons and colocalized with PIPs on the cell surface. Furthermore, the binding of N-APP to neurons increased the level of cell-surface PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. However, PIPs were not the principal cell-surface binding site for N-APP, because N-APP binding to neurons was not inhibited by a short-acyl-chain PIP analogue, and N-APP did not bind to glial cells which also possessed PI(4,5)P2 on the cell surface. The data are explained by a model in which N-APP binds to two distinct components on neurons, one of which is an unidentified receptor and the second of which is a PIP lipid, which binds more weakly to a distinct site within N-APP. Our data provide further support for the idea that N-APP may be an important mediator of APP's biological activity. Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  
24158021	Pyroglutamate-Modified Amyloid-Î² Protein Demonstrates Similar Properties in an Alzheimer's Disease Familial Mutant Knock-In Mouse and Alzheimer's Disease Brain.
Neurodegener Dis 20131023 2014
N-terminally truncated, pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides are major constituents of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a newly developed ELISA for AÎ² modified at glutamate 3 with a pyroglutamate (pE3AÎ²), brain pE3AÎ² was characterized in human AD in an AD mouse model harboring double knock-in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-KM670/671NL and presenilin 1 (PS1)-P264L (APP/PS1-dKI) mutations, and in a second mouse model with transgenic overexpression of human APP695 with APP-KM670/671NL (Tg2576). pE3AÎ² increased in the AD brain versus age-matched controls, with pE3AÎ²/total AÎ² at 45 and 10%, respectively. Compared to controls, the AD brain demonstrated 8.5-fold increased pE3AÎ² compared to non-pE3AÎ² species, which increased 2.7-fold. In the APP/PS1-dKI brain, pE3AÎ²/total AÎ² increased from 7% at 3 months to 16 and 19% at 15 and 19 months, respectively. In Tg2576, pE3AÎ²/total AÎ² was only 1.5% at 19 months, suggesting that APP/PS1-dKI, despite less total AÎ² compared to Tg2576 at comparable ages, more closely mimics AD brain pathology. This report supports a significant role for pE3AÎ² in AD pathogenesis by confirming that pE3AÎ² represents a large fraction of AÎ² within the AD brain. Compared to the age-matched control brain, pE3AÎ² increased to a greater extent compared to AÎ² species without this N-terminal modification. Further, the APP/PS1-dKI model more closely resembles the AD brain in this regard, compared to the Tg2576 model. Â© 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel. 
24992945	Exploring Alzheimer Molecular Pathology in Down's Syndrome Cerebrospinal Fluid.
Neurodegener Dis 20140627 2014
Individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) develop early Alzheimer's disease (AD) with Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaque pathology. The extra amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene copy in DS is believed to result in a 50% increase in AÎ² production, but it is unclear how this relates to the development of other AD hallmarks, including axonal degeneration and microglia cell activation, and to other neurological problems in DS, including disturbed sleep regulation. To evaluate if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for cerebral amyloidosis, axonal degeneration, microglial activation and sleep regulation were altered in young and old patients with DS, and if these biomarkers were related to altered AÎ² and APP metabolism, reflected by CSF levels of different AÎ² and APP peptides. CSF from DS patients (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 20) were analyzed for AÎ² peptides (AÎ²1-42, AÎ²X-38/40/42), secreted APP species (sAPPÎ±/Î²), biomarkers for AD-like axonal degeneration [total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau], microglial activation (YKL-40, CC chemokine ligand 2) and orexin-A, which is a peptide involved in sleep regulation. We compared biomarker levels between groups and tested for relations between biomarkers, disease stage and age. Several of the markers were specifically increased in DS, including AÎ²X-40, sAPPÎ± and sAPPÎ². ÎŸrexin-A was significantly decreased in DS and correlated with AÎ² and sAPP. Orexin-A decreased with age in DS, while T-tau and YKL-40 increased with age. Down's patients have increased APP and AÎ² production and increased microglial activation with age. The orexin-A metabolism is disturbed in DS and may be linked to APP and AÎ² production. Biomarker studies of DS may contribute to our understanding of the amyloidogenic and neurodegenerative process in AD. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel. 
24106134	Does an Alzheimer's disease susceptibility gene influence the cognitive effects of cancer therapy?
Pediatr Blood Cancer 20130917 2014Oct
The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE e4 carriers suffer greater morbidity from head trauma, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning, yet possible interactions between APOE genotype and cancer therapy on cognition are unclear. Neuropathological and biomarker studies of young asymptomatic APOE e4 carriers that show elevated neocortical amyloid and medial temporal neurofibrillary tangles and longitudinal neuropsychological studies that show accelerated memory decline beginning around age 55-60 years define preclinical AD and have set the stage for assessing the potential adverse cognitive effects of cancer therapy in APOE e4 carriers.

24290439	A 3D Alzheimer's disease culture model and the induction of P21-activated kinase mediated sensing in iPSC derived neurons.
Biomaterials 20131127 2014Feb
The recent progress in stem cell techniques has broadened the horizon for in vitro disease modeling. For desired in vivo like phenotypes, not only correct cell type specification will be critical, the microenvironmental context will be essential to achieve relevant responses. We demonstrate how a three dimensional (3D) culture of stem cell derived neurons can induce in vivo like responses related to Alzheimer's disease, not recapitulated with conventional 2D cultures. To acquire a neural population of cells we differentiated neurons from neuroepithelial stem cells, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. p21-activated kinase mediated sensing of AÎ² oligomers was only possible in the 3D environment. Further, the 3D phenotype showed clear effects on F-actin associated proteins, connected to the disease processes. We propose that the 3D in vitro model has higher resemblance to the AD pathology than conventional 2D cultures and could be used in further studies of the disease. 
24413756	Luteolin reduces Alzheimer's disease pathologies induced by traumatic brain injury.
Int J Mol Sci 20140109 2014
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs in response to an acute insult to the head and is recognized as a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, recent studies have suggested a pathological overlap between TBI and AD, with both conditions exhibiting amyloid-beta (AÎ²) deposits, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation. Additional studies involving animal models of AD indicate that some AD-related genotypic determinants may be critical factors enhancing temporal and phenotypic symptoms of TBI. Thus in the present study, we examined sub-acute effects of moderate TBI delivered by a gas-driven shock tube device in AÎ² depositing Tg2576 mice. Three days later, significant increases in b-amyloid deposition, glycogen synthase-3 (GSK-3) activation, phospho-tau, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed. Importantly, peripheral treatment with the naturally occurring flavonoid, luteolin, significantly abolished these accelerated pathologies. This study lays the groundwork for a safe and natural compound that could prevent or treat TBI with minimal or no deleterious side effects in combat personnel and others at risk or who have experienced TBI.  
24735871	Gly25-Ser26 amyloid Î²-protein structural isomorphs produce distinct AÎ²42 conformational dynamics and assembly characteristics.
J. Mol. Biol. 20140413 2014Jun26
One of the earliest events in amyloid Î²-protein (AÎ²) self-association is nucleation of AÎ² monomer folding through formation of a turn at Gly25-Lys28. We report here the effects of structural changes at the center of the turn, Gly25-Ser26, on AÎ²42 conformational dynamics and assembly. We used "click peptide" chemistry to quasi-synchronously create AÎ²42 from 26-O-acyliso-AÎ²42 (iAÎ²42) through a pH jump from 3 to 7.4. We also synthesized NÎ±-acetyl-Ser26-iAÎ²42 (Ac-iAÎ²42), which cannot undergo Oâ†’N acyl chemistry, to study the behavior of this ester form of AÎ²42 itself at neutral pH. Data from experiments monitoring increases in Î²-sheet formation (thioflavin T, CD), hydrodynamic radius (RH), scattering intensity (quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy), and extent of oligomerization (ion mobility spectroscopy-mass spectrometry) were quite consistent. A rank order of Ac-iAÎ²42&gt;iAÎ²42&gt;AÎ²42 was observed. Photochemically cross-linked iAÎ²42 displayed an oligomer distribution with a prominent dimer band that was not present with AÎ²42. These dimers also were observed selectively in iAÎ²42 in ion mobility spectrometry experiments. The distinct biophysical behaviors of iAÎ²42 and AÎ²42 appear to be due to the conversion of iAÎ²42 into "pure" AÎ²42 monomer, a nascent form of AÎ²42 that does not comprise the variety of oligomeric and aggregated states present in pre-existent AÎ²42. These results emphasize the importance of the Gly25-Ser26 dipeptide in organizing AÎ²42 monomer structure and thus suggest that drugs altering the interactions of this dipeptide with neighboring side-chain atoms or with the peptide backbone could be useful in therapeutic strategies targeting formation of AÎ² oligomers and higher-order assemblies.  
24823451	Effect of medications on physical function and cognition in nursing home residents with dementia.
J Am Geriatr Soc 20140513 2014Jun
To assess the effectiveness of medications used in the management of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) on cognition and activity of daily living (ADL) trajectories and to determine whether sex modifies these effects. Two-year (2007-2008) longitudinal study. Medicare enrollment and claims data linked to the Minimum Dataset 2.0. Older nursing home (NH) residents with newly diagnosed ADRD (n = 18,950). Exposures included four medication classes: antidementia medications (ADMs), antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers. Outcomes included ADLs and cognition (Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS)). Marginal structural models were employed to account for time-dependent confounding. The mean age was 83.6, and 76% of the sample was female. Baseline use of ADMs was 15%, antidepressants was 40%, antipsychotics was 13%, and mood stabilizers was 3%. Mean baseline ADL and CPS scores were 16.6 and 2.1, respectively. ADM use was not associated with change in ADLs over time but was associated with a slower CPS decline (slope difference: -0.09 points/year, 99% confidence interval (CI) = -0.14 to -0.03). Antidepressant use was associated with slower declines in ADL (slope difference: -0.36 points/year, 99% CI = -0.58 to -0.14) and CPS (slope difference: -0.12 points/year, 99% CI = -0.17 to -0.08). Sex modified the effect of both antipsychotic and mood stabilizer use on ADLs; female users declined most quickly. Antipsychotic use was associated with slower CPS decline (slope difference: -0.11 points/year, 99% CI = -0.17 to -0.06), whereas mood stabilizer use had no effect. Despite the observed statistically significantly slower declines in cognition with ADMs, antidepressants, and antipsychotics and the slower ADL decline found with antidepressants, it is unlikely that these benefits are of clinical significance. 
24890186	Subjective word-finding difficulty reduces engagement in social leisure activities in Alzheimer's disease.
J Am Geriatr Soc 20140602 2014Jun
To assess the influence of subjective word-finding difficulty on degree of engagement in social leisure activities among individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Analysis of data collected from the second cohort of the Multicenter Study of Predictors of Disease Course in Alzheimer's disease. Four study sites in the United States and France. Individuals diagnosed with mild to moderate AD (N = 236). On separate questionnaires, participants were asked to 1) report whether they had trouble finding the right word when speaking (subjective word-finding difficulty) and 2) rate their frequency and enjoyment of social and nonsocial leisure activities. Objective language measures included object naming and verbal fluency. Measures of dependence, depression, cognitive status, age, sex, and education were also included as covariates in regression analyses. Fifty-two percent of the sample reported word-finding difficulty, and subjective complaints were correlated with poorer verbal fluency scores. Subjective word-finding difficulty was selectively related to social but not nonsocial activity measures. Endorsers of word-finding difficulty reported less frequency and enjoyment of social leisure activities, controlling for effects of covariates and objective word-finding ability. In contrast, lower engagement in nonsocial activities was associated with older age and higher depression scores but not with word-finding complaints. Caregivers' reports of study participants' activities corroborated these results. Individuals with AD who are aware of increasing word-finding failures are less likely to participate in and enjoy socially oriented leisure activities. This finding may have significant implications for clinical and health outcomes in AD. Failure to evaluate subjective language complaints could result in social withdrawal symptoms, threatening the individual's quality of life and increasing caregiver burden. Reduced social interaction may ultimately exacerbate language symptoms over time. 
24958880	Blockade of EphA4 signaling ameliorates hippocampal synaptic dysfunctions in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 20140623 2014Jul8
Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by cognitive decline, has emerged as a disease of synaptic failure. The present study reveals an unanticipated role of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A4 (EphA4) in mediating hippocampal synaptic dysfunctions in AD and demonstrates that blockade of the ligand-binding domain of EphA4 reverses synaptic impairment in AD mouse models. Enhanced EphA4 signaling was observed in the hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mouse model of AD, whereas soluble amyloid-Î² oligomers (AÎ²), which contribute to synaptic loss in AD, induced EphA4 activation in rat hippocampal slices. EphA4 depletion in the CA1 region or interference with EphA4 function reversed the suppression of hippocampal long-term potentiation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, suggesting that the postsynaptic EphA4 is responsible for mediating synaptic plasticity impairment in AD. Importantly, we identified a small-molecule rhynchophylline as a novel EphA4 inhibitor based on molecular docking studies. Rhynchophylline effectively blocked the EphA4-dependent signaling in hippocampal neurons, and oral administration of rhynchophylline reduced the EphA4 activity effectively in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. More importantly, rhynchophylline administration restored the impaired long-term potentiation in transgenic mouse models of AD. These findings reveal a previously unidentified role of EphA4 in mediating AD-associated synaptic dysfunctions, suggesting that it is a new therapeutic target for this disease.  
24939432	Valproate improves memory deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model: investigation of possible mechanisms of action.
Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 20140618 2014Aug
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very common progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the learning and memory abilities in the brain. Key findings from recent studies of epigenetic mechanisms of memory suggest chromatin remodeling disorders via histone hypoacetylation of the lysine residue contribute to the cognitive impairment in AD. Therefore, the deinhibition of histone acetylation induced by histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors contributes to recovery of learning and memory. We show here that the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate (VPA) potently enhanced long-term recognition memory and spatial learning and memory in AD transgenic mice. Possible mechanisms showed VPA could significantly elevate histone acetylation through HDACs activity inhibition and increase plasticity-associated gene expression within the hippocampi of mice. Our study suggests that VPA, serving as a HDACs inhibitor, can be considered as a potential pharmaceutical agent for the improvement of cognitive function in AD. 
25003233	mNos2 Deletion and Human NOS2 Replacement in Alzheimer Disease Models.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Aug
Understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer disease relies on knowledge of disease onset and the sequence of development of brain pathologies. We present a comprehensive analysis of early and progressive changes in a mouse model that demonstrates a full spectrum of characteristic Alzheimer disease-like pathologies. This model demonstrates an altered immune redox state reminiscent of the human disease and capitalizes on data indicating critical differences between human and mouse immune responses, particularly in nitric oxide levels produced by immune activation of the NOS2 gene. Using the APPSwDI/mNos2 (CVN-AD) mouse strain, we show a sequence of pathologic events leading to neurodegeneration,which include pathologically hyperphosphorylated tau in the perforant pathway at 6 weeks of age progressing to insoluble tau, early appearance of Î²-amyloid peptides in perivascular deposits around blood vessels in brain regions known to be vulnerable to Alzheimer disease, and progression to damage and overt loss in select vulnerable neuronal populations in these regions. The role of species differences between hNOS2 and mNos2 was supported by generating mice in which the human NOS2 gene replaced mNos2. When crossed with CVN-AD mice, pathologic characteristics of this new strain (APPSwDI/HuNOS2/mNos2) mimicked the pathologic phenotypes found in the CVN-AD strain.  
24951474	Neuropsychological changes in asymptomatic persons with Alzheimer disease neuropathology.
Neurology 20140620 2014Jul29
To determine whether asymptomatic persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic change differ in the trajectory of their cognitive performance compared to asymptomatic persons without AD neuropathologic change. Longitudinal performance on standard neuropsychological tests was examined in participants who died within 2 years of their last cognitive assessment and who were never diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating global score of 0 at all assessments). Using cognitive and neuropathologic data collected between 2005 and 2013 from the 34 National Institute on Aging-sponsored Alzheimer's Disease Centers, cognitive trajectories were compared for persons with and without evidence of AD neuropathologic change. We evaluated rates of decline in 4 domains (episodic memory, language, attention/working memory, executive function). The significance of the differences (Î²) in rates of decline was tested using linear regression, adjusting for age, education, sex, and other neuropathologic lesions. Participants who had low to high levels of AD neuropathologic change (n = 131) showed a greater rate of decline on the attention/working memory domain score (Î² = -0.11; 95% confidence interval = -0.19, -0.02; p = 0.02) when compared to 80 participants who died without evidence of AD neuropathologic change. Clinically normal individuals who come to autopsy with AD neuropathologic change exhibit subtle evidence of declining cognitive trajectories for attention/working memory. 
25101236	Inferring changepoint times of medial temporal lobe morphometric change in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroimage Clin 20140421 2014
This paper uses diffeomorphometry methods to quantify the order in which statistically significant morphometric change occurs in three medial temporal lobe regions, the amygdala, entorhinal cortex (ERC), and hippocampus among subjects with symptomatic and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were examined in subjects who were cognitively normal at baseline, some of whom subsequently developed clinical symptoms of AD. The images were mapped to a common template, using shape-based diffeomorphometry. The multidimensional shape markers indexed through the temporal lobe structures were modeled using a changepoint model with explicit parameters, specifying the number of years preceding clinical symptom onset. Our model assumes that the atrophy rate of a considered brain structure increases years before detectable symptoms. The results demonstrate that the atrophy changepoint in the ERC occurs first, indicating significant change 8-10Â years prior to onset, followed by the hippocampus, 2-4Â years prior to onset, followed by the amygdala, 3Â years prior to onset. The ERC is significant bilaterally, in both our local and global measures, with estimates of ERC surface area loss of 2.4% (left side) and 1.6% (right side) annually. The same changepoint model for ERC volume gives 3.0% and 2.7% on the left and right sides, respectively. Understanding the order in which changes in the brain occur during preclinical AD may assist in the design of intervention trials aimed at slowing the evolution of the disease.  
25120476	Systemic inflammation, blood-brain barrier vulnerability and cognitive/non-cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer disease: relevance to pathogenesis and therapy.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140729 2014
The incidence of dementia is increasing at an alarming rate, and has become a major public health concern. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. In addition to classical neuropathological features such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), accumulation of activated immune cells has been documented in the AD brain, suggesting a contribution of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD. Besides cognitive deterioration, non-cognitive symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, depression and psychosis, are often observed in demented patients, including those with AD, and these neuropsychological symptoms place a heavy burden on caregivers. These symptoms often exhibit sudden onset and tend to fluctuate over time, and in many cases, they are triggered by an infection in peripheral organs, suggesting that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these non-cognitive symptoms. However, there is no mechanistic explanation for the relationship between inflammation and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Observations from experimental mouse models indicate that alteration of brain blood vessels, especially blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, may contribute to the relationship. The current review summarizes the results from recent studies on the relationship between inflammation and AD, while focusing on cerebrovascular alterations, which might provide an insight into the pathogenesis of cognitive/non-cognitive symptoms in AD patients and suggest a basis for the development of new therapeutic treatments for these conditions.  
25120480	Graph analysis of verbal fluency test discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and normal elderly controls.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140729 2014
Verbal fluency is the ability to produce a satisfying sequence of spoken words during a given time interval. The core of verbal fluency lies in the capacity to manage the executive aspects of language. The standard scores of the semantic verbal fluency test are broadly used in the neuropsychological assessment of the elderly, and different analytical methods are likely to extract even more information from the data generated in this test. Graph theory, a mathematical approach to analyze relations between items, represents a promising tool to understand a variety of neuropsychological states. This study reports a graph analysis of data generated by the semantic verbal fluency test by cognitively healthy elderly (NC), patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment-subtypes amnestic (aMCI) and amnestic multiple domain (a+mdMCI)-and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sequences of words were represented as a speech graph in which every word corresponded to a node and temporal links between words were represented by directed edges. To characterize the structure of the data we calculated 13 speech graph attributes (SGA). The individuals were compared when divided in three (NC-MCI-AD) and four (NC-aMCI-a+mdMCI-AD) groups. When the three groups were compared, significant differences were found in the standard measure of correct words produced, and three SGA: diameter, average shortest path, and network density. SGA sorted the elderly groups with good specificity and sensitivity. When the four groups were compared, the groups differed significantly in network density, except between the two MCI subtypes and NC and aMCI. The diameter of the network and the average shortest path were significantly different between the NC and AD, and between aMCI and AD. SGA sorted the elderly in their groups with good specificity and sensitivity, performing better than the standard score of the task. These findings provide support for a new methodological frame to assess the strength of semantic memory through the verbal fluency task, with potential to amplify the predictive power of this test. Graph analysis is likely to become clinically relevant in neurology and psychiatry, and may be particularly useful for the differential diagnosis of the elderly.  
25120481	Amylin and its analogs: a friend or foe for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease?
Front Aging Neurosci 20140729 2014
Amylin, a gut-brain axis hormone, and amyloid-beta peptides (AÎ²), a major component of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, share several features, including similar Î²-sheet secondary structures, binding to the same receptor and being degraded by the same protease, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE). However, while amylin readily crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and mediates several activities including improving glucose metabolism, relaxing cerebrovascular structure, modulating inflammatory reaction and perhaps enhancing neural regeneration, AÎ² has no known physiological functions. Thus, abundant AÎ² in the AD brain could block or interfere with the binding of amylin to its receptor and hinder its functions. Recent studies using animal models for AD demonstrate that amylin and its analog reduce the AD pathology in the brain and improve cognitive impairment in AD. Given that, in addition to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, perturbed cerebral glucose metabolism and cerebrovascular damage are the hallmarks of the AD brain, we propose that giving exogenous amylin type peptides have the potential to become a new avenue for the diagnosis and therapeutic of AD. Although amylin's property of self-aggregation may be a limitation to developing it as a therapeutic for AD, its clinical analog, pramlintide containing 3 amino acid differences from amylin, does not aggregate like human amylin, but more potently mediates amylin's activities in the brain. Pramlintide is an effective drug for diabetes with a favorable profile of safety. Thus a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial should be conducted to examine the efficacy of pramlintide for AD. This review summarizes the knowledge and findings on amylin type peptides and discuss pros and cons for their potential for AD.  
25120440	Differential processing of natural scenes in posterior cortical atrophy and in Alzheimer's disease, as measured with a saccade choice task.
Front Integr Neurosci 20140725 2014
Atrophy of the medial temporal lobe structures that support scene perception and the binding of an object to its context (i.e., the hippocampus and the parahippocampal cortex) appears early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few studies have investigated scene perception in people with AD. Here, we assessed the ability to find a target object within a natural scene in people with AD and in people with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA, a variant of AD). Pairs of color photographs were displayed on the left and right of a fixation cross for 1 s. In separate blocks of trials, participants were asked to categorize the target (an animal) by either moving their eyes toward the photograph containing the target (the saccadic choice task) or pressing a key corresponding to the target's location (the manual choice task). Isolated objects and objects within scenes were studied in both tasks. Participants with PCA were more impaired in detection of a target within a scene than participants with AD. The latter's performance pattern was more similar to that of age-matched controls in terms of accuracy, saccade latencies and the benefit gained from contextual information. Participants with PCA benefited less from contextual information in both the saccade and the manual choice tasks-suggesting that people with posterior brain lesions have impairments in figure/ground segregation and are more sensitive to object crowding.  
24815535	Development of a Psychometrically Equivalent Short Form of the Face-Name Associative Memory Exam for use Along the Early Alzheimer's Disease Trajectory.
Clin Neuropsychol 20140512 2014Jul
Neuropsychologists are developing more challenging and specific tests to detect early and subtle changes in cognition related to preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 16-item Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (FNAME-16) is a challenging paired associative memory test able to detect subtle memory changes associated with biomarker evidence of preclinical AD. However, as individuals progress along the AD trajectory, measures that are sensitive at the preclinical stage may become too challenging by the stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Our goal was to develop a modified version of the face-name and face-occupation paired associative memory task (FNAME-12) with fewer stimuli and additional learning trials suitable for use in MCI. We administered the FNAME-12A, an alternate version FNAME 12B, the original FNAME-16, and a series of other neuropsychological measures to 65 clinically normal (CN) older adults (aged 65 to 85) and a subsample characterized by MCI (n = 18). The FNAME-12 exhibited psychometric equivalence with the FNAME-16 (r = .77, p &lt; .001) and was correlated with other measures of episodic and semantic memory. The alternate form, FNAME-12B, was highly correlated with FNAME-12A (r = .76, p &lt; .001). Mean performance on the FNAME 12A, stratified by education, was generated. The task could be completed by our MCI group yet remained challenging in the CN group, providing evidence for its utility along the AD trajectory.  
25126078	Lithium suppresses AÎ² pathology by inhibiting translation in an adult Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140730 2014
The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is age, and changes in the ageing nervous system are likely contributors to AD pathology. Amyloid beta (AÎ²) accumulation, which occurs as a result of the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is thought to initiate the pathogenesis of AD, eventually leading to neuronal cell death. Previously, we developed an adult-onset Drosophila model of AD. Mutant AÎ²42 accumulation led to increased mortality and neuronal dysfunction in the adult flies. Furthermore, we showed that lithium reduced AÎ²42 protein, but not mRNA, and was able to rescue AÎ²42-induced toxicity. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism/s by which lithium modulates AÎ²42 protein levels and AÎ²42 induced toxicity in the fly model. We found that lithium caused a reduction in protein synthesis in Drosophila and hence the level of AÎ²42. At both the low and high doses tested, lithium rescued the locomotory defects induced by AÎ²42, but it rescued lifespan only at lower doses, suggesting that long-term, high-dose lithium treatment may have induced toxicity. Lithium also down-regulated translation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe associated with increased chronological lifespan. Our data highlight a role for lithium and reduced protein synthesis as potential therapeutic targets for AD pathogenesis.  
25126056	Frontiers in therapeutic development of allopregnanolone for Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.
Front Cell Neurosci 20140730 2014
Allopregnanolone (Allo), a neurosteroid, has emerged as a promising promoter of endogenous regeneration in brain. In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, Allo induced neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, white matter generation and cholesterol homeostasis while simultaneously reducing Î²-amyloid and neuroinflammatory burden. Allo activates signaling pathways and gene expression required for regeneration of neural stem cells and their differentiation into neurons. In parallel, Allo activates systems to sustain cholesterol homeostasis and reduce Î²-amyloid generation. To advance Allo into studies for chronic human neurological conditions, we examined translational and clinical parameters: dose, regimen, route, formulation, outcome measures, and safety regulations. A treatment regimen of once per week at sub-sedative doses of Allo was optimal for regeneration and reduction in Alzheimer's pathology. This regimen had a high safety profile following chronic exposure in aged normal and Alzheimer's mice. Formulation of Allo for multiple routes of administration has been developed for both preclinical and clinical testing. Preclinical evidence for therapeutic efficacy of Allo spans multiple neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, Niemann-Pick, diabetic neuropathy, status epilepticus, and traumatic brain injury. To successfully translate Allo as a therapeutic for multiple neurological disorders, it will be necessary to tailor dose and regimen to the targeted therapeutic mechanisms and disease etiology. Treatment paradigms conducted in accelerated disease models in young animals have a low probability of successful translation to chronic diseases in adult and aged humans. Gender, genetic risks, stage and burden of disease are critical determinants of efficacy. This review focuses on recent advances in development of Allo for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that have the potential to accelerate therapeutic translation for multiple unmet neurological needs.  
24933011	Multi-Channel neurodegenerative pattern analysis and its application in Alzheimer's disease characterization.
Comput Med Imaging Graph 20140514 2014Sep
Neuroimaging has played an important role in non-invasive diagnosis and differentiation of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. Various features have been extracted from the neuroimaging data to characterize the disorders, and these features can be roughly divided into global and local features. Recent studies show a tendency of using local features in disease characterization, since they are capable of identifying the subtle disease-specific patterns associated with the effects of the disease on human brain. However, problems arise if the neuroimaging database involved multiple disorders or progressive disorders, as disorders of different types or at different progressive stages might exhibit different degenerative patterns. It is difficult for the researchers to reach consensus on what brain regions could effectively distinguish multiple disorders or multiple progression stages. In this study we proposed a Multi-Channel pattern analysis approach to identify the most discriminative local brain metabolism features for neurodegenerative disorder characterization. We compared our method to global methods and other pattern analysis methods based on clinical expertise or statistics tests. The preliminary results suggested that the proposed Multi-Channel pattern analysis method outperformed other approaches in Alzheimer's disease characterization, and meanwhile provided important insights into the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.  
24852459	Flexible modulation of network connectivity related to cognition in Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroimage 20140520 2014Oct
Functional neuroimaging tools, such as fMRI methods, may elucidate the neural correlates of clinical, behavioral, and cognitive performance. Most functional imaging studies focus on regional task-related activity or resting state connectivity rather than how changes in functional connectivity across conditions and tasks are related to cognitive and behavioral performance. To investigate the promise of characterizing context-dependent connectivity-behavior relationships, this study applies the method of generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) to assess the patterns of associative-memory-related fMRI hippocampal functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with performance on memory and other cognitively demanding neuropsychological tests and clinical measures. Twenty-four subjects with mild AD dementia (ages 54-82, nine females) participated in a face-name paired-associate encoding memory study. Generalized PPI analysis was used to estimate the connectivity between the hippocampus and the whole brain during encoding. The difference in hippocampal-whole brain connectivity between encoding novel and encoding repeated face-name pairs was used in multiple-regression analyses as an independent predictor for 10 behavioral, neuropsychological and clinical tests. The analysis revealed connectivity-behavior relationships that were distributed, dynamically overlapping, and task-specific within and across intrinsic networks; hippocampal-whole brain connectivity-behavior relationships were not isolated to single networks, but spanned multiple brain networks. Importantly, these spatially distributed performance patterns were unique for each measure. In general, out-of-network behavioral associations with encoding novel greater than repeated face-name pairs hippocampal-connectivity were observed in the default-mode network, while correlations with encoding repeated greater than novel face-name pairs hippocampal-connectivity were observed in the executive control network (p&lt;0.05, cluster corrected). Psychophysiological interactions revealed significantly more extensive and robust associations between paired-associate encoding task-dependent hippocampal-whole brain connectivity and performance on memory and behavioral/clinical measures than previously revealed by standard activity-behavior analysis. Compared to resting state and task-activation methods, gPPI analyses may be more sensitive to reveal additional complementary information regarding subtle within- and between-network relations. The patterns of robust correlations between hippocampal-whole brain connectivity and behavioral measures identified here suggest that there are 'coordinated states' in the brain; that the dynamic range of these states is related to behavior and cognition; and that these states can be observed and quantified, even in individuals with mild AD.  
25029558	How Do Membranes Initiate Alzheimer's Disease? Formation of Toxic Amyloid Fibrils by the Amyloid Î²-Protein on Ganglioside Clusters.
Acc. Chem. Res. 20140716 2014Aug19
Conspectus Alzheimer's disease (AD), a severe neurodegenerative disorder, causes more than half of dementia cases. According to the popular "AÎ² hypothesis" to explain the mechanism of this disease, amyloid Î²-peptides (AÎ²) of 39-43 amino acid residues aggregate and deposit onto neurons, igniting the neurotoxic cascade of the disease. Therefore, researchers studying AD would like to elucidate the mechanisms by which essentially water-soluble but hydrophobic AÎ² aggregates under pathological conditions. Most researchers have investigated the aggregation of AÎ² in aqueous solution, and they concluded that the final aggregation product, the amyloid fibrils, were less toxic than the component peptide oligomers. They consequently shifted their interests to more toxic "soluble oligomers", structures that form as intermediates or off-pathway products during the aggregation process. Some researchers have also investigated artificial oligomers prepared under nonphysiological conditions. In contrast to these "in solution" studies, we have focused on "membrane-mediated" amyloidogenesis. In an earlier study, other researchers identified a specific form of AÎ² that was bound to monosialoganglioside GM1, a sugar lipid, in brains of patients who exhibited the early pathological changes associated with AD. This Account summarizes 15 years of our research on this topic. We have found that AÎ² specifically binds to GM1 that occurs in clusters, but not when it is uniformly distributed. Clustering is facilitated by cholesterol. Upon binding, AÎ² changes its conformation from a random coil to an Î±-helix-rich structure. A CH-Ï€ interaction between the aromatic side chains of AÎ² and carbohydrate moieties appended to GM1 appears to be important for binding. In addition, as AÎ² accumulates and reaches its first threshold concentration (AÎ²/GM1 = âˆ¼0.013), aggregated Î²-sheets of âˆ¼15 molecules appear and coexist with the helical form. However, this Î²-structure is stable and does not form larger aggregates. When the disease progresses further and the AÎ²/GM1 ratio exceeds âˆ¼0.044, the Î²-structure converts to a second Î²-structure that can seed aggregates. The seed recruits monomers from the aqueous phase to form toxic amyloid fibrils that have larger surface hydrophobicity and can contain antiparallel Î²-sheets. In contrast, amyloid fibrils formed in aqueous solution are less toxic and have parallel Î²-sheets. The less polar environments of GM1 clusters play an important role in the formation of these toxic fibrils. Membranes that contain GM1 clusters not only accelerate the aggregation of AÎ² by locally concentrating AÎ² molecules but also generate amyloid fibrils with unique structures and significant cytotoxicity. The inhibition of this aggregation cascade could be a promising strategy for the development of AD-modulating therapies.  
25080056	The Ongoing Search for Small Molecules to Study Metal-Associated Amyloid-Î² Species in Alzheimer's Disease.
Acc. Chem. Res. 20140731 2014Aug19
Conspectus The development of a cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been impeded by an inability to pinpoint the root cause of this disorder. Although numerous potential pathological factors have been indicated, acting either individually or mutually, the molecular mechanisms leading to disease onset and progression have not been clear. Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), generated from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and its aggregated forms, particularly oligomers, are suggested as key pathological features in AD-affected brains. Historically, highly concentrated metals are found colocalized within AÎ² plaques. Metal binding to AÎ² (metal-AÎ²) generates/stabilizes potentially toxic AÎ² oligomers, and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro (redox active metal ions; plausible contribution to oxidative stress). Consequently, clarification of the relationship between AÎ², metal ions, and toxicity, including oxidative stress via metal-AÎ², can lead to a deeper understanding of AD development. To probe the involvement of metal-AÎ² in AD pathogenesis, rationally designed and naturally occurring molecules have been examined as chemical tools to target metal-AÎ² species, modulate the interaction between the metal and AÎ², and subsequently redirect their aggregation into nontoxic, off-pathway unstructured aggregates. These ligands are also capable of attenuating the generation of redox active metal-AÎ²-induced ROS to mitigate oxidative stress. One rational design concept, the incorporation approach, installs a metal binding site into a framework known to interact with AÎ². This approach affords compounds with the simultaneous ability to chelate metal ions and interact with AÎ². Natural products capable of AÎ² interaction have been investigated for their influence on metal-induced AÎ² aggregation and have inspired the construction of synthetic analogues. Systematic studies of these synthetic or natural molecules could uncover relationships between chemical structures, metal/AÎ²/metal-AÎ² interactions, and inhibition of AÎ²/metal-AÎ² reactivity (i.e., aggregation modes of AÎ²/metal-AÎ²; associated ROS production), suggesting mechanisms to refine the design strategy. Interdisciplinary investigations have demonstrated that the designed molecules and natural products control the aggregation pathways of metal-AÎ² species transforming their size/conformation distribution. The aptitude of these molecules to impact metal-AÎ² aggregation pathways, either via inhibition of AÎ² aggregate formation, most importantly of oligomers, or disaggregation of preformed fibrils, could originate from their formation of complexes with metal-AÎ². Potentially, these molecules could direct metal-AÎ² size/conformational states into alternative nontoxic unstructured oligomers, and control the geometry at the AÎ²-ligated metal center for limited ROS formation to lessen the overall toxicity induced by metal-AÎ². Complexation between small molecules and AÎ²/metal-AÎ² has been observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) pointing to molecular level interactions, validating the design strategy. In addition, these molecules exhibit other attractive properties, such as antioxidant capacity, prevention of ROS production, potential blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and reduction of AÎ²-/metal-AÎ²-induced cytotoxicity, making them desirable tools for unraveling AD complexity. In this Account, we summarize the recent development of small molecules, via both rational design and the selection and modification of natural products, as tools for investigating metal-AÎ² complexes, to advance our understanding of their relation to AD pathology.  
24347181	Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Neurol Belg 20131218 2014Sep
To investigate aberrant genome-wide CpG methylation patterns in cortex brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice and as compared to controls, which allows for identification of novel disease-associated genes. This study investigates the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of the cortex from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and control mice using the Roche NimbleGen chip platform. Functional analysis was then conducted by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis system. The methylated DNA fragments in the genome of each sample were enriched by MeDIP and the whole-genome interrogations were hybridized to the Roche NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 3x720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Array that cover 15,980 CpG islands and 20,404 reference gene promoter regions of the entire human genome. Analysis reveals 2346 CpG sites representing 485 unique genes as potentially associated with AD disease status pending confirmation in additional study. At the same time, these hyper-methylated genes display familial aggregation. An impairment of the transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be specific to the AD brain and, particularly, to the early phase of the disease, supporting a role for epigenetic change of TGF-Î²1 in AD pathology. In future research, we will focus on TGF-Î²1, as it appeared to be the most promising candidate for AD.  
24339078	Learning and using technology in intertwined processes: A study of people with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.
Dementia (London) 20130326 2014Sep
People with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease are likely to be challenged by the multitude of everyday technology in today's society. The aim of this study was to explore how they try to prohibit, avoid or solve problems in everyday technology use, maintain skills, and learn to use new technology. To explore how the participants applied and reasoned about using everyday technology in real-life situations interviews were conducted while the participants used their own technology in their homes. Interviews were conducted with 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment (nâ€‰=â€‰10) or Alzheimer's disease (nâ€‰=â€‰10). The analyses were inspired from grounded theory and resulted in one core category and three sub-categories that represent sub-processes in the core. The core finding presents a continuous, intertwined process of learning and using everyday technology, highlighting how the context was interwoven in the processes. The participants used a rich variety of management strategies when approaching technology, including communication with the everyday technologies on different levels. The findings underscore that it is important to support continued use of everyday technology as long as it is valued and relevant to the person with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. The intertwined process of learning and using everyday technology suggests how support could target different sub-processes.  
25059438	The influence of vascular risk factors on cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
Maturitas 20140630 2014Sep
The influence of vascular risk factors (VRFs) on the rate of cognitive decline in patients with established dementia is unclear. This study aims to examine the association between VRFs and the rate of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data were obtained from patients visiting a memory clinic between 2004 and 2012. VRFs were determined at baseline and included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, overweight and smoking. Continuous values of blood pressure, total cholesterol, glucose level and body mass index were also obtained. Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores were obtained at baseline and during follow-up visits. The association between VRFs and the annual change in MMSE scores was analysed with a multivariable linear mixed model adjusted for age, sex and the aforementioned VRFs. From 174 patients (mean age 78.3 years), with a follow-up time up to 5.8 years (mean 1.1 year), in total 447 MMSE scores were obtained. The multivariable analyses showed an association between age as well as systolic blood pressure and a decline in annual rates of change in MMSE scores of -0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.09 to 0.00) and -0.01 (CI: -0.03 to 0.00), respectively. For all other VRFs, including sex, patients did not show a significant difference. This study did not find an association between preventable vascular risk factors and cognitive decline in patients with AD, except for systolic blood pressure. As the association between systolic blood pressure and decline in MMSE was small, clinical relevance may be limited. 
25031286	Cerebral perfusion alterations and cerebral amyloid in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease.
Neurology 20140716 2014Aug19
To evaluate alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin-labeled MRI in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) mutation carriers (MCs) in relation to cerebral amyloid and compared with age-matched healthy controls. Recent work has identified alterations in CBF in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer dementia using MRI. However, similar studies are lacking in ADAD. Subjects with ADAD are generally free of significant vascular disease and offer the opportunity to measure CBF early in the pathologic process before significant symptom onset when unique markers might be identified. Fourteen MCs (presenilin-1 and amyloid beta precursor protein) (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0 = 9, CDR 0.5 = 4, CDR 1 = 1) and 50 controls underwent 3-tesla pulsed arterial spin-labeled MRI. SPM8 was used to test the effect of MC status at the voxel level on CBF before and after controlling for age and CDR. MCs had decreased perfusion in the caudate and inferior striatum bilaterally even after controlling for age and CDR. In MCs, separate areas of decreased CBF were associated with increasing cerebral amyloid and to decreased performance of attention and executive function. Early CBF changes were identified in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic subjects with ADAD, particularly in the anterior striatum. Furthermore, amyloid deposition was associated with decreased CBF in a number of regions including anterior and posterior cortical areas. Both amyloid and decreased CBF were associated with declines primarily in executive cognitive function. 
23996574	The neuroprotection of Rattin against amyloid Î² peptide in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity of rats.
Hippocampus 20130930 2014Jan
Rattin, a specific derivative of humanin in rats, shares the ability with HN to protect neurons against amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptide-induced cellular toxicity. However, it is still unclear whether Rattin can protect against AÎ²-induced deficits in cognition and synaptic plasticity in rats. In the present study, we observed the effects of Rattin and AÎ²31-35 on the spatial reference memory and in vivo hippocampal Long-term potentiation of rats by using Morris water maze test and hippocampal field potential recording. Furthermore, the probable molecular mechanism underlying the neuroprotective roles of Rattin was investigated. We showed that intra-hippocampal injection of Rattin effectively prevented the AÎ²31-35-induced spatial memory deficits and hippocampal LTP suppression in rats; the AÎ²31-35-induced activation of Caspase-3 and inhibition of STAT3 in the hippocampus were also prevented by Rattin treatment. These findings indicate that Rattin treatment can protect spatial memory and synaptic plasticity of rats against AÎ²31-35-induced impairments, and the underlying protective mechanism of Rattin may be involved in STAT3 and Caspases-3 pathways. Therefore, application of Rattin or activation of its signaling pathways in the brain might be beneficial to the prevention of AÎ²-related cognitive deficits. 
24254769	Attenuation of Î²-amyloid-induced tauopathy via activation of CK2Î±/SIRT1: targeting for cilostazol.
J. Neurosci. Res. 20131119 2014Feb
Î²-Amyloid (AÎ²) deposits and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates are the chief hallmarks in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, but the strategies for controlling these pathological events remain elusive. We hypothesized that CK2-coupled SIRT1 activation stimulated by cilostazol suppresses tau acetylation (Ac-tau) and tau phosphorylation (P-tau) by inhibiting activation of P300 and GSK3Î². AÎ² was endogenously overproduced in N2a cells expressing human APP Swedish mutation (N2aSwe) by exposure to medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 hr. Increased AÎ² accumulation was accompanied by increased Ac-tau and P-tau levels. Concomitantly, these cells showed increased P300 and GSK3Î² P-Tyr216 expression; their expressions were significantly reduced by treatment with cilostazol (3-30 Î¼M) and resveratrol (20 Î¼M). Moreover, decreased expression of SIRT1 and its activity by AÎ² were significantly reversed by cilostazol as by resveratrol. In addition, cilostazol strongly stimulated CK2Î± phosphorylation and its activity, and then stimulated SIRT1 phosphorylation. These effects were confirmed by using the pharmacological inhibitors KT5720 (1 Î¼M, PKA inhibitor), TBCA (20 Î¼M, inhibitor of CK2), and sirtinol (20 Î¼M, SIRT1 inhibitor) as well as by SIRT1 gene silencing and overexpression techniques. In conclusion, increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase-linked CK2/SIRT1 expression by cilostazol can be a therapeutic strategy to suppress the tau-related neurodegeneration in the AD brain. 
24265160	Effects of neural stem cells on synaptic proteins and memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurosci. Res. 20131121 2014Feb
Transplanting neural stem cells (NSC) to the damaged brain has been regarded as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition characterized by memory loss. We hypothesized that transplantation of NSC into the hippocampal regions of APPâ€‰+â€‰PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice, a well-established model of AD, would enhance the expression of synaptic proteins, which may be helpful for improving cognitive function. Our results showed that NSC transplantation significantly improved spatial learning and memory function in Tg mice. The results obtained by real-time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses demonstrated that the expression of synaptophysin (SYN) and that of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) in Tg-NSC mice, 8 weeks after transplantation, were significantly improved compared with what was observed in Tg-Veh (control) mice. This finding was confirmed by the increase in the number of synapses in Tg-NSC mice as observed via electron microscopy. Our results suggest that NSC-induced changes can recover memory loss in APPâ€‰+â€‰PS1 transgenic mice, possibly by establishing new neural circuits resulting from the engrafted NSC. 
24273069	Mechanisms and effects of curcumin on spatial learning and memory improvement in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
J. Neurosci. Res. 20131123 2014Feb
Evidence suggests that curcumin, the phytochemical agent in the spice turmeric, might be a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties have been investigated extensively. Studies have also shown that curcumin can reduce amyloid pathology in AD. The underlying mechanism, however, is complex and is still being explored. In this study, we used the APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice, an AD model, to investigate the effects and mechanisms of curcumin in the prevention and treatment of AD. The water maze test indicated that curcumin can improve spatial learning and memory ability in mice. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis were used to test major proteins in Î²-amyloid aggregation, Î²-amyloid production, and Î²-amyloid clearance. Data showed that, 3 months after administration, curcumin treatment reduced AÎ²40 , AÎ²42 , and aggregation of AÎ²-derived diffusible ligands in the mouse hippocampal CA1 area; reduced the expression of the Î³-secretase component presenilin-2; and increased the expression of Î²-amyloid-degrading enzymes, including insulin-degrading enzymes and neprilysin. This evidence suggests that curcumin, as a potential AD therapeutic method, can reduce Î²-amyloid pathological aggregation, possibly through mechanisms that prevent its production by inhibiting presenilin-2 and/or by accelerating its clearance by increasing degrading enzymes such as insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin. 
24332014	High activities of BACE1 in brains with mild cognitive impairment.
Am. J. Pathol.  2014Jan
We recently discovered elevated Î²-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity in brains with sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Moreover, we also found high levels of BACE1 enzymatic activity in the cerebrospinal fluid from patients with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. These results suggest that elevation of BACE1 enzymatic activity may occur early or may contribute to AD. We therefore examined whether BACE1 enzymatic activity was changed in MCI brains. BACE1 activity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± levels were measured by enzymatic assay and ELISA in the temporal cortex from 18 patients with clinically well-characterized AD, 18 patients with MCI, and 18 healthy controls. We found a significant increase in BACE1 activity and protein level in brains of MCI and AD patients. Moreover, increased BACE1 activity correlated with plaque numbers and cognition status. We also found an increase in TNF-Î± in MCI brains. InÂ vitro study revealed that TNF-Î± rather than other cytokines can up-regulate BACE1 protein expression. These findings suggest that BACE1 increase occurs early in MCI and is possibly induced by TNF-Î± and that BACE1 enzymatic activity may be important for conversion of MCI to AD.  
24231553	Impaired hippocampal acetylcholine release parallels spatial memory deficits in Tg2576 mice subjected to basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration.
Brain Res. 20131111 2014Jan16
The Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model Tg2576 overexpresses an AD associated mutant variant of human APP and accumulates amyloid beta (AÎ²) in an age-dependent manner. Using the selective cholinergic immunotoxin mu p75-saporin (SAP), we induced a partial basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration (BFCD) in 3 months old male Tg2576 mice to co-express cholinergic degeneration with AÎ² overexpression as these characteristics constitutes key hallmarks of AD. At 9 months, SAP lesioned Tg2576 mice were cognitively impaired in two spatial paradigms addressing working memory and mid to long-term memory. Conversely, there was no deterioration of cognitive functioning in sham lesioned Tg2576 mice or wild type littermates (wt) receiving the immunotoxin. At 10 months of age, release of acetylcholine (ACh) was addressed by microdialysis in conscious mice. Scopolamine-induced increases in hippocampal ACh efflux was significantly reduced in SAP lesioned Tg2576 mice compared to sham lesioned Tg2576 mice. Intriguingly, there was no significant difference in ACh efflux between wt treatment groups. Following SAP treatment, choline acetyltransferase activity was reduced in the hippocampus and frontal cortex and the reduction was comparable between groups. Our results suggest that partial BFCD acts collectively with increased levels of AÎ² to induce cognitive decline and to compromise cholinergic release. Tg2576 mice with BFCD may constitute a new and suitable AD mouse model to study the interrelations between cholinergic deficits and amsyloid deposition.  
24200521	Nanoparticle-emitted light attenuates amyloid-Î²-induced superoxide and inflammation in astrocytes.
Nanomedicine 20131104 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of age-related death with no effective intervention yet available. Our previous studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in AD cell models by mitigating amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²)-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the penetration depth of light is still the major challenge for implementing LLLT in animal models and in the clinical settings. In this study, we present the potential of applying Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer to Quantum Dots (BRET-Qdots) as an alternative near infrared (NIR) light source for LLLT. Our results show that BRET-Qdot-emitted NIR suppresses AÎ²-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in primary rat astrocytes. These data provide a proof of concept for a nanomedicine platform for LLLT. Low Level Laser Therapy has already been demonstrated to mitigate amyloid-Î² peptide induced oxidative stress and inflammation, a key driver of Alzheimer's disease. The major issue in moving this forward from cell cultures to live animals and potentially to human subjects is light penetration depth. In this novel study, BRET-Qdots were used as an alternative near infrared light source with good efficacy, paving the way to the development of a nanomedicine platform. 
24441878	Age-dependent postoperative cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-related neuropathology in mice.
Sci Rep 20140120 2014
Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is associated with increased cost of care, morbidity, and mortality. However, its pathogenesis remains largely to be determined. Specifically, it is unknown why elderly patients are more likely to develop POCD and whether POCD is dependent on general anesthesia. We therefore set out to investigate the effects of peripheral surgery on the cognition and Alzheimer-related neuropathology in mice with different ages. Abdominal surgery under local anesthesia was established in the mice. The surgery induced post-operative elevation in brain Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) levels and cognitive impairment in the 18 month-old wild-type and 9 month-old Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice, but not the 9 month-old wild-type mice. The AÎ² accumulation likely resulted from elevation of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme and phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2Î±. Î³-Secretase inhibitor compound E ameliorated the surgery-induced brain AÎ² accumulation and cognitive impairment in the 18 month-old mice. These data suggested that the peripheral surgery was able to induce cognitive impairment independent of general anesthesia, and that the combination of peripheral surgery with aging- or Alzheimer gene mutation-associated AÎ² accumulation was needed for the POCD to occur. These findings would likely promote more research to investigate the pathogenesis of POCD.  
23417832	Hierarchical fusion of features and classifier decisions for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
Hum Brain Mapp 20130218 2014Apr
Pattern classification methods have been widely investigated for analysis of brain images to assist the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By considering the nature of pathological changes, a large number of features related to both local brain regions and interbrain regions can be extracted for classification. However, it is challenging to design a single global classifier to integrate all these features for effective classification, due to the issue of small sample size. To this end, we propose a hierarchical ensemble classification method to combine multilevel classifiers by gradually integrating a large number of features from both local brain regions and interbrain regions. Thus, the large-scale classification problem can be divided into a set of small-scale and easier-to-solve problems in a bottom-up and local-to-global fashion, for more accurate classification. To demonstrate its performance, we use the spatially normalized grey matter (GM) of each MR brain image as imaging features. Specifically, we first partition the whole brain image into a number of local brain regions and, for each brain region, we build two low-level classifiers to transform local imaging features and the inter-region correlations into high-level features. Then, we generate multiple high-level classifiers, with each evaluating the high-level features from the respective brain regions. Finally, we combine the outputs of all high-level classifiers for making a final classification. Our method has been evaluated using the baseline MR images of 652 subjects (including 198 AD patients, 225 MCI patients, and 229 normal controls (NC)) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results show that our classification method can achieve the accuracies of 92.0% and 85.3% for classifications of AD versus NC and MCI versus NC, respectively, demonstrating very promising classification performance compared to the state-of-the-art classification methods. 
24703098	Interleukin-23 receptor polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.
J. Neuroimmunol. 20140321 2014Jun15
Inhibition of interleukin-23 (IL-23) signaling was reported to reduce AD pathology, and IL-23 receptor gene (IL23R) which encodes IL-23 receptor may represent a candidate susceptibility gene for AD. Here, we conducted a case-control association study to assess the effect of IL23R genetic polymorphisms on the risk of AD in a Northern Han Chinese population. Two tag functional single polymorphisms (SNPs), rs10889677 and rs1884444 were selected, and their associations with AD risk factors were assessed in 1133 AD patients and 1156 matched controls. Our association analysis showed that C allele of rs10889677 was significantly associated with decreased AD risk even after adjusting for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) É›4 status. The G allele of rs1884444 polymorphism is significantly associated with a higher risk of AD in APOE É›4 carriers. Our results demonstrate that IL23R genetic polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Northern Han Chinese population.  
24270855	OCIAD2 activates Î³-secretase to enhance amyloid Î² production by interacting with nicastrin.
Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 20131124 2014Jul
The gamma (Î³)-secretase holoenzyme is composed of four core proteins and cleaves APP to generate amyloid beta (AÎ²), a key molecule that causes major neurotoxicity during the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, despite its important role in AÎ² production, little is known about the regulation of Î³-secretase. OCIAD2, a novel modulator of Î³-secretase that stimulates AÎ² production, and which was isolated from a genome-wide functional screen using cell-based assays and a cDNA library comprising 6,178 genes. Ectopic expression of OCIAD2 enhanced AÎ² production, while reduction of OCIAD2 expression suppressed it. OCIAD2 expression facilitated the formation of an active Î³-secretase complex and enhanced subcellular localization of the enzyme components to lipid rafts. OCIAD2 interacted with nicastrin to stimulate Î³-secretase activity. OCIAD2 also increased the interaction of nicastrin with C99 and stimulated APP processing via Î³-secretase activation, but did not affect Notch processing. In addition, a cell-permeable Tat-OCIAD2 peptide that interfered with the interaction of OCIAD2 with nicastrin interrupted the Î³-secretase-mediated AICD production. Finally, OCIAD2 expression was significantly elevated in the brain of AD patients and PDAPP mice. This study identifies OCIAD2 as a selective activator of Î³-secretase to increase AÎ² generation.  
25092996	Cognition and dual-task performance in older adults with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Gen Med 20140721 2014
Patients with neurodegenerative diseases usually experience significant functional deficits. Older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may suffer from both motor and cognitive impairments, making them especially vulnerable to poor dual-task performance. To analyze the dual-task cost of walking in subjects with PD and AD exposed to motor and cognitive distracters. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 126 older adults comprising three groups: PD (n=43), AD (n=38), and control (n=45). The subjects were evaluated using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test administered with motor and cognitive distracters. Mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) with cognition as a covariant factor was used to test the possible main effects of dual-task on motion. A 5% threshold for significance was set, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The partial eta square (n(2)p) analysis was included to estimate the magnitude of effect. Examining the effects for dual-task, ANOVA revealed the main effect for groupÃ—task interactions (F=13.09; P=0.001; n(2)p =0.178), for task (F=8.186; P=0.001; n(2)p =0.063) but not for group (F=2.954; P=0.056; n(2)p =0.047). Cognition applied as a covariant factor indicated interference on dual-tasks (F=30.43; P=0.001; n(2)p =0.201). The findings of this study suggest that dual-task interference is a particularly noticeable problem in PD and AD, affecting subjects' ability to appropriately adapt to environmental challenges. 
25093460	Inhibitor of the Tyrosine Phosphatase STEP Reverses Cognitive Deficits in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
PLoS Biol. 20140805 2014Aug
STEP (STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase) is a neuron-specific phosphatase that regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) trafficking, as well as ERK1/2, p38, Fyn, and Pyk2 activity. STEP is overactive in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The increase in STEP activity likely disrupts synaptic function and contributes to the cognitive deficits in AD. AD mice lacking STEP have restored levels of glutamate receptors on synaptosomal membranes and improved cognitive function, results that suggest STEP as a novel therapeutic target for AD. Here we describe the first large-scale effort to identify and characterize small-molecule STEP inhibitors. We identified the benzopentathiepin 8-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4,5-benzopentathiepin-6-amine hydrochloride (known as TC-2153) as an inhibitor of STEP with an IC50 of 24.6 nM. TC-2153 represents a novel class of PTP inhibitors based upon a cyclic polysulfide pharmacophore that forms a reversible covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine in STEP. In cell-based secondary assays, TC-2153 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STEP substrates ERK1/2, Pyk2, and GluN2B, and exhibited no toxicity in cortical cultures. Validation and specificity experiments performed in wild-type (WT) and STEP knockout (KO) cortical cells and in vivo in WT and STEP KO mice suggest specificity of inhibitors towards STEP compared to highly homologous tyrosine phosphatases. Furthermore, TC-2153 improved cognitive function in several cognitive tasks in 6- and 12-mo-old triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice, with no change in beta amyloid and phospho-tau levels.  
25093415	Gray and white matter changes in subjective cognitive impairment, amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a voxel-based analysis study.
PLoS ONE 20140805 2014
Subjective cognitive impairment may be a very early at-risk period of the continuum of dementia. However, it is difficult to discriminate at-risk states from normal aging. Thus, detection of the early pathological changes in the subjective cognitive impairment period is needed. To elucidate these changes, we employed diffusion tensor imaging and volumetry analysis, and compared subjective cognitive impairment with normal, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The subjects in this study were 39 Alzheimer's disease, 43 mild cognitive impairment, 28 subjective cognitive impairment and 41 normal controls. There were no statistically significant differences between the normal control and subjective cognitive impairment groups in all measures. Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment had the same extent of brain atrophy and diffusion changes. These results are consistent with the hypothetical model of the dynamic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.  
25093735	The Mini Mental State Examination at the Time of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Diagnosis, According to Age, Education, Gender and Place of Residence: A Cross-Sectional Study among the French National Alzheimer Database.
PLoS ONE 20140805 2014
was firstly to describe the MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score upon initial diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders among the French population, according to age. Secondly, education, gender and place of residence were studied as factors potentially associated with delayed Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. we conducted a cross sectional analysis of the French National Alzheimer database (BNA). Data from 2008 to 2012 were extracted. Patients were selected at the moment of their first diagnosis of AD (nâ€Š=â€Š39,451). The MMSE score at initial diagnosis dropped significantly with increasing age. The test score increased with the degree of educational background regardless of age. Gender and place of residence were significantly related to the MMSE score, women and persons living in medical institutions having lower MMSE scores under the age of 90 years and at all educational levels. Health care professionals should be aware of these risk factors in order to maximize chances of earliest possible diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. 
25098597	Gas Chromatography Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS)-Based Metabolomics for Comparison of Caffeinated and Decaffeinated Coffee and Its Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.
PLoS ONE 20140806 2014
Findings from epidemiology, preclinical and clinical studies indicate that consumption of coffee could have beneficial effects against dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The benefits appear to come from caffeinated coffee, but not decaffeinated coffee or pure caffeine itself. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use metabolomics approach to delineate the discriminant metabolites between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, which could have contributed to the observed therapeutic benefits. Gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS)-based metabolomics approach was employed to characterize the metabolic differences between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed distinct separation between the two types of coffee (cumulative Q2â€Š=â€Š0.998). A total of 69 discriminant metabolites were identified based on the OPLS-DA model, with 37 and 32 metabolites detected to be higher in caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, respectively. These metabolites include several benzoate and cinnamate-derived phenolic compounds, organic acids, sugar, fatty acids, and amino acids. Our study successfully established GC-TOF-MS based metabolomics approach as a highly robust tool in discriminant analysis between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee samples. Discriminant metabolites identified in this study are biologically relevant and provide valuable insights into therapeutic research of coffee against AD. Our data also hint at possible involvement of gut microbial metabolism to enhance therapeutic potential of coffee components, which represents an interesting area for future research.  
25101829	Neuritin attenuates cognitive function impairments in tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140807 2014
Neuritin, also known as CPG15, is a neurotrophic factor that was initially discovered in a screen to identify genes involved in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Neuritin plays multiple roles in the process of neural development and synaptic plasticity, although its binding receptor(s) and downstream signaling effectors remain unclear. In this study, we found that the cortical and hippocampal expression of neuritin is reduced in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and demonstrated that viral-mediated expression of neuritin in the dentate gyrus of 13-month-old Tg2576 mice, an AD animal model, attenuated a deficit in learning and memory as assessed by a Morris water maze test. We also found that neuritin restored the reduction in dendritic spine density and the maturity of individual spines in primary hippocampal neuron cultures prepared from Tg2576 mice. It was also shown that viral-mediated expression of neuritin in the dentate gyrus of 7-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Taken together, our results demonstrate that neuritin restores the reduction in dendritic spine density and the maturity of individual spines in primary hippocampal neurons from Tg2576 neurons, and also attenuates cognitive function deficits in Tg2576 mouse model of AD, suggesting that neuritin possesses a therapeutic potential for AD.  
23595620	Altered expression of diabetes-related genes in Alzheimer's disease brains: the hisayama study.
Cereb. Cortex 20130417 2014Sep
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered to be a risk factor for dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this risk is not well understood. We examined gene expression profiles in postmortem human brains donated for the Hisayama study. Three-way analysis of variance of microarray data from frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus was performed with the presence/absence of AD and vascular dementia, and sex, as factors. Comparative analyses of expression changes in the brains of AD patients and a mouse model of AD were also performed. Relevant changes in gene expression identified by microarray analysis were validated by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The hippocampi of AD brains showed the most significant alteration in gene expression profile. Genes involved in noninsulin-dependent DM and obesity were significantly altered in both AD brains and the AD mouse model, as were genes related to psychiatric disorders and AD. The alterations in the expression profiles of DM-related genes in AD brains were independent of peripheral DM-related abnormalities. These results indicate that altered expression of genes related to DM in AD brains is a result of AD pathology, which may thereby be exacerbated by peripheral insulin resistance or DM.  
24898635	Regional Fluorodeoxyglucose Metabolism and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living across the Alzheimer's Disease Spectrum.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) begins as individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) transition to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. IADL impairment in AD dementia has been associated with inferior parietal, inferior temporal, and superior occipital hypometabolism using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). To investigate the relationship between regional FDG metabolism and IADL in clinically normal (CN) elderly, MCI, and mild AD dementia subjects cross-sectionally and longitudinally. One hundred and four CN, 203 MCI, and 95 AD dementia subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent clinical assessments every 6 to 12 months for up to three years and baseline FDG PET. The subjective, informant-based Functional Activities Questionnaire was used to assess IADL. General linear models and mixed effects models were used, covarying for demographics, cognition, and behavior. The cross-sectional analysis revealed middle frontal and orbitofrontal hypometabolism were significantly associated with greater IADL impairment. Additionally, the interaction of diagnosis with posterior cingulate and with parahippocampal hypometabolism showed a greater decline in IADL performance as metabolism decreased for the AD dementia relative to the MCI group, and the MCI group relative to the CN group. The longitudinal analysis showed that baseline middle frontal and posterior cingulate hypometabolism were significantly associated with greater rate of increase in IADL impairment over time. These results suggest that regional synaptic dysfunction, including the Alzheimer-typical medial parietal and less typical frontal regions, relates to daily functioning decline at baseline and over time across the early AD spectrum. 
24694177	Plasma metabolite profiles of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
J. Proteome Res. 20140414 2014May2
Previous studies have demonstrated altered metabolites in samples of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the sample size from many of them is relatively small and the metabolites are relatively limited. Here we applied a comprehensive platform using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze plasma samples from AD patients, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and normal controls. A biomarker panel consisting of six plasma metabolites (arachidonic acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, thymine, glutamine, glutamic acid, and cytidine) was identified to discriminate AD patients from normal control. Another panel of five plasma metabolites (thymine, arachidonic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, and 5,8-tetradecadienoic acid) was able to differentiate aMCI patients from control subjects. Both biomarker panels had good agreements with clinical diagnosis. The 2 panels of metabolite markers were all involved in fatty acid metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism. Additionally, no altered metabolites were found among the patients at different stages, as well as among those on anticholinesterase medication and those without anticholinesterase medication. These findings provide a comprehensive global plasma metabolite profiling and may contribute to making early diagnosis as well as understanding the pathogenic mechanism of AD and aMCI.  
25016233	Tetrahydrobenzo[h][1,6]naphthyridine-6-chlorotacrine hybrids as a new family of anti-Alzheimer agents targeting Î²-amyloid, tau, and cholinesterase pathologies.
Eur J Med Chem 20140707 2014Sep12
Optimization of an essentially inactive 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[3,2-c]quinoline carboxylic ester derivative as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) peripheral anionic site (PAS)-binding motif by double OÂ â†’Â NH bioisosteric replacement, combined with molecular hybridization with the AChE catalytic anionic site (CAS) inhibitor 6-chlorotacrine and molecular dynamics-driven optimization of the length of the linker has resulted in the development of the trimethylene-linked 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[h][1,6]naphthyridine-6-chlorotacrine hybrid 5a as a picomolar inhibitor of human AChE (hAChE). The tetra-, penta-, and octamethylene-linked homologues 5b-d have been also synthesized for comparison purposes, and found to retain the nanomolar hAChE inhibitory potency of the parent 6-chlorotacrine. Further biological profiling of hybrids 5a-d has shown that they are also potent inhibitors of human butyrylcholinesterase and moderately potent AÎ²42 and tau anti-aggregating agents, with IC50 values in the submicromolar and low micromolar range, respectively. Also, inÂ vitro studies using an artificial membrane model have predicted a good brain permeability for hybrids 5a-d, and hence, their ability to reach their targets in the central nervous system. The multitarget profile of the novel hybrids makes them promising leads for developing anti-Alzheimer drug candidates with more balanced biological activities.  
24919109	Use of amyloid PET across the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease: clinical utility and associated ethical issues.
Amyloid 20140611 2014Sep
Abstract Recent advances have made possible the in vivo detection of beta-amyloid (AÎ²) pathology using positron emission tomography. While the gold standard for amyloid imaging, carbon-11 labeled Pittsburgh compound B is increasingly being replaced by fluorine-18 labeled radiopharmaceuticals, with three already approved for clinical use by US and European regulatory bodies. Appropriate use criteria proposed by an amyloid imaging taskforce convened by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging recommend restricting use of this technology to the evaluation of patients with mild cognitive impairment or atypical dementia syndromes. While use among asymptomatic individuals is currently viewed as inappropriate due prognostic uncertainty, elevated levels of brain AÎ² among asymptomatic individuals may represent preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid imaging is likewise expected to play a role in the design of clinical trials. Though preliminary results suggest amyloid imaging to possess clinical utility and cost-effectiveness, both domains have yet to be assessed systematically. As the field moves toward adoption of a pro-disclosure stance for amyloid imaging findings, it is imperative that a broad range of stakeholders be involved to ensure the appropriateness of emerging policies and protocols.  
25130729	Conformation-specific antibodies to target amyloid Î² oligomers and their application to immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.
Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem.  2014Aug
Amyloid Î²-protein (AÎ²) oligomers, intermediates of AÎ² aggregation, cause cognitive impairment and synaptotoxicity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy using anti-AÎ² antibody is one of the most promising approaches for AD treatment. However, most clinical trials using conventional sequence-specific antibodies have proceeded with difficulty. This is probably due to the unintended removal of the non-pathological monomer and fibrils of AÎ² as well as the pathological oligomers by these antibodies that recognize AÎ² sequence, which is not involved in synaptotoxicity. Several efforts have been made recently to develop conformation-specific antibodies that target the tertiary structure of AÎ² oligomers. Here, we review the recent findings of AÎ² oligomers and anti-AÎ² antibodies including our own, and discuss their potential as therapeutic and diagnostic tools.  
24922524	Effect of Tacrine-3-caffeic Acid, A Novel Multifunctional Anti-Alzheimer's Dimer, Against Oxidative-Stress-Induced Cell Death in HT22 Hippocampal Neurons: Involvement of Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway.
CNS Neurosci Ther 20140612 2014Sep
Oxidative stress (OS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was designed to uncover the cellular and biochemical mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of tacrine-3-caffeic acid (T3CA), a novel promising multifunctional anti-Alzheimer's dimer, against OS-induced neuronal death. T3CA protected HT22 cells against high-concentration-glutamate-induced cell death in time- and concentration-dependent manners and potently attenuated glutamate-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as mitochondrial membrane-potential (Î”Î¨) disruption. Besides, T3CA significantly induced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation and increased its transcriptional activity, which were demonstrated by Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter gene assay. Further studies showed that T3CA potently up-regulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an endogenous antioxidative enzyme and a downstream effector of Nrf2, at both mRNA and protein levels. The neuroprotective effects of T3CA were partially reversed by brusatol, which reduced protein level of Nrf2, or by inhibiting HO-1 with siRNA or ZnPP-IX, a specific inhibitor of HO-1. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that T3CA protects neurons against OS-induced cell death partially through Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 signaling pathway, which further supports that T3CA might be a promising novel therapeutic agent for OS-associated diseases. 
25131589	Amyloid Î²-peptide and Alzheimer's disease.
Essays Biochem.  2014Aug18
One of the hallmarks of AD (Alzheimer's disease) is the formation of senile plaques in the brain, which contain fibrils composed of AÎ² (amyloid Î²-peptide). According to the 'amyloid cascade' hypothesis, the aggregation of AÎ² initiates a sequence of events leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, neurodegeneration, and on to the main symptom of dementia. However, emphasis has now shifted away from fibrillar forms of AÎ² and towards smaller and more soluble 'oligomers' as the main culprit in AD. The present chapter commences with a brief introduction to the disease and its current treatment, and then focuses on the formation of AÎ² from the APP (amyloid precursor protein), the genetics of early-onset AD, which has provided strong support for the amyloid cascade hypothesis, and then on the development of new drugs aimed at reducing the load of cerebral AÎ², which is still the main hope for providing a more effective treatment for AD in the future.  
24888235	Regional analysis of striatal and cortical amyloid deposition in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Eur. J. Neurosci. 20140602 2014Aug
We aimed to analyse the detailed distribution pattern of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) in the striatum, and to examine whether there is any correlation between AÎ² deposition levels in the striatum and cortical regions. Twenty patients with Alzheimer's disease underwent positron emission tomography using (11) C-Pittsburgh Compound B ((11) C-PiB) to quantify the AÎ² deposition. Volumes-of-interest analyses were performed on the ventral striatum (VST), pre-commissural dorsal caudate (pre-DCA), post-commissural caudate (post-CA), pre-commissural dorsal putamen (pre-DPU), and post-commissural putamen (post-PU), followed by exploratory voxel-wise analyses. Volumes-of-interest analyses of (11) C-PiB binding showed: VST &gt; pre-DPU (PÂ =Â 0.004), VST &gt; pre-DCA (PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001), pre-DPU &gt; post-PU (PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001), and pre-DCA &gt; post-CA (PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001), consistent with visual inspection of the (11) C-PiB images. Exploratory voxel-wise analyses of (11) C-PiB binding showed a positive correlation between the VST and the medial part of the orbitofrontal area (PÂ &lt;Â 0.01 family-wise error corrected). This study confirmed that there were ventral &gt; dorsal, and anterior &gt; posterior gradients of AÎ² deposition in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and provided the first evidence of a robust correlation between AÎ² deposition levels in the VST and the medial part of the orbitofrontal area. There are well-known anatomical and functional links between these areas. These findings indicated that brain AÎ² deposition was not randomly distributed, but had characteristic patterns related to anatomical connectivity and/or functional networks.  
24436135	The effects of combine treatment of memantine and donepezil on Alzheimer's Disease patients and its relationship with cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal area.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20140117 2014Sep
In this study, we evaluated the effect on cognitive function of memantine, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and the care burden, in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), we examined the association between effect of memantine and brain blood flow. We evaluated the effect of memantine administration from baseline on Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale, mini mental state examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Japanese version of the Zarit Burden Interview (J-ZBI) and NIRS in two groups, donepezil administration memantine combination group (combination group, nâ€‰=â€‰19) donepezil administration memantine non-administration group (control group, nâ€‰=â€‰18) were assessed at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Significant difference was found between the combination group and the control group in the score variation of Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale, MMSE, CDT, NPI, and J-ZBI. In the NIRS measurements, trend oxyhemoglobin reduced suppression was observed in some channels centered on the superior frontal gyrus. A significant correlation was observed in the scores of MMSE, CDT, NPI, and J-ZBI. In addition, a significant positive correlation was also observed between the number of words in NIRS and scores of MMSE and CDT. In this study, by administering memantine in AD patients that inhibit the reduction of cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal area and improve clinical symptoms overall cognitive function, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, thereby reducing the care burden of caregivers was suggested.

24549933	Efficacy of higher-dose 13.3â€‰mg/24 h (15â€‰cm(2) ) rivastigmine patch on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale: domain and individual item analysis.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20140218 2014Sep
Rivastigmine displays dose-dependent efficacy on cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Subanalysis of the OPTIMA (OPtimising Transdermal Exelon In Mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease) study aimed to define ADAS-cog domains by factor analysis of individual items. Efficacy of 13.3 mg/24 h versus 9.5â€‰mg/24 h rivastigmine patch on individual items and newly derived domains was assessed. OPTIMA was a 48-week, double-blind (DB) study in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Patients meeting pre-defined decline criteria during open-label treatment with 9.5â€‰mg/24 h patch were randomized in the DB phase to 13.3 mg/24 h (nâ€‰=â€‰280) or 9.5â€‰mg/24 h (nâ€‰=â€‰287) patch. ADAS-cog change from baseline was a co-primary outcome measure. Factor analysis categorized ADAS-cog items into newly derived domains. Change from DB-baseline was calculated for domains and individual items. Numerically, less decline was displayed with 13.3 mg/24 h versus 9.5â€‰mg/24 h patch in the total ADAS-cog score at all time points (significant at Week 24, pâ€‰=â€‰0.027). Factor analysis identified two domains: memory and language. Significantly, less decline was observed on the memory domain with 13.3 mg/24 h versus 9.5â€‰mg/24 h patch at Weeks 12, 24, and 48 (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05; observed cases). Three items (following commands, orientation, and word recognition) displayed numerically less decline with 13.3 mg/24 h versus 9.5â€‰mg/24 h patch at all time points. No significant between-group differences were observed on the language domain. Results suggest that the greater cognitive efficacy of 13.3 mg/24 h versus 9.5â€‰mg/24 h rivastigmine patch is driven primarily by effects on memory, particularly in the areas of following commands, orientation, and word recognition.

24661139	Gastrodin alleviates memory deficits and reduces neuropathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropathology 20140325 2014Aug
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease, characterized by excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) and activation of microglia cells and astrocytes. In this research, we evaluated whether gastrodin, an active component isolated from the rhizome of Gastrodia elata, has neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of AD, Tg2576 mice. Treatment of gastrodin (60â€‰mg/kg for 15 days) significantly improved memory impairments in the Morris water maze test and probe test. Moreover, immunohistochemical and ELISA results indicated that gastrodin significantly attenuated AÎ² deposition and glial activation in brains of these transgenic mice. These findings suggested that gastrodin exerted neuroprotective activity via anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic effects and that gastrodin may be a potential option for AD therapy.  
25038421	DNA methyltransferase haplotype is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140717 2014Sep5
Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in syndromes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, but little is known about the role of epigenetics in Alzheimer's disease (AD). DNA methylation, one of the main epigenetic mechanisms, is a complex process carried out by specific enzymes, such as DNMT1 and DNMT3B. This study aimed to investigate the association between DNMT1 and DNMT3B polymorphisms and AD. Two hundred and ten elderly subjects (108 healthy controls and 102 with AD-NINCDS/ARDA, DSM-IV-TR criteria) were assessed. DNA was obtained from whole blood, and genotypes were detected by an allelic discrimination assay using TaqMan(Â®) MGB probes on a real-time PCR system. The polymorphisms studied were rs2162560, rs759920 (DNMT1) and rs998382, rs2424913, rs2424932 (DNMT3B). For both genes, the polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium. Carriers of the DNMT3B TGG haplotype were associated with AD (OR=3.03, 95% CI 1.63 to 5.63, P&lt;0.001). No significant difference between AD and the control group were observed for DNMT1 polymorphisms. This study is one of the first describing a significant association between DNMT3B polymorphisms and AD. This enzyme, which is responsible for methylation in a general way, may be involved in AD.  
24072067	Titers of herpes simplex virus type 1 antibodies positively correlate with grey matter volumes in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
HSV-1 infection of the central nervous system targets the same brain regions most affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and could play a pathogenic role in AD. HSV-1 serum IgG titers were analyzed in patients with mild AD (n = 83) and healthy controls (HC, n = 51); results were correlated with cortical grey matter (GM) volumes as analyzed by MRI. Seroprevalence and antibody (Ab) titers were comparable between AD and HC; elevated Ab titers (&gt;75th percentile) were nevertheless significantly more frequent in AD and were positively correlated with cortical bilateral temporal and orbitofrontal GM volumes. HSV-1-specific-Ab could possibly play a protective role in the early stages of AD.  
24072068	In vitro amyloid-Î² binding and inhibition of amyloid-Î² self-association by therapeutic albumin.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
A promising approach for treating Alzheimer's disease relies on the net efflux of the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide from the brain to peripheral plasma, as a result of plasma AÎ² clearance promoted by plasma removal and therapeutic albumin replacement. To assess the binding of therapeutic albumin (Albutein, Grifols) to monomeric and aggregated AÎ² according to methods previously tested on the interactions between AÎ² and research-grade albumin. Albumin integrity and the interactions with albumin stabilizers (octanoic acid and N-Ac-Trp) were assessed through one-dimensional (1D) 1H-NMR and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectra. The interactions between monomeric AÎ²1-40 and albumin were probed by 2D 1H-15 N HSQC spectra of labeled AÎ²1-40. The formation of cross-Î² structured AÎ²1-42 assemblies was monitored by ThT fluorescence. The interactions between self-assembled AÎ²1-42 and albumin were probed by Trp fluorescence. NMR spectra indicated that both therapeutic and research-grade albumin are similarly well-folded proteins. No significant changes in either HSQC peak position or intensity were observed upon addition of albumin to 15N-labeled AÎ²1-40, which rules out binding of albumin to monomeric AÎ² with dissociation constant in the Î¼M or lower range. When aggregated AÎ²1-42 was added to albumin, quenching of Trp fluorescence was observed, which indicates albumin binding to AÎ²1-42 aggregates. The relative potency of therapeutic albumin as an AÎ² self-association inhibitor was in the same order of magnitude as research-grade albumin. Albutein inhibited AÎ² self-association by selectively binding AÎ² aggregates rather than monomers and by preventing further growth of the AÎ² assemblies. 
24072069	Meta-analysis of serum non-ceruloplasmin copper in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The fraction of copper not bound to ceruloplasmin seems altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have addressed this notion evaluating all the studies carried out from 1996 until March 2013 by means of meta-analysis. We performed our analysis on diverse indices evaluating the relationship between copper and ceruloplasmin in general circulation, namely 'Non-Cp copper', '% Non-Cp copper', and 'Adjusted copper'. For Non-Cp copper and % Non-Cp copper, the correct stoichiometry between copper and ceruloplasmin (6-8 atoms of copper for each ceruloplasmin molecule) in healthy controls has been adopted as criterion for the study to be included in the meta-analysis evaluating data with the canonic Walshe's formula for Non-Cp copper. Copper to ceruloplasmin ratio (Cu:Cp), which is an internal quality control check for ceruloplasmin calibration, was used as an index of the actual stoichiometry in the specimens. Adjusted (Adj-Cp) copper, even though less reliable, was calculated, allowing the evaluation of all the studies selected. An additional meta-analysis of systemic total copper was re-calculated accounting for all the studies carried out from 1983 to March 2013. Ten studies were analyzed in the meta-analysis for Non-Cp copper and % Non-Cp copper reaching a pooled total of 599 AD subjects and 867 controls. For Adj-Cp copper, 14 studies were analyzed with a pooled total of 879 AD and 1,712 controls. 27 studies were considered for systemic total copper meta-analysis, with a pooled total of 1,393 AD and 2,159 controls. All the copper indices analyzed were significantly higher in AD subjects compared to healthy controls.  
24072070	Early molecular changes in Alzheimer disease: can we catch the disease in its presymptomatic phase?
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and characterized by deposition of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau, atrophy, and progressive neurodegeneration. While the familial, early onset form of AD is known to be caused by specific mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1, presenilin 2, or amyloid-Î² protein precursor, the underlying mechanisms leading to the development of sporadic AD are still not known. The major risk factors are, however, aging and APOE Îµ4. Here we review the latest evidence for the involvement of malfunctioning insulin signaling, dysfunction of mitochondria-associated membranes, cerebrovascular changes, increased oxidative stress and free radical formation, DNA damage, disturbed energy metabolism, and synaptic dysfunction in early stages of AD. We focus on whether the changes in these processes precede or succeed the earliest symptoms in AD patients, i.e., minimal cognitive impairment. Since changes in AÎ² processing are probably a key event in AD we also highlight the relationship of the above mentioned processes with the formation, secretion, aggregation, and toxicity of AÎ². Based on our literature findings we propose a model in which insulin dysfunction, pathological cerebrovascular changes, dysfunction of mitochondria-associated membranes, and/or synaptic changes are likely to interact with each other, thereby initiating and facilitating the development of AD pathology by accelerating the production and deposition of AÎ². Increased oxidative stress and free radical formation, DNA damage, disturbed energy metabolism, and synaptic loss follow these events, but still occur very early in AD.  
24077432	Oral infections and orofacial pain in Alzheimer's disease: a case-control study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Dental infections are frequent and have recently been implicated as a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite a lack of studies investigating orofacial pain in this patient group, dental conditions are known to be a potential cause of pain and to affect quality of life and disease progression. To evaluate oral status, mandibular function and orofacial pain in patients with mild AD versus healthy subjects matched for age and gender. Twenty-nine patients and 30 control subjects were evaluated. The protocol comprised a clinical questionnaire and dental exam, research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the decayed, missing, and filled teeth index, and included a full periodontal evaluation. AD signs and symptoms as well as associated factors were evaluated by a trained neurologist. A higher prevalence of orofacial pain (20.7%, p &lt; 0.001), articular abnormalities in temporomandibular joints (p &lt; 0.05), and periodontal infections (p = 0.002) was observed in the study group compared to the control group. Orofacial pain and periodontal infections were more frequent in patients with mild AD than in healthy subjects. Orofacial pain screening and dental and oral exams should be routinely performed in AD patients in order to identify pathological conditions that need treatment thus improving quality of life compromised due to dementia. 
24077436	Amyloid-Î² alters the DNA methylation status of cell-fate genes in an Alzheimer's disease model.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid-Î² plaques (AÎ²). Despite ongoing research, some ambiguity remains surrounding the role of AÎ² in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease. While several studies have focused on the mutations associated with AD, our understanding of the epigenetic contributions to the disease remains less clear. To that end, we determined the changes in DNA methylation in differentiated human neurons with and without AÎ² treatment. DNA was isolated from neurons treated with AÎ² or vehicle, and the two samples were digested with either a methylation-sensitive (HpaII) or a methylation-insensitive (MspI) restriction endonuclease. The fragments were amplified and co-hybridized to a commercial promoter microarray. Data analysis revealed a subset of genomic loci that shows a significant change in DNA methylation following AÎ² treatment in comparison to the control group. After mapping these loci to nearby genes, we discovered high enrichment for cell-fate genes that control apoptosis and neuronal differentiation. Finally, we incorporated three of those genes in a possible model suggesting the means by which AÎ² contributes to the brain shrinkage and memory loss seen in AD.  
24081377	The role of ABCA1 gene sequence variants on risk of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 1 gene (ABCA1) is a candidate risk gene for late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) as a consequence of its role in cholesterol transport and metabolism, which is implicated in LOAD risk. ABCA1 has been shown in mouse models to enable the clearance of amyloid-Î² peptide from the brain, through its role in the lipidation of apolipoprotein (APOE). Although recent large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have failed to find significant associations with common genetic variants in this gene and LOAD, rare variants in ABCA1 have been shown to influence plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Using next generation sequencing of pooled DNA samples, we sequenced all the coding regions of ABCA1 in 311 LOAD cases and 360 control individuals drawn from the Greek population to identify low frequency non-synonymous variation. There were a significantly higher proportion of rare non-synonymous variants in control individuals compared to AD cases, suggestive of a protective effect. These findings provide new evidence of an effect of ABCA1 variants on AD risk. In addition they highlight the importance of high throughput sequencing in the identification of rare variation undetected by GWAS, but with the potential to have a strong effect on risk of LOAD.  
24100125	Stroop effects in Alzheimer's disease: selective attention speed of processing, or color-naming? A meta-analysis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Selective attention, an essential part of daily activity, is often impaired in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Usually, it is measured by the color-word Stroop test. However, there is no universal agreement whether performance on the Stroop task changes significantly in AD patients; or if so, whether an increase in Stroop effects reflects a decrease in selective attention, a slowing in generalized speed of processing (SOP), or is the result of degraded color-vision. The current study investigated the impact of AD on Stroop performance and its potential sources in a meta-analysis and mathematical modeling of 18 studies, comparing 637 AD patients with 977 healthy age-matched participants. We found a significant increase in Stroop effects for AD patients, across studies. This AD-related change was associated with a slowing in SOP. However, after correcting for a bias in the distribution of latencies, SOP could only explain a moderate portion of the total variance (25%). Moreover, we found strong evidence for an AD-related increase in the latency difference between naming the font-color and reading color-neutral stimuli (r2 = 0.98). This increase in the dimensional imbalance between color-naming and word-reading was found to explain a significant portion of the AD-related increase in Stroop effects (r2 = 0.87), hinting on a possible sensory source. In conclusion, our analysis highlights the importance of controlling for sensory degradation and SOP when testing cognitive performance and, specifically, selective attention in AD patients. We also suggest possible measures and tools to better test for selective attention in AD.  
24121958	Relationship among diffusion tensor imaging, EEG activity, and cognitive status in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can detect microstructural alterations by means of fractional anisotropy (FA) in patients with dementia, also in relation to cognitive status. The present study aimed at investigating the possible relation among white matter damage in DTI, quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power, and cognitive status in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Forty-seven subjects (8 moderate AD, 18 mild AD, 12 MCI, and 9 healthy controls) underwent brain MR, neuropsychological evaluation, and resting EEG recording. A progressive increase of EEG delta and theta spectral power was observed from controls to patients, mainly in more anterior areas, with a parallel widespread decrease of beta power. Moreover, a progressive decrease of FA from controls to patients in frontal areas and in the corpus callosum (genu) was observed. Correlation analyses indicated convergence among EEG rhythms changes, DTI values, and cognitive status mainly over anterior areas. The decrease of FA values and EEG spectral power changes might represent markers of neurodegenerative dysfunction, possibly preceding macrostructural atrophy.  
24121965	Pathogen-free husbandry conditions alleviate behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration in AD10 anti-NGF mice.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
It has been suggested that systemic infection, occurring during aging and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, can evoke an immune response that aggravates the progression of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. It has been shown that the AD11 neurodegeneration mouse model, expressing a recombinant anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) antibody, shows a milder phenotype when housed in murine pathogen-free (MPF) conditions with respect to AD11 mice reared in conventional (CV) housing. AD10 mice, a variant of the anti-NGF AD11 model, expressing only an immunoglobulin light chain for the transgenic anti-NGF antibody, in the absence of the corresponding transgenic antibody chain VH, exhibit a complex neurodegenerative phenotype, similar to that of AD11 mice. Here we show that the AD10 transgenic mice, housed in murine pathogen-free conditions (MPF-AD10 mice), also display a milder behavioral and neurodegenerative phenotype compared to the corresponding mice kept under conventional housing conditions (CV-AD10). As a first step toward the identification of mechanisms underlying this difference, a differential gene expression profiling was performed on brains from CV-AD10 and MPF-AD10 mice, showing a decrease of the immune response and neuroinflammation gene expression in MPF-AD10 mice. Results suggest that the activation of the immune response gene expression in the CV-AD10, in a microbially unprotected environment, might contribute to a more severe and progressive neurodegenerative phenotype, compared to the MPF mice.  
23535033	Genome-wide association study of the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130325 2014Jan
Substantial interindividual variability exists in the disease trajectories of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Some decline rapidly whereas others decline slowly, and there are no known explanations for this variability. We describe the first genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive decline in a sample of AD patients with longitudinal measures of cognition. The discovery sample was 303 AD cases recruited in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the replication sample was 323 AD cases from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In the discovery sample, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale responses were tested for association with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linear regression. We tested the 65 most significant SNPs from the discovery sample for association in the replication sample. We identified SNPs in the spondin 1 gene (SPON1), the minor alleles of which were significantly associated with a slower rate of decline (rs11023139, PÂ =Â 7.0Â Ã—Â 10(-11)) in the discovery sample. A SPON1 SNP 5.5 kb upstream was associated with decline in the replication sample (rs11606345, P = .002). SPON1 has not been previously associated with AD risk, but is plausibly related because the gene product binds to the amyloid precursor protein and inhibits its cleavage by Î²-secretase. These data suggest that SPON1 may be associated with the differential rate of cognitive decline in AD. 
24495969	Follow-up of loci from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Disease Project identifies TRIP4 as a novel susceptibility gene.
Transl Psychiatry 20140204 2014
To follow-up loci discovered by the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Disease Project, we attempted independent replication of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large Spanish sample (FundaciÃ³ ACE data set; 1808 patients and 2564 controls). Our results corroborate association with four SNPs located in the genes INPP5D, MEF2C, ZCWPW1 and FERMT2, respectively. Of these, ZCWPW1 was the only SNP to withstand correction for multiple testing (P=0.000655). Furthermore, we identify TRIP4 (rs74615166) as a novel genome-wide significant locus for Alzheimer's disease risk (odds ratio=1.31; confidence interval 95% (1.19-1.44); P=9.74 Ã— 10(-)(9)). 
24501359	In vivo activation of Wnt signaling pathway enhances cognitive function of adult mice and reverses cognitive deficits in an Alzheimer's disease model.
J. Neurosci.  2014Feb5
The role of the Wnt signaling pathway during synaptic development has been well established. In the adult brain, different components of Wnt signaling are expressed, but little is known about its role in mature synapses. Emerging in vitro studies have implicated Wnt signaling in synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signaling has shown to protect against amyloid-Î²-induced synaptic impairment. The present study provides the first evidence that in vivo activation of Wnt signaling improves episodic memory, increases excitatory synaptic transmission, and enhances long-term potentiation in adult wild-type mice. Moreover, the activation of Wnt signaling also rescues memory loss and improves synaptic dysfunction in APP/PS1-transgenic mice that model the amyloid pathology of Alzheimer's diseases. These findings indicate that Wnt signaling modulates cognitive function in the adult brain and could be a novel promising target for Alzheimer's disease therapy.  
24473795	Elevated serum pesticide levels and risk for Alzheimer disease.
JAMA Neurol  2014Mar
The causes of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) are not yet understood but likely include a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Limited epidemiological studies suggest that occupational pesticide exposures are associated with AD. Previously, we reported that serum levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), were elevated in a small number of patients with AD (n=20). To evaluate the association between serum levels of DDE and AD and whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modifies the association. A case-control study consisting of existing samples from patients with AD and control participants from the Emory University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School's Alzheimer's Disease Center. Serum levels of DDE were measured in 79 control and 86 AD cases. Serum DDE levels, AD diagnosis, severity of AD measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination score, and interaction with APOE4 status. Levels of DDE were 3.8-fold higher in the serum of those with AD (mean [SEM], 2.64 [0.35] ng/mg cholesterol) when compared with control participants (mean [SEM], 0.69 [0.1] ng/mg cholesterol; P &lt;â€‰.001). The highest tertile of DDE levels was associated with an odds ratio of 4.18 for increased risk for AD (95% CI, 2.54-5.82; P &lt;â€‰.001) and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (-1.605; range, -3.095 to -0.114; P &lt;â€‰.0001). The Mini-Mental State Examination scores in the highest tertile of DDE were -1.753 points lower in the subpopulation carrying an APOE Îµ4 allele compared with those carrying an APOE Îµ3 allele (P interaction =â€‰.04). Serum levels of DDE were highly correlated with brain levels of DDE (Ï? = 0.95). Exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to DDT or DDE increased levels of amyloid precursor protein. Elevated serum DDE levels are associated with an increased risk for AD and carriers of an APOE4 Îµ4 allele may be more susceptible to the effects of DDE. Both DDT and DDE increase amyloid precursor protein levels, providing mechanistic plausibility for the association of DDE exposure with AD. Identifying people who have elevated levels of DDE and carry an APOE Îµ4 allele may lead to early identification of some cases of AD. 
24439484	Missense variant in TREML2 protects against Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131221 2014Jun
TREM and TREM-like receptors are a structurally similar protein family encoded by genes clustered on chromosome 6p21.11. Recent studies have identified a rare coding variant (p.R47H) in TREM2 that confers a high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms in this genomic region are associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD and a common intergenic variant found near the TREML2 gene has been identified to be protective for AD. However, little is known about the functional variant underlying the latter association or its relationship with the p.R47H. Here, we report comprehensive analyses using whole-exome sequencing data, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analyses, meta-analyses (16,254 cases and 20,052 controls) and cell-based functional studies to support the role of the TREML2 coding missense variant p.S144G (rs3747742) as a potential driver of the meta-analysis AD-associated genome-wide association studies signal. Additionally, we demonstrate that the protective role of TREML2 in AD is independent of the role of TREM2 gene as a risk factor for AD.  
24922517	Gene-wide analysis detects two new susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140612 2014
Alzheimer's disease is a common debilitating dementia with known heritability, for which 20 late onset susceptibility loci have been identified, but more remain to be discovered. This study sought to identify new susceptibility genes, using an alternative gene-wide analytical approach which tests for patterns of association within genes, in the powerful genome-wide association dataset of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project Consortium, comprising over 7 m genotypes from 25,580 Alzheimer's cases and 48,466 controls. In addition to earlier reported genes, we detected genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 8 (TP53INP1, pâ€Š=â€Š1.4Ã—10-6) and 14 (IGHV1-67 pâ€Š=â€Š7.9Ã—10-8) which indexed novel susceptibility loci. The additional genes identified in this study, have an array of functions previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease, including aspects of energy metabolism, protein degradation and the immune system and add further weight to these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease. 
24434111	Sex differences in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Front Neuroendocrinol 20140113 2014Aug
Studies have shown differences in specific cognitive ability domains and risk of Alzheimer's disease between the men and women at later age. However it is important to know that sex differences in cognitive function during adulthood may have their basis in both organizational effects, i.e., occurring as early as during the neuronal development period, as well as in activational effects, where the influence of the sex steroids influence brain function in adulthood. Further, the rate of cognitive decline with aging is also different between the sexes. Understanding the biology of sex differences in cognitive function will not only provide insight into Alzheimer's disease prevention, but also is integral to the development of personalized, gender-specific medicine. This review draws on epidemiological, translational, clinical, and basic science studies to assess the impact of sex differences in cognitive function from young to old, and examines the effects of sex hormone treatments on Alzheimer's disease in men and women.  
24168366	Subcellular injuries in Alzheimer's disease.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia occurring in the elderly. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of AD, including amyloidogenesis, disruption of calcium homeostasis, energetic failure, induction of oxidative stress, and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. This review examines associations between cellular and subcellular injuries, neurodegeneration, and cell death in experimental models, clinical symptoms, and autopsy reports of AD to identify the subcellular events leading to disease onset and progression. The order in which these events occur is discussed. The first injuries reported in AD are subcellular and occur at the Golgi apparatus before any Î²-amyloid proteins deposit in the Golgi and endosomes. This is followed by lysosomal alterations and the inability of cells to clear Î²-amyloid. The next stage reveals functional changes and modifications in hippocampal synaptic transmission before structural changes are observed at the cellular level. Subsequently, an extensive intracellular inflammatory process develops in neurons and astrocytes. This inflammatory reaction begins in the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes and mitochondria, and is thought to lead to neurodegeneration and cell death. Finally, the neuroinflammatory response of chronically activated microglia escalates the neurodegeneration and cell death. Identifying the detailed sequence of subcellular events induced by the primum movens defect in AD may lead to the identification of novel drug targets for the treatment of the disease. 
24576002	Crystal structure and interaction of phycocyanin with Î²-secretase: A putative therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a neurological disorder, which is caused by enzymatic degradation of an amyloid precursor protein into short peptide fragments that undergo association to form insoluble plaques. Preliminary studies suggest that cyanobacterial extracts, especially the light-harvesting protein phycocyanin, may provide a means to control the progression of the disease. However, the molecular mechanism of disease control remains elusive. In the present study, intact hexameric phycocyanin was isolated and crystallized from the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp. N62DM, and the structure was solved to a resolution of 2.6 A. Molecular docking studies show that the phycocyanin Î±Î²-dimer interacts with the enzyme Î²-secretase, which catalyzes the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein to form plaques. The molecular docking studies suggest that the interaction between phycocyanin and Î²-secretase is energetically more favorable than previously reported inhibitor-Î²-secretase interactions. Transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans worms, with a genotype to serve as an AD-model, were significantly protected by phycocyanin. Therefore, the present study provides a novel structure-based molecular mechanism of phycocyanin-mediated therapy against AD. 
25100603	Knock-In of Human BACE1 Cleaves Murine APP and Reiterates Alzheimer-like Phenotypes.
J. Neurosci.  2014Aug6
Key neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are elevated levels of amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) species generated via amyloid precursor protein (APP) endoproteolysis and cleavage by the rate-limiting Î²-site enzyme 1 (BACE1). Because rodents do not develop amyloid pathologies, we here investigated whether AD-like endophenotypes can be created in mice by expression of human bace1. To avoid pitfalls of existing models, we introduced hbace1 via knock-in under the control of the CaMKII Î± promoter into the safe HPRT locus. We report amyloidogenic processing of murine APP in the hBACE1 mice (termed PLB4), resulting in the formation of toxic APP metabolites that accumulate intra- and extraneuronally in hippocampus and cortex. Pronounced accumulation of AÎ²*56 and AÎ² hexamers in the absence of plaque deposition was detected in brain tissue from symptomatic PLB4 mice. Heightened levels of inflammation (gliosis) also appeared in several AD-related brain regions (dentate gyrus, hippocampal area CA1, piriform and parietal cortices) at 6 and 12 months of age. Behaviorally, deficits in habituation to a novel environment and semantic-like memory (social transmission of food preference) were detected from 3 to 4 months of age. Impairments in spatial learning strategies in long-term reference (water maze) and working memory (Y-maze) tasks presented at 6 months, and were distinct from reductions in locomotor activity and anxiety. Overall, our data indicate for the first time that targeted, subtle forebrain-specific expression through single gene knock-in of hBACE1 is sufficient to generate AD-relevant cognitive impairments amid corresponding histopathologies, confirming human BACE as the key parameter in amyloid pathogenesis.  
25114532	Caregiver burden and coping strategies in caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat 20140729 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes considerable distress in caregivers who are continuously required to deal with requests from patients. Coping strategies play a fundamental role in modulating the psychologic impact of the disease, although their role is still debated. The present study aims to evaluate the burden and anxiety experienced by caregivers, the effectiveness of adopted coping strategies, and their relationships with burden and anxiety. Eighty-six caregivers received the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Y-1 and Y-2). The coping strategies were assessed by means of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), according to the model proposed by Endler and Parker in 1990. The CBI scores (overall and single sections) were extremely high and correlated with dementia severity. Women, as well as older caregivers, showed higher scores. The trait anxiety (STAI-Y-2) correlated with the CBI overall score. The CISS showed that caregivers mainly adopted task-focused strategies. Women mainly adopted emotion-focused strategies and this style was related to a higher level of distress. AD is associated with high distress among caregivers. The burden strongly correlates with dementia severity and is higher in women and in elderly subjects. Chronic anxiety affects caregivers who mainly rely on emotion-oriented coping strategies. The findings suggest providing support to families of patients with AD through tailored strategies aimed to reshape the dysfunctional coping styles. 
24140109	Impact of the apolipoprotein E polymorphism, age and sex on neurogenesis in mice: pathophysiological relevance for Alzheimer's disease?
Brain Res. 20131016 2014Jan13
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is found in three different forms in humans (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4), and ApoE polymorphism is recognized as a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE is involved in lipid and cholesterol transport, cell repair, and amyloid-Î² deposition and certain studies suggest potential implications in neurogenesis. In this regard, we investigated the possible impact of the three different human ApoE isoforms on neurogenesis. We used ApoE knock-in mice of different ages and sex, and quantified newborn cells in the hippocampus by flow cytometry. Young adult ApoE4 mice (10-12 week-old) from both sexes displayed reduced neurogenesis compared with wild-types and the other genotypes. In addition, young adult ApoE2 female mice showed improved hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation. In older mice (1 year), hippocampal neurogenesis was globally decreased, particularly in females, and the difference between ApoE4 and the other genotypes observed in young animals disappeared for the two sexes, except for aged ApoE3 females. Indeed, a surprising protective effect of the ApoE3 genotype was observed in aged females. Our study highlights the role of ApoE in neurogenesis, and shows for the first time an early inequality between the ApoE genotypes. The reduced neurogenesis observed for the ApoE4 genotype and the improved results obtained in young ApoE2 females support the idea of a difference in the balance between neuronal birth and death modulated by the ApoE polymorphism in young animals. The maintenance of this balance and its modulation can influence pathophysiological mechanisms predisposing to neurodegenerative diseases like AD.  
23583234	Vitamin E and memantine in Alzheimer's disease: clinical trial methods and baseline data.
Alzheimers Dement 20130411 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with both oxidative stress and excessive glutamate activity. A clinical trial was designed to compare the effectiveness of (i) alpha-tocopherol, a vitamin E antioxidant; (ii) memantine (Namenda), an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist; (iii) their combination; and (iv) placebo in delaying clinical progression in AD. The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program initiated a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in August 2007, with enrollment through March 2012 and follow-up continuing through September 2012. Participants with mild-to-moderate AD who were taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor were assigned randomly to 2000 IU/day of alpha-tocopherol, 20 mg/day memantine, 2000 IU/day alpha-tocopherol plus 20 mg/day memantine, or placebo. The primary outcome for the study is the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory. Secondary outcome measures include the Mini-Mental State Examination; the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive portion; the Dependence Scale; the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; and the Caregiver Activity Survey. Patient follow-up ranged from 6 months to 4 years. A total of 613 participants were randomized. The majority of the patients were male (97%) and white (86%), with a mean age of 79 years. The mean Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory score at entry was 57 and the mean Mini-Mental State Examination score at entry wasÂ 21. This large multicenter trial will address the unanswered question of the long-term safety and effectiveness of alpha-tocopherol, memantine, and their combination in patients with mild-to-moderate AD taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The results are expected in earlyÂ 2013. 
23850333	The future of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130711 2014Jan
Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is significantly hampered by the lack of easily accessible biomarkers that can detect disease presence and predict disease risk reliably. Fluid biomarkers of AD currently provide indications of disease stage; however, they are not robust predictors of disease progression or treatment response, and most are measured in cerebrospinal fluid, which limits their applicability. With these aspects in mind, the aim of this article is to underscore the concerted efforts of the Blood-Based Biomarker Interest Group, an international working group of experts in the field. The points addressed include: (1) the major challenges in the development of blood-based biomarkers of AD, including patient heterogeneity, inclusion of the "right" control population, and the blood-brain barrier; (2) the need for a clear definition of the purpose of the individual markers (e.g., prognostic, diagnostic, or monitoring therapeutic efficacy); (3) a critical evaluation of the ongoing biomarker approaches; and (4) highlighting the need for standardization of preanalytical variables and analytical methodologies used by the field.  
23978235	Dual-retrieval models and neurocognitive impairment.
J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 20130826 2014Jan
Advances in dual-retrieval models of recall make it possible to use clinical data to test theoretical hypotheses about mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD), the most common forms of neurocognitive impairment. Hypotheses about the nature of the episodic memory declines in these diseases, about decline versus sparing of specific processes, and about which individuals will become impaired over time can all be rigorously tested. Basic theoretical principles, such as whether recollection and reconstruction are distinct retrieval processes, can also be evaluated. In 3 studies, measurements of recollective retrieval, reconstructive retrieval, and familiarity judgment were extracted from standard clinical instruments, for healthy subjects and for subjects with MCI and AD diagnoses. Differences in reconstructive retrieval consistently distinguished MCI and AD, in nationally representative subject samples as well as in highly educated samples, and recollective retrieval also distinguished them in highly educated samples. Dual-retrieval processes were accurate predictors of future conversion to MCI and AD over periods of 1.5-6 years and were better predictors than the best genetic marker of these conditions (the Îµ4 allele of the APOE genotype). The standard recollection-deficit account of memory declines in MCI and AD was not supported, but the data were consistent with an alternative account that stresses the increasing importance of reconstruction deficits as older adults convert to these diseases. 
24523537	Hsp90 chaperone inhibitor 17-AAG attenuates AÎ²-induced synaptic toxicity and memory impairment.
J. Neurosci.  2014Feb12
The excessive accumulation of soluble amyloid peptides (AÎ²) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly in synaptic dysfunction. The role of the two major chaperone proteins, Hsp70 and Hsp90, in clearing misfolded protein aggregates has been established. Despite their abundant presence in synapses, the role of these chaperones in synapses remains elusive. Here, we report that Hsp90 inhibition by 17-AAG elicited not only a heat shock-like response but also upregulated presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, such as synapsin I, synaptophysin, and PSD95 in neurons. 17-AAG treatment enhanced high-frequency stimulation-evoked LTP and protected neurons from synaptic damage induced by soluble AÎ². In AD transgenic mice, the daily administration of 17-AAG over 7 d resulted in a marked increase in PSD95 expression in hippocampi. 17-AAG treatments in wild-type C57BL/6 mice challenged by soluble AÎ² significantly improved contextual fear memory. Further, we demonstrate that 17-AAG activated synaptic protein expression via transcriptional mechanisms through the heat shock transcription factor HSF1. Together, our findings identify a novel function of Hsp90 inhibition in regulating synaptic plasticity, in addition to the known neuroprotective effects of the chaperones against AÎ² and tau toxicity, thus further supporting the potential of Hsp90 inhibitors in treating neurodegenerative diseases.  
24556009	Targeting the Î² secretase BACE1 for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
Lancet Neurol 20140217 2014Mar
The Î² secretase, widely known as Î²-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), initiates the production of the toxic amyloid Î² (AÎ²) that plays a crucial early part in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. BACE1 is a prime therapeutic target for lowering cerebral AÎ² concentrations in Alzheimer's disease, and clinical development of BACE1 inhibitors is being intensely pursued. Although BACE1 inhibitor drug development has proven challenging, several promising BACE1 inhibitors have recently entered human clinical trials. The safety and efficacy of these drugs are being tested at present in healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease, and will soon be tested in individuals with presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Although hopes are high that BACE1 inhibitors might be efficacious for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease, concerns have been raised about potential mechanism-based side-effects of these drugs. The potential of therapeutic BACE1 inhibition might prove to be a watershed in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  
24685176	Soluble AÎ² oligomers are rapidly sequestered from brain ISF in vivo and bind GM1 ganglioside on cellular membranes.
Neuron 20140327 2014Apr16
Soluble AÎ² oligomers contribute importantly to synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease, but their dynamics in vivo remain unclear. Here, we found that soluble AÎ² oligomers were sequestered from brain interstitial fluid onto brain membranes much more rapidly than nontoxic monomers and were recovered in part as bound to GM1 ganglioside on membranes. AÎ² oligomers bound strongly to GM1 ganglioside, and blocking the sialic acid residue on GM1 decreased oligomer-mediated LTP impairment in mouse hippocampal slices. In a hAPP transgenic mouse model, substantial levels of GM1-bound AÎ²â‚„â‚‚ were recovered from brain membrane fractions. We also detected GM1-bound AÎ² in human CSF, and its levels correlated with AÎ²â‚„â‚‚, suggesting its potential as a biomarker of AÎ²-related membrane dysfunction. Together, these findings highlight a mechanism whereby hydrophobic AÎ² oligomers become sequestered onto GM1 ganglioside and presumably other lipids on neuronal membranes, where they may induce progressive functional and structural changes. 
24807367	[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for treatment of Alzheimer's disease].
Brain Nerve  2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and is the commonest cause of dementia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were developed under the cholinergic hypothesis of AD. Therapeutic strategies with these drugs aimed to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in specific parts of the brain, and to improve the clinical symptoms of AD. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are commonly used AChEIs in pharmacotherapy for AD, slowing the progression and controlling the symptoms of AD. Although these drugs have different pharmacological properties, there is no clear evidence of differences between them with respect to efficacy. It is possible to adapt AChEIs for the pharmacotherapy of other conditions, such as vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Down syndrome. 
24849862	Advancing research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease: the IWG-2 criteria.
Lancet Neurol  2014Jun
In the past 8 years, both the International Working Group (IWG) and the US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association have contributed criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that better define clinical phenotypes and integrate biomarkers into the diagnostic process, covering the full staging of the disease. This Position Paper considers the strengths and limitations of the IWG research diagnostic criteria and proposes advances to improve the diagnostic framework. On the basis of these refinements, the diagnosis of AD can be simplified, requiring the presence of an appropriate clinical AD phenotype (typical or atypical) and a pathophysiological biomarker consistent with the presence of Alzheimer's pathology. We propose that downstream topographical biomarkers of the disease, such as volumetric MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, might better serve in the measurement and monitoring of the course of disease. This paper also elaborates on the specific diagnostic criteria for atypical forms of AD, for mixed AD, and for the preclinical states of AD.  
24899351	[Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS)].
Brain Nerve  2014Jun
The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) started in 1991 as part of an agreement between the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the University of California, San Diego, is a major clinical activity for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). As part of the NIA Division, the ADCS supports all activities for AD treatment, including the discovery and evaluation of new diagnostic methods, drugs, and devices for patients with AD, as well as the prevention of AD. 
24733660	Swiss cheese striatum: clinical implications.
JAMA Neurol  2014Jun
Markedly enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces throughout the striatum appear occasionally on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the elderly, and this type of striatum is known as the Swiss cheese striatum (SCS); however, its clinical impact is unknown. To determine the clinical features associated with SCS detected on MRI scans. A blinded, retrospective case-control study using medical records from 2000 to 2007 obtained from an MRI database at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, of residents 40 years of age or older of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who had extensive Mayo Clinic medical records and MRI reports suggestive of SCS. Cases with a severe form of SCS (nâ€‰=â€‰27) were randomly selected for comparison with age-, sex-, and examination year-matched controls (nâ€‰=â€‰52) with a minimal form of SCS or no SCS. Magnetic resonance imaging. Associations of clinical and imaging features with the presence of a severe form of SCS. Medical records were reviewed for clinical features such as parkinsonism, dementia, and vascular risk factors. The MRI scans were visually scored for degree of leukoaraiosis, central atrophy, and cortical atrophy. No significant differences were found between those with a severe form of SCS and controls in rates of parkinsonism (19% vs 17%; odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.28-4.16]) or dementia of any type (30% vs 21%; odds ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 0.48-5.13]). Vascular risk factors were not significantly different between groups. Swiss cheese striatum correlated with degree of leukoaraiosis (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001). Potential associations with visualized cortical atrophy (Pâ€‰=â€‰.01), nonobstructive urinary incontinence (18.5% vs 3.9%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.04), and syncope (37% vs 9.6%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01) did not hold up after correction for the false discovery rate. Our study suggests that marked cribriform change in the striatum was not associated with the development of extrapyramidal clinical disorders, including parkinsonism. The association of SCS with leukoaraiosis suggests that it is part of a more generalized cerebrovascular process. Skepticism is called for when attributing clinical symptoms to this MRI finding. 
24756204	Expanded C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat in depressive pseudodementia.
JAMA Neurol  2014Jun
Expanded hexanucleotide repeats in C9ORF72 are a common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Repeat expansions have also been detected infrequently in other disorders, including Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and parkinsonian disorders. A consecutive series of 31 cases from the brain bank for neurodegenerative disorders at Mayo Clinic was screened to assess the incidence of the expanded C9ORF72 repeat in cases of depressive pseudodementia. The presence of the hexanucleotide repeat was established using immunohistochemistry with a highly disease-specific antibody (C9RANT), and was further validated in carriers using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting. Two individuals harbored the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. Both patients were men with refractory depression. One patient experienced drug-induced parkinsonism and sudden-onset dementia, while the other patient had a more insidious disease course suspected to be Alzheimer disease. This report increases the range of clinicopathologic presentations of C9ORF72 expanded hexanucleotide repeat to include psychiatric disorders such as depressive pseudodementia. 
24756381	Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and cognitive function in people without cognitive impairment from across the adult life span.
JAMA Neurol  2014Jun
Age-related cognitive decline among older individuals with normal cognition is a complex trait that potentially derives from processes of aging, inherited vulnerabilities, environmental factors, and common latent diseases that can progress to cause dementia, such as Alzheimer disease and vascular brain injury. To use cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to gain insight into this complex trait. Secondary analyses of an academic multicenter cross-sectional (nâ€‰=â€‰315) and longitudinal (nâ€‰=â€‰158) study of 5 neuropsychological tests (Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Trail Making Test Parts A and B, and Category Fluency) in cognitively normal individuals aged 21 to 100 years. To investigate the association of these cognitive function test results with age, sex, educational level, inheritance of the Îµ4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene, and CSF concentrations of Î²-amyloid 42 (AÎ²42) and tau (biomarkers of Alzheimer disease) as well as F2-isoprostanes (measures of free radical injury). Age and educational level were broadly predictive of cross-sectional cognitive performance; of the genetic and CSF measures, only greater CSF F2-isoprostane concentration was significantly associated with poorer executive function (adjusted R2 â‰¤0.31). Longitudinal measures of cognitive abilities, except Category Fluency, also were associated broadly with age; of the genetic and CSF measures, only lower baseline CSF AÎ²42 concentration was associated with longitudinal measures of immediate and delayed recall (marginal R2 â‰¤0.31). Our results suggest that age and educational level accounted for a substantial minority of variance in cross-sectional or longitudinal cognitive test performance in this large group of cognitively normal adults. Latent Alzheimer disease and other diseases that produce free radical injury, such as vascular brain injury, accounted for a small amount of variation in cognitive test performance across the adult human life span. Additional genetic and environmental factors likely contribute substantially to age-related cognitive decline. 
24781145	Emerging Î²-amyloid pathology and accelerated cortical atrophy.
JAMA Neurol  2014Jun
The effect of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) accumulation on regional structural brain changes in early stages of Alzheimer disease (AD) is not well understood. To test the hypothesis that the development of AÎ² pathology is related to increased regional atrophy in the brains of cognitively normal (CN) persons. Longitudinal clinicobiomarker cohort study involving 47 CN control subjects and 15 patients with AD dementia. All participants underwent repeated cerebrospinal fluid AÎ²42 and structural magnetic resonance imaging measurements for up to 4 years. Cognitively normal controls were classified using the longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid AÎ²42 data and included 13 stable AÎ² negative (normal baseline AÎ²42 levels, with less than the median reduction over time), 13 declining AÎ² negative (normal baseline AÎ²42 levels, with greater than the median reduction over time), and 21 AÎ² positive (pathologic baseline AÎ²42 levels). All 15 patients with AD dementia were AÎ² positive. Group effects on regional gray matter volumes at baseline and over time, tested by linear mixed-effects models. Baseline gray matter volumes were similar among the CN AÎ² groups, but atrophy rates were increased in frontoparietal regions in the declining AÎ²-negative and AÎ²-positive groups and in amygdala and temporal regions in the AÎ²-positive group. AÎ²-positive patients with AD dementia had further increased atrophy rates in hippocampus and temporal and cingulate regions. Emerging AÎ² pathology is coupled to increased frontoparietal (but not temporal) atrophy rates. Atrophy rates peak early in frontoparietal regions but accelerate in hippocampus, temporal, and cingulate regions as the disease progresses to dementia. Early-stage AÎ² pathology may have mild effects on local frontoparietal cortical integrity while effects in temporal regions appear later and accelerate, leading to the atrophy pattern typically seen in AD. 
24995291	Correlation between behavioural and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer type dementia and plasma homocysteine concentration.
Biomed Res Int 20140604 2014
The relationship between plasma homocysteine and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) has not been specifically investigated in previous research. In this study, we compared plasma homocysteine (Hcy) among 40 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with BPSD, 37 AD patients without BPSD, and 39 healthy controls. Our results evidenced that the plasma homocysteine levels in AD patients with BPSD and without BPSD were higher than healthy controls and that the plasma homocysteine concentration in AD patients with BPSD was the highest among the three groups. Significant correlation between plasma homocysteine concentration and cognitive decline and duration of dementia was observed, but there was no correlation between BPSD and cognitive dysfunction or duration of dementia. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that BPSD were associated with plasma homocysteine concentration in Alzheimer's dementia, and the results supported that hyperhomocysteine may take part in the pathogenesis of BPSD.  
24995314	A pilot study evaluating the contribution of SLC19A1 (RFC-1) 80G&gt;a polymorphism to Alzheimer's disease in Italian Caucasians.
Biomed Res Int 20140605 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the primary form of dementia in the elderly. Polymorphisms of genes involved in folate metabolism have been frequently suggested as risk factors for sporadic AD. A common c.80G&gt;A polymorphism (rs1051266) in the gene coding for the reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1 gene, commonly known as RFC-1 gene) was investigated as AD risk factor in Asian populations, yielding conflicting results. We screened a Caucasian population of Italian origin composed of 192 sporadic AD patients and 186 healthy matched controls, for the presence of the RFC-1 c.80G&gt;A polymorphism, and searched for correlation with circulating levels of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12. No difference in the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies was observed between AD patients and controls. No correlation was observed among the genotypes generated by the RFC-1 c.80G&gt;A polymorphism and circulating levels of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 either in the whole cohort of subjects or after stratification into clinical subtypes. Present results do not support a role for the RFC-1 c.80G&gt;A polymorphism as independent risk factor for sporadic AD in Italian Caucasians. 
24992504	Genetic inhibition of phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2Î± does not block AÎ²-dependent elevation of BACE1 and APP levels or reduce amyloid pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140703 2014
Î²-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) initiates the production of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²), the major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 is elevated âˆ¼2-3 fold in AD brain and is concentrated in dystrophic neurites near plaques, suggesting BACE1 elevation is AÎ²-dependent. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2Î± de-represses translation of BACE1 mRNA following stress such as energy deprivation. We hypothesized that stress induced by AÎ² might increase BACE1 levels by the same translational mechanism involving eIF2Î± phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we used three different genetic strategies to determine the effects of reducing eIF2Î± phosphorylation on AÎ²-dependent BACE1 elevation in vitro and in vivo: 1) a two-vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) system to express constitutively active GADD34, the regulatory subunit of PP1c eIF2Î± phosphatase; 2) a non-phosphorylatable eIF2Î± S51A knockin mutation; 3) a BACE1-YFP transgene lacking the BACE1 mRNA 5' untranslated region (UTR) required for eIF2Î± translational regulation. The first two strategies were used in primary neurons and 5XFAD transgenic mice, while the third strategy was employed only in 5XFAD mice. Despite very effective reduction of eIF2Î± phosphorylation in both primary neurons and 5XFAD brains, or elimination of eIF2Î±-mediated regulation of BACE1-YFP mRNA translation in 5XFAD brains, AÎ²-dependent BACE1 elevation was not decreased. Additionally, robust inhibition of eIF2Î± phosphorylation did not block AÎ²-dependent APP elevation in primary neurons, nor did it reduce amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mice. We conclude that amyloid-associated BACE1 elevation is not caused by translational de-repression via eIF2Î± phosphorylation, but instead appears to involve a post-translational mechanism. These definitive genetic results exclude a role for eIF2Î± phosphorylation in AÎ²-dependent BACE1 and APP elevation. We suggest a vicious pathogenic cycle wherein AÎ²42 toxicity induces peri-plaque BACE1 and APP accumulation in dystrophic neurites leading to exacerbated AÎ² production and plaque progression.  
24786328	Olfactory delayed matching to sample performance in mice: sex differences in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Behav. Brain Res. 20140428 2014Aug15
While olfactory delayed matching-to-sample tasks have been used to assess working memory in rats, no such tasks have been tested in mice. Olfactory delayed matching-to-sample learning was assessed in male and female 5XFAD mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease, and their wildtype (B6SJL F1) littermates at 6-7 months of age using an operant olfactometer. All 5XFAD and wildtype mice were able to learn the delayed olfactory matching-to-sample task at 2 and 5s delays. Fewer mice learned with a 10s delay and only one mouse learned with a 30s delay. Female mice showed higher levels of performance on the delayed matching-to-sample task than males, indicative of better working memory. These results demonstrate for the first time that mice are able to learn an olfactory delayed matching to sample task.  
24999480	Evaluation of plant phenolic metabolites as a source of Alzheimer's drug leads.
Biomed Res Int 20140529 2014
Epidemiological studies have proven an association between consumption of polyphenols and prevention of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid beta plaques. The aim of this study is pharmacological screening of the aqueous alcohol extract of Markhamia platycalyx leaves, Schotia brachypetala leaves and stalks, and piceatannol compared to aqueous alcohol extract of Camellia sinensis leaves as potential Alzheimer's disease drugs. LC-HRESI(-ve)-MS(n) was performed to identify phenolics' profile of Schotia brachypetala stalks aqueous alcohol extract and revealed ten phenolic compounds as first report: daidzein, naringin, procyanidin isomers, procyanidin dimer gallate, quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin hexose gallic acid, quercetin hexose protocatechuic acid, and ellagic acid. Alzheimer's disease was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Adult male Swiss albino mice were divided into groups of 8-10 mice each receiving treatment for six days. In vivo behavioral tests (Y maze and object recognition) and in vitro estimation of amyloid beta 42 by ELISA showed significant differences between results of treated and nontreated animals.  
24889041	PERK mediates eIF2Î± phosphorylation responsible for BACE1 elevation, CREB dysfunction and neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140502 2014Oct
Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2Î± (eIF2Î±) may induce synaptic failure and neurodegeneration through persistent translational inhibition of global protein synthesis. However, elevated phospho-eIF2Î± also paradoxically causes translational activation of a subset of messenger RNAs such as the Î²-secretase enzyme, Î²-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) repressor, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Therefore, we tested whether genetic reduction of the eIF2Î± kinase PERK may prevent these deleterious events and mitigate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology and cognitive impairments in the 5XFAD mouse model. PERK haploinsufficiency blocked overactivation of the PERK-eIF2Î± pathway, as evidenced by significant reductions in phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2Î±, in 5XFAD mice. PERK haploinsufficiency was sufficient to rescue memory deficits and cholinergic neurodegeneration in this AD model. Notably, PERK haploinsufficiency also prevented BACE1 elevations, resulting in reduced levels of amyloid-Î² peptides and plaque burden in 5XFAD mice. Moreover, CREB dysfunction was restored in PERK(+/-)Â·5XFAD mice concomitant with reversal of ATF4 upregulation. Together, these findings suggest that PERK may be a disease-modifying therapeutic target to prevent multiple memory-disrupting mechanisms associated with AD.  
24910393	Amyloid-Î² diurnal pattern: possible role of sleep in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140515 2014Sep
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline that is a growing public health crisis with a prevalence projected to more than double in the next 20Â years. Sleep is frequently impaired in individuals with AD. Further, recent studies have linked numerous age-related sleep disturbances such as poor sleep efficiency and sleep apnea, to future risk of cognitive impairment. Aggregation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) into extracellular plaques in the brain is a key step in AD pathogenesis and likely begins 20Â years before the onset of dementia. AÎ² concentrations in both humans and mouse models show AÎ² concentrations rise during wakefulness and fall during sleep, that is, an AÎ² diurnal pattern. There is evidence in animal models that changes in sleep time alter AÎ² deposition, suggesting that sleep may play a role in AD pathogenesis. A hypothetical model for the role of sleep and the AÎ² diurnal pattern in AD pathogenesis is proposed.  
24913894	Low-copper diet as a preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140515 2014Sep
Copper is an essential element, and either a copper deficiency or excess can be life threatening. Recent studies have indicated that alteration of copper metabolism is one of the pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In light of these findings, many researchers have proposed preventive strategies to reduce AD risk. Because the general population comes in contact with copper mainly through dietary intake, that is, food 75% and drinking water 25%, a low-copper diet can reduce the risk of AD in individuals with an altered copper metabolism. We suggest that a diet-gene interplay is at the basis of the "copper phenotype" of sporadic AD. Herein, we describe the pathways regulating copper homeostasis, the adverse sequelae related to its derangements, the pathogenic mechanism of the AD copper phenotype, indications for a low-copper diet, and future perspectives to improve this preventive strategy.  
24913896	Dietary and lifestyle guidelines for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140514 2014Sep
Risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is increased by older age, genetic factors, and several medical risk factors. Studies have also suggested that dietary and lifestyle factors may influence risk, raising the possibility that preventive strategies may be effective. This body of research is incomplete. However, because the most scientifically supported lifestyle factors for Alzheimer's disease are known factors for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, it is reasonable to provide preliminary guidance to help individuals who wish to reduce their risk. At the International Conference on Nutrition and the Brain, Washington, DC, July 19-20, 2013, speakers were asked to comment on possible guidelines for Alzheimer's disease prevention, with an aim of developing a set of practical, albeit preliminary, steps to be recommended to members of the public. From this discussion, 7 guidelines emerged related to healthful diet and exercise habits.  
24973118	Apolipoprotein E and lipid homeostasis in the etiology and treatment of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140515 2014Sep
The discovery that the apolipoprotein E (apoE) Îµ4 allele is genetically linked to both sporadic and familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) raises the possibility that a dysfunction of the lipid transport system could seriously affect lipid homeostasis in the brain of AD subjects. The presence of the Îµ4 allele has been associated with lower levels of apoE in both serum and brain tissues of normal and AD subjects. In an attempt to reverse the apoE deficit in AD, we identified and characterized several apoE inducer agents using a low-throughput inÂ vitro screening assay. The most promising of these compounds is called probucol. Administration of probucol, an old cholesterol-lowering drug, in a pilot trial in mild-to-moderate sporadic AD led to a significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) apoE levels and a decrease in CSF in both phosphorylated tau 181 and beta-amyloid 1-42 concentrations without significant modifications of lipid hydroperoxide levels.  
24837199	[Psychoneuroimmunological predictors for burden in older caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease].
Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol 20140514 2014 Jul-Aug
The responsibility of giving care to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result in health changes in the older caregiver. It is important to explore the factors which influence the presence of care burden and to create strategies to face this condition. In this context, the aims of present study were to investigate the relationships between psychoneuroimmunological parameters and determine the predictors to burden in older caregivers of patients with AD. A total of 30 AD older caregivers participating in the Â«Cognitive and Functional Kinesiotherapy Program in Elderly with Alzheimer's diseaseÂ«(PRO-CDA)Â», de Rio Claro, SP-Brazil, were submitted to an assessment protocol to evaluate the psychoneuroimmunological parameters. A descriptive statistical analysis, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regressions were performed. The mean age of caregivers was 71.3 (Â±9.3), and predominantly are first-grade relatives. The caregiver burden was associated with depressive symptoms (r=0.60, P&lt;.001), caregiver distress (r=0.68, P&lt;.001), and neuropsychiatric disorders of AD patients (r=0.53, P&lt;.001). The multiple regression analysis confirmed depressive symptoms and neuropsychiatric disturbances as predictors of caregiver burden. Caregiver burden is associated with, and influenced by parameters related to the caregiver psychological suffering and to characteristics inherent to AD. Thus, it is important to find strategies and implement non-pharmacological programs to provide support to older caregivers, and to assist in the treatment of patients with AD, in order to improve the integral health of this population. 
24880524	[Effects of a neuropsychology program based on mindfulness on Alzheimer's disease: randomized double-blind clinical study].
Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol 20140528 2014 Jul-Aug
The purpose of this research was to assess effects of a mindfulness based neuropsychological intervention on the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease. A two year randomized and double blind clinical trial was conducted on 127 probable Alzheimer's disease patients, according to NINCDS-ADRDA scale. Patients were grouped into three experimental groups (cognitive stimulation, progressive muscular relaxation, and mindfulness) plus a control group. All participants were receiving donepezil. Cognitive skills were assessed with CAMCOG and MMSE, functional area with RDRS-2, and NPI was used for psychopathology screening. Three treatment sessions per week were carried out for two years, and follow up measurements were taken every six months. The global cognitive function, functionality and behavioral disorders measurements indicated that patients from the experimental group based on mindfulness were stable during the two years, while patients from the control group, as well as the other experimental groups, showed a mild but significant worsening of their mental capacities. The mindfulness based neuropsychological program showed better cognitive and functional stability, as well as significant improvement in the psychopathological condition of mild to moderate Alzheimer' patients. These results support the idea that a mindfulness based intervention can produce a clinically relevant improvement in the treatment of dementia. More research is needed to confirm these data. 
25030513	Potential for primary prevention of Alzheimer's disease: an analysis of population-based data.
Lancet Neurol  2014Aug
Recent estimates suggesting that over half of Alzheimer's disease burden worldwide might be attributed to potentially modifiable risk factors do not take into account risk-factor non-independence. We aimed to provide specific estimates of preventive potential by accounting for the association between risk factors. Using relative risks from existing meta-analyses, we estimated the population-attributable risk (PAR) of Alzheimer's disease worldwide and in the USA, Europe, and the UK for seven potentially modifiable risk factors that have consistent evidence of an association with the disease (diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, physical inactivity, depression, smoking, and low educational attainment). The combined PAR associated with the risk factors was calculated using data from the Health Survey for England 2006 to estimate and adjust for the association between risk factors. The potential of risk factor reduction was assessed by examining the combined effect of relative reductions of 10% and 20% per decade for each of the seven risk factors on projections for Alzheimer's disease cases to 2050. Worldwide, the highest estimated PAR was for low educational attainment (19Â·1%, 95% CI 12Â·3-25Â·6). The highest estimated PAR was for physical inactivity in the USA (21Â·0%, 95% CI 5Â·8-36Â·6), Europe (20Â·3%, 5Â·6-35Â·6), and the UK (21Â·8%, 6Â·1-37Â·7). Assuming independence, the combined worldwide PAR for the seven risk factors was 49Â·4% (95% CI 25Â·7-68Â·4), which equates to 16Â·8 million attributable cases (95% CI 8Â·7-23Â·2 million) of 33Â·9 million cases. However, after adjustment for the association between the risk factors, the estimate reduced to 28Â·2% (95% CI 14Â·2-41Â·5), which equates to 9Â·6 million attributable cases (95% CI 4Â·8-14Â·1 million) of 33Â·9 million cases. Combined PAR estimates were about 30% for the USA, Europe, and the UK. Assuming a causal relation and intervention at the correct age for prevention, relative reductions of 10% per decade in the prevalence of each of the seven risk factors could reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in 2050 by 8Â·3% worldwide. After accounting for non-independence between risk factors, around a third of Alzheimer's diseases cases worldwide might be attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors. Alzheimer's disease incidence might be reduced through improved access to education and use of effective methods targeted at reducing the prevalence of vascular risk factors (eg, physical inactivity, smoking, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, and diabetes) and depression.

25110557	Protective effects of Acanthopanax divaricatus extract in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Nutr Res Pract 20140728 2014Aug
Acanthopanax divaricatus var. albeofructus (ADA) extract has been reported to have anti-oxidant, immunomodulatory, and anti-mutagenic activity. We investigated the effects of ADA extract on two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD); intracerebroventricular injection of Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²) and amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1)-transgenic mice. Intra-gastric administration of ADA stem extract (0.25 g/kg, every 12 hrs started from one day prior to injection of AÎ²1-42 until evaluation) effectively blocked AÎ²1-42-induced impairment in passive avoidance performance, and AÎ²1-42-induced increase in immunoreactivities of glial fibrillary acidic protein and interleukin (IL)-1Î± in the hippocampus. In addition, it alleviated the AÎ²1-42-induced decrease in acetylcholine and increase in malondialdehyde levels in the cortex. In APP/PS1-transgenic mice, chronic oral administration of ADA stem extract (0.1 or 0.5 g/kg/day for six months from the age of six to 12 months) resulted in significantly enhanced performance of the novel-object recognition task, and reduced amyloid deposition and IL-1Î² in the brain. The results of this study suggest that ADA stem extract may be useful for prevention and treatment of AD. 
24393284	Open questions for Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140107 2014
Perhaps more definitively than any other class of novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy, pre-clinical studies in mouse models of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) deposition have established the disease-modifying potential of anti-AÎ² immunotherapy. Despite disappointing results to date from anti-AÎ² immunotherapy therapeutic trials, there is continued hope that such immunotherapies, especially if used in the preclinical stages, could prove to be the first disease-modifying therapies available for AD. The general optimism that AÎ²-targeting and emerging tau-targeting immunotherapies may prove to be disease modifying is tempered by many unanswered questions regarding these therapeutic approaches, including but not limited to i) lack of precise understanding of mechanisms of action, ii) the factors that regulate antibody exposure in the brain, iii) the optimal target epitope, and iv) the mechanisms underlying side effects. In this review I discuss how answering these and other questions could increase the likelihood of therapeutic success. As passive immunotherapies are also likely to be extremely expensive, I also raise questions relating to cost-benefit of biologic-based therapies for AD that could limit future impact of these therapies by limiting access due to economic constraints.  
24735568	Performance on a pattern separation task by Alzheimer's patients shows possible links between disrupted dentate gyrus activity and apolipoprotein E âˆˆ4 status and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-Î²42 levels.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140415 2014
Emerging evidence suggests that decreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis represents an early critical event in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In mice, adult neurogenesis is reduced by knock-in alleles for human apolipoprotein E (ApoE) âˆˆ4. Decreased dentate gyrus (DG) neural progenitor cells proliferation has been observed in the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD); this reduction being directly associated with the presence of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and an increase in the number of AÎ²-containing neurons in the hippocampus. Cognitive tasks involving difficult pattern separations have been shown to reflect DG activity and thus potentially neurogenesis in both animals and man. This study involved the administration of a pattern separation paradigm to Alzheimer's patients to investigate relationships between task performance and both ApoE status and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AÎ²42 levels. The CDR System pattern separation task involves the presentation of pictures that must later be discriminated from closely similar pictures. This paper presents pattern separation data from 66 mild to moderate AD patients, of which 50 were genotyped and 65 in whom CSF AÎ²42 was measured. ApoE âˆˆ4 homozygotes were not compromised on the easy pattern separations compared with the other patients, but they were statistically significantly poorer at the difficult separations. In all patients CSF AÎ²42 correlated significantly with the ability to make the difficult discriminations, but not easier discriminations. Pattern separation speed correlated negatively with CSF AÎ²42, and thus the association was not due to increased impulsivity. These are, to our knowledge, the first human pattern separation data to suggest a possible genetic link to poor hippocampal neurogenesis in AD, as well as a relationship to AÎ²42. Therapies which target neurogenesis may thus be useful in preventing the early stages of AD, notably in ApoE âˆˆ4 homocygotes. 
24716469	Modulation of Î²-amyloid by a single dose of GSK933776 in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease: a phase I study.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140409 2014
In this study, we evaluated the safety and pharmacodynamic effects of the Fc-inactivated anti-Î²-amyloid (anti-AÎ²) monoclonal antibody GSK933776 in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. AÎ² and tau levels were investigated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the relationship between AÎ² levels and AÎ² modulation in plasma was explored. The feasibility of a continuous sampling method using a lumbar catheter was assessed. This trial was a phase I, open-label, uncontrolled, single-dose, exploratory experimental medicine study of intravenous GSK933776 at doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg (nâ€‰=â€‰6/group). The time course of plasma and CSF concentrations of GSK933776 and AÎ² was assessed. Sample size was based on feasibility, and no formal statistical analyses were performed. Following administration of GSK933776 at doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, there were decreases from baseline in CSF AÎ²1-42 (from 0 to 12 hours) by 22.8 pg/ml (6.2%), 43.5 pg/ml (9.2%) and 60.5 pg/ml (12.5%), respectively. Plasma concentrations of total AÎ²18-35 and AÎ²4228-42 increased immediately after infusion and CSF tau concentration increased slightly, but did not significantly change, following administration of all doses of GSK933776. Pharmacokinetics confirmed the presence of GSK933776 in the CSF, which exhibited a dose-response relationship. One patient underwent minor surgery without sequelae following a ruptured lumbar catheter. GSK933776 demonstrated pharmacological activity and target engagement in CSF and plasma, and the continuous sampling method via a catheter successfully assessed the AÎ² changes following single-dose administration of GSK933776.

24684749	TMEM106B expression is reduced in Alzheimer's disease brains.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140331 2014
TMEM106B is a transmembrane glycoprotein of unknown function located within endosome/lysosome compartments expressed ubiquitously in various cell types. Previously, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a significant association of TMEM106B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with development of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43)-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP), particularly in the patients exhibiting the progranulin (PGRN) gene (GRN) mutations. Recent studies indicate that TMEM106B plays a pathological role in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, at present, the precise levels of TMEM106B expression in AD brains remain unknown. By quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (qPCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry, we studied TMEM106B and PGRN expression levels in a series of AD and control brains, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and non-neurological cases. In AD brains, TMEM106B mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced, whereas PGRN mRNA levels were elevated, compared with the levels in non-AD brains. In all brains, TMEM106B was expressed in the majority of cortical neurons, hippocampal neurons, and some populations of oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes and microglia with the location in the cytoplasm. In AD brains, surviving neurons expressed intense TMEM106B immunoreactivity, while senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and the perivascular neuropil, almost devoid of TMEM106B, intensely expressed PGRN. We found an inverse relationship between TMEM106B (downregulation) and PGRN (upregulation) expression levels in AD brains, suggesting a key role of TMEM106B in the pathological processes of AD. 
25116835	Plasma DYRK1A as a novel risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
Transl Psychiatry 20140812 2014
To determine whether apparent involvement of DYRK1A in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology makes it a candidate plasma biomarker for diagnosis, we developed a method to quantify plasma DYRK1A by immunoblot in transgenic mouse models having different gene dosages of Dyrk1a, and, consequently, different relative protein expression. Then, we measured plasma DYRK1A levels in 26 patients with biologically confirmed AD and 25 controls (negative amyloid imaging available on 13). DYRK1A was detected in transgenic mouse brain and plasma samples, and relative levels of DYRK1A correlated with the gene copy number. In plasma from AD patients, DYRK1A levels were significantly lower compared with controls (P&lt;0.0001). Results were similar when we compared AD patients with the subgroup of controls confirmed by negative amyloid imaging. In a subgroup of patients with early AD (CDR=0.5), lower DYRK1A expression was confirmed. In contrast, no difference was found in levels of DYRK1B, the closest relative of DYRK1A, between AD patients and controls. Further, AD patients exhibited a positive correlation between plasma DYRK1A levels and cerebrospinal fluid tau and phosphorylated-tau proteins, but no correlation with amyloid-Î²42 levels and Pittsburgh compound B cortical binding. DYRK1A levels detected in lymphoblastoid cell lines from AD patients were also lower when compared with cells from age-matched controls. These findings suggest that reduced DYRK1A expression might be a novel plasma risk factor for AD.  
25120223	Disruption of resting functional connectivity in Alzheimer's patients and at-risk subjects.
Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep  2014Oct
The resting brain exhibits continuous intrinsic activity, which is correlated between groups of regions forming resting state networks. Evaluating resting connectivity is a popular approach for studying brain diseases. Several hundred studies are now available that address integrity of resting connectivity in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as preclinical at-risk subjects. Most studies focus on the default mode network, a system of specific brain areas showing strong connected resting activity that attenuates during goal-directed behavior. The extent of intrinsic brain activity tends to be strongly correlated with cognitive processes and is specifically disrupted in AD and MCI patients and at-risk subjects, with changes seeming to evolve during the transition between the disease stages. In this study, we review the current findings in default mode network and other resting state network studies in AD and MCI patients and at-risk subjects as assessed by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging.  
25124077	Study of the usability of spaced retrieval exercise using mobile devices for Alzheimer's disease rehabilitation.
JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 20140814 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out the simplest daily tasks. Recent studies showed that people with AD might actually benefit from physical exercises and rehabilitation processes. Studies show that rehabilitation would also add value in making the day for an individual with AD a little less foggy, frustrating, isolated, and stressful for as long as possible. The focus of our work was to explore the use of modern mobile technology to enable people with AD to improve their abilities to perform activities of daily living, and hence to promote independence and participation in social activities. Our work also aimed at reducing the burden on caregivers by increasing the AD patients' sense of competence and ability to handle behavior problems. We developed ADcope, an integrated app that includes several modules that targeted individuals with AD, using mobile devices. We have developed two different user interfaces: text-based and graphic-based. To evaluate the usability of the app, 10 participants with early stages of AD were asked to run the two user interfaces of the spaced retrieval memory exercise using a tablet mobile device. We selected 10 participants with early stages of AD (average age: 75 years; 6/10, 60% males, 4/10, 40% females). The average elapsed time per question between the text-based task (14.04 seconds) and the graphic-based task (12.89 seconds) was significantly different (P=.047). There was also a significant difference (P&lt;.001) between the average correct answer score between the text-based task (7.60/10) and the graphic-based task (8.30/10), and between the text-based task (31.50/100) and the graphic-based task (27.20/100; P&lt;.001). Correlation analysis for the graphic-based task showed that the average elapsed time per question and the workload score were negatively correlated (-.93, and -.79, respectively) to the participants' performance (P&lt;.001 and P=.006, respectively). We found that people with early stages of AD used mobile devices successfully without any prior experience in using such devices. Participants' measured workload scores were low and posttask satisfaction in fulfilling the required task was conceivable. Results indicate better performance, less workload, and better response time for the graphic-based task compared with the text-based task. 
24175580	Mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width in vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Platelets 20131008 2014
Abstract Activated platelets play a substantial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and atherothrombosis. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is an early marker of platelet activation, which is linked to a variety of pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory diseases. This study is to examine the association between platelet indices and vascular dementia (VaD) and AD. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the levels of platelet count, MPV, and platelet distribution width (PDW) in 150 VaD patients, 110 AD patients, and 150 non-demented controls. MPV and PDW were significantly lower in patients with VaD and AD as compared with controls. The decrease in PDW for AD patients as compared with VaD patients was also significant (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). In addition, there was a positive correlation between Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and MPV and PDW, after adjusting confounding factors (râ€‰=â€‰0.532 for MPV and râ€‰=â€‰0.425 for PDW, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001 for both). Multivariate regression analysis showed that MPV and PDW were significantly associated with MMSE (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.366 for MPV and Î²â€‰=â€‰0.273 for PDW, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001 for both). In conclusion, MPV and PDW were both decreased in VaD and AD. PDW levels were significantly lower in AD as compared to those in VaD. Our findings suggest that PDW in combination with MMSE scores could be potential indicators for distinguishing VaD from AD.  
24297556	Joint association discovery and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by supervised heterogeneous multiview learning.
Pac Symp Biocomput  2014
A key step for Alzheimer's disease (AD) study is to identify associations between genetic variations and intermediate phenotypes (e.g., brain structures). At the same time, it is crucial to develop a noninvasive means for AD diagnosis. Although these two tasks-association discovery and disease diagnosis-have been treated separately by a variety of approaches, they are tightly coupled due to their common biological basis. We hypothesize that the two tasks can potentially benefit each other by a joint analysis, because (i) the association study discovers correlated biomarkers from different data sources, which may help improve diagnosis accuracy, and (ii) the disease status may help identify disease-sensitive associations between genetic variations and MRI features. Based on this hypothesis, we present a new sparse Bayesian approach for joint association study and disease diagnosis. In this approach, common latent features are extracted from different data sources based on sparse projection matrices and used to predict multiple disease severity levels based on Gaussian process ordinal regression; in return, the disease status is used to guide the discovery of relationships between the data sources. The sparse projection matrices not only reveal the associations but also select groups of biomarkers related to AD. To learn the model from data, we develop an efficient variational expectation maximization algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves higher accuracy in both predicting ordinal labels and discovering associations between data sources than alternative methods. We apply our approach to an imaging genetics dataset of AD. Our joint analysis approach not only identifies meaningful and interesting associations between genetic variations, brain structures, and AD status, but also achieves significantly higher accuracy for predicting ordinal AD stages than the competing methods.  
24384308	Lexical factors and cerebral regions influencing verbal fluency performance in MCI.
Neuropsychologia 20131230 2014Feb
To evaluate assumptions regarding semantic (noun), verb, and letter fluency in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) using novel techniques for measuring word similarity in fluency lists and a region of interest (ROI) analysis of gray matter correlates. Fifty-eight individuals with normal cognition (NC, n=25), MCI (n=23), or AD (n=10) underwent neuropsychological tests, including 10 verbal fluency tasks (three letter tasks [F, A, S], six noun categories [animals, water creatures, fruits and vegetables, tools, vehicles, boats], and verbs). All pairs of words generated by each participant on each task were compared in terms of semantic (meaning), orthographic (spelling), and phonemic (pronunciation) similarity. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to determine which lexical factors were predictive of word adjacency within the lists. Associations between each fluency raw score and gray matter volumes in sixteen ROIs were identified by means of multiple linear regression. We evaluated causal models for both types of analyses to specify the contributions of diagnosis and various mediator variables to the outcomes of word adjacency and fluency raw score. Semantic similarity between words emerged as the strongest predictor of word adjacency for all fluency tasks, including the letter fluency tasks. Semantic similarity mediated the effect of cognitive impairment on word adjacency only for three fluency tasks employing a biological cue. Orthographic similarity was predictive of word adjacency for the A and S tasks, while phonemic similarity was predictive only for the S task and one semantic task (vehicles). The ROI analysis revealed different patterns of correlations among the various fluency tasks, with the most common associations in the right lower temporal and bilateral dorsal frontal regions. Following correction with gray matter volumes from the opposite hemisphere, significant associations persisted for animals, vehicles, and a composite nouns score in the left inferior frontal gyrus, but for letter A, letter S, and a composite FAS score in the right inferior frontal gyrus. These regressions also revealed a lateralized association of the left subcortical nuclei with all letter fluency scores and fruits and vegetables fluency, and an association of the right lower temporal ROI with letter A, FAS, and verb fluency. Gray matter volume in several bihemispheric ROIs (left dorsal frontal, right lower temporal, right occipital, and bilateral mesial temporal) mediated the relationship between cognitive impairment and fluency for fruits and vegetables. Gray matter volume in the right lower temporal ROI mediated the relationship between cognitive impairment and five fluency raw scores (animals, fruits and vegetables, tools, verbs, and the composite nouns score). Semantic memory exerts the strongest influence on word adjacency in letter fluency as well as semantic verbal fluency tasks. Orthography is a stronger influence than pronunciation. All types of fluency task raw scores (letter, noun, and verb) correlate with cerebral regions known to support verbal or nonverbal semantic memory. The findings emphasize the contribution of right hemisphere regions to fluency task performance, particularly for verb and letter fluency. The relationship between diagnosis and semantic fluency performance is mediated by semantic similarity of words and by gray matter volume in the right lower temporal region. 
24962069	Nerve growth factor metabolic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome.
Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 20140621 2014Jul
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition and the most common type of amnestic dementia in the elderly. Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at increased risk of developing AD in adulthood as a result of chromosome 21 trisomy and triplication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. In both conditions, the central nervous system (CNS) basal forebrain cholinergic system progressively degenerates, and such changes contribute to the manifestation of cognitive decline and dementia. Given the strong dependency of these neurons on nerve growth factor (NGF), it was hypothesized that their atrophy was caused by NGF deficits. However, in AD, the synthesis of NGF is not affected at the transcript level and there is a marked increase in its precursor, proNGF. This apparent paradox remained elusive for many years. In this review, we discuss the recent evidence supporting a CNS deficit in the extracellular metabolism of NGF, both in AD and in DS brains. We describe the nature of this trophic disconnection and its implication for the atrophy of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. We further discuss the potential of NGF pathway markers as diagnostic indicators of a CNS trophic disconnection.  
24448684	Understanding the relative importance of preserving functional abilities in Alzheimer's disease in the United States and Germany.
Qual Life Res 20140122 2014Aug
To estimate the relative importance that Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregivers in the United States and Germany place on preserving patients' ability to perform activities of daily living. US and German residents providing care for a person with AD completed an online preference survey. Each respondent completed five best-worst scaling questions. Each question related to five of 10 activities from the Disability Assessment for Dementia scale. Preference weights, indicating the relative importance of preserving the ability to perform these 10 activities for 36 months, were estimated using maximum-difference scaling. A separate model was estimated for each country. Four hundred and three US and 400 German caregivers completed the survey. In both countries, preserving a patients' ability to use the toilet without accidents was the most important activity and handling money was the least important activity. There were few differences between US and German caregivers in the relative importance across activities. Caregivers generally placed greater importance on preserving basic activities of daily living than on preserving instrumental activities of daily living. Understanding differences in the relative importance of functional items in the DAD may contribute to a better understanding of the benefits of different AD treatment and support measures. 
24697253	Theory of mind and cognitive processes in aging and Alzheimer type dementia: a systematic review.
Aging Ment Health 20140404 2014Sep
Theory of mind (ToM) performance in aging and dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) has been a growing interest of researchers and recently, theoretical trends in ToM development have led to a focus on determining the cognitive skills involved in ToM performance. The aim of the present review is to answer three main questions: How is ToM assessed in aging and DAT? How does ToM performance evolve in aging and DAT? Do cognitive processes influence ToM performance in aging and DAT? A systematic review was conducted to provide a targeted overview of recent studies relating ToM performance with cognitive processes in aging and DAT. RESULTS suggest a decrease in ToM performance, more pronounced in complex ToM tasks. Moreover, the review points up the strong involvement of executive functions, especially inhibition, and reasoning skills in ToM task achievement. Current data suggest that the structure of ToM tasks itself could lead to poor performance, especially in populations with reduced cognitive abilities. 
24831823	Neuronal driven pre-plaque inflammation in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140328 2014Oct
Chronic brain inflammation is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is classically attributed to amyloid plaque deposition. However, whether the amyloid pathology can trigger early inflammatory processes before plaque deposition remains a matter of debate. To address the possibility that a pre-plaque inflammatory process occurs, we investigated the status of neuronal, astrocytic, and microglial markers in pre- and post-amyloid plaque stages in a novel transgenic rat model of an AD-like amyloid pathology (McGill-R-Thy1-APP). In this model, we found a marked upregulation of several classical inflammatory markers such as COX-2, IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, and fractalkine (CX3CL1) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, many of these markers were highly expressed in amyloid beta-burdened neurons. Activated astrocytes and microglia were associated with these AÎ²-burdened neurons. These findings confirm the occurrence of a proinflammatory process preceding amyloid plaque deposition and suggest that AÎ²-burdened neurons play a crucial role in initiating inflammation in AD.  
24838186	A novel mutation in the PSEN2 gene (N141Y) associated with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese Han family.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140418 2014Oct
The mutations in the presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene as causes of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) have never been reported in Asia. We conducted a phenotype and pedigree study by performing neuropathological examination and target region sequencing in a family of 3 generations. Six members in this family developed dementia in their fifth decade and died in their sixth decade. The proband was diagnosed clinically with AD, which was confirmed by an autopsy. Target region sequencing showed a novel missense mutation at codon 141 (N141Y) of the PSEN2 gene that predicts an Asparagine-to-Tyrosine substitution in the affected individuals. The result was validated by Sanger sequencing in 7 family members (2 affected and 5 unaffected). The mutation was absent in the 5 clinically unaffected relatives and 188 control subjects. No influence of the APOE genotype was observed. We are the first to demonstrate a novel PSEN2 N141Y mutation in a Chinese Han family with early-onset AD. 
24856056	Blood pressure variability predicts cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140501 2014Oct
The aim of our study was to evaluate whether blood pressure variability influences the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two hundred and forty AD patients were periodically evaluated for a 12-month period. The blood pressure (BP) status of each patient was defined through mean and coefficient of variation for both systolic and diastolic BP. Progression of cognitive decline was investigated using the Mini Mental State Examination administered at entry and at the end of follow-up. Among the considered BP indices, only systolic BP variability explained the decrease in the Mini Mental State Examination score after adjustment for confounding variables (multiple linear regression: R(2) = 0.603, adjusted R(2) = 0.513; p &lt; 0.001; logistic regression model: odds ratio = 2.882, 95% confidence interval = 1.772-4.495; p &lt; 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic analysis for evaluating the ability of systolic BP variability to predict a faster cognitive decline presented an area under the curve of 0.913 (95% confidence interval = 0.874-0.953; p &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that BP variability may be added to the list of the potential vascular risk factors and included in the evaluation of AD patients to better define their risk profile. 
24863667	Influence of Alzheimer's disease genes on cognitive decline: the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140430 2014Oct
Cognitive decline is a reduction in cognitive ability usually associated with aging, and those with more extreme cognitive decline either have or are at risk of progressing to mild cognitive impairment and dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that genetic variants predisposing to AD should be predictive of cognitive decline in elderly individuals. We selected 1325 subjects with extreme cognitive decline and 1083 well-matched control subjects from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study in which more than 30,000 southern Chinese older people have been recruited and followed up. Thirty single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 29 AD-associated genes were genotyped. No statistically significant allelic associations with cognitive decline were found by individual variant analysis. At the level of genotypic association, we confirmed that the APOE Îµ4 homozygote significantly accelerated cognitive decline and found that carriers of the ACE rs1800764_C allele were more likely to show cognitive decline than noncarriers, particularly in those without college education. However, these effects do not survive after multiple testing corrections, and together they only explain 1.7% of the phenotypic variance in cognitive score change. This study suggests that AD risk variants and/or genes are not powerful predictors of cognitive decline in our Chinese sample.  
24863668	Iron overload accelerates neuronal amyloid-Î² production and cognitive impairment in transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease.

Iron dyshomeostasis is proving increasingly likely to be involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD); yet, its mechanism is not well understood. Here, we investigated the AD-related mechanism(s) of iron-sulfate exposure in vitro and in vivo, using cultured primary cortical neurons and APP/PS1 AD-model mice, respectively. In both systems, we observed iron-induced disruptions of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, neuronal signaling, and cognitive behavior. Iron overload increased production of amyloidogenic KPI-APP and amyloid beta. Further, this APP misprocessing was blocked by MK-801 in vitro, suggesting the effect was N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent. Calcium imaging confirmed that 24 hours iron exposure led to disrupted synaptic signaling by augmenting GluN2B-containing NMDAR expression-GluN2B messenger RNA and protein levels were increased and promoting excessing extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling. The disrupted GluN2B expression was concurrent with diminished expression of the splicing factors, sc35 and hnRNPA1. In APP/PS1 mice, chronic iron treatment led to hastened progression of cognitive impairment with the novel object recognition discrimination index, revealing a deficit at the age of 4 months, concomitant with augmented GluN2B expression. Together, these data suggest iron-induced APP misprocessing and hastened cognitive decline occur through inordinate extrasynaptic NMDAR activation. 
24866402	Investigation of TREM2, PLD3, and UNC5C variants in patients with Alzheimer's disease from mainland China.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140501 2014Oct
Recently, 3 rare coding variants significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk have been identified in western populations using whole exome sequencing method, including p.R47H in TREM2, p.V232M in PLD3, and p.T835M in UNC5C. To examine whether these variants are genetic risk factors in patients with AD from mainland China, we sequenced exon 2 of TREM2, exon 9 of PLD3, and exon 15 of UNC5C in Chinese Han population including 360 patients with AD and 400 control individuals. As a result, none of these 3 variants were identified in all subjects, however, 1 novel variant (p.A130V) in TREM2 and 4 novel variants (p.Q860H, p.T837K, p.S843G, and p.V836V) in UNC5C were detected in unrelated patients with late-onset AD. These findings suggest the 3 rare coding variants might not play an important role in AD risk in mainland China.  
24866404	White matter integrity is associated with cerebrospinal fluid markers of Alzheimer's disease in normal adults.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140502 2014Oct
We explored whether white matter (WM) integrity in cognitively normal (CN) older adults is associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Twenty CN older adults underwent lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging within a few days of each other. Analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data involved a priori region of interest and voxelwise approaches. The region of interest results revealed a positive correlation between CSF measures of amyloid-beta (AÎ²(42) and AÎ²(42)/p-Tau(181)) and WM integrity in the fornix, a relationship which persisted after controlling for hippocampal volume and fornix volume. Lower WM integrity in the same portion of the fornix was also associated with reduced performance on the Digit Symbol test. Subsequent exploratory voxelwise analyses indicated a positive correlation between CSF AÎ²(42)/p-Tau(181) and WM integrity in bilateral portions of the fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and in the corpus callosum and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Our results link lower WM microstructural integrity in CN older adults with CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and suggest that this association in the fornix may be independent of volumetric measures. 
24880964	Exome sequencing identifies 2 novel presenilin 1 mutations (p.L166V and p.S230R) in British early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140502 2014Oct
Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) represents 1%-2% of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, and it is generally characterized by a positive family history and a rapidly progressive symptomatology. Rare coding and fully penetrant variants in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) are the only causative mutations reported for autosomal dominant AD. Thus, in this study we used exome sequencing data to rapidly screen rare coding variability in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, in a British cohort composed of 47 unrelated EOAD cases and 179 elderly controls, neuropathologically proven. We report 2 novel and likely pathogenic variants in PSEN1 (p.L166V and p.S230R). A comprehensive catalog of rare pathogenic variants in the AD Mendelian genes is pivotal for a premortem diagnosis of autosomal dominant EOAD and for the differential diagnosis with other early onset dementias such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).  
24908168	ABCA7 gene and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese in Taiwan.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140514 2014Oct
The ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 7 gene (ABCA7) was recently identified as a susceptible gene of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Caucasian population and African Americans. To test its genetic effect in the Han-Chinese population, 536 AD cases and 307 cognitive-intact, elder controls were genotyped for ABCA7 rs3764650 and apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ2/Îµ3/Îµ4 alleles. Global cognitive performance was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination in both AD patients and controls. For AD patients, comprehensive evaluation of each cognitive domain was further conducted as the following: (1) attention (forward and backward digit span); (2) memory (12-item word recall test); (3) executive function (category verbal fluency); (4) processing speed (Trail making test, part A); and (5) naming task (Boston naming test). ABCA7 rs3764650 was significantly associated with AD and the GG genotype carried a reduced risk for AD (odds ratio = 0.52, p = 0.0026). The association was further confirmed in 1802 population-based, healthy controls from Taiwan Biobank as a replicate (odds ratio = 0.70, p = 0.032). After adjustment of age, sex, and APOE Îµ4 allele, rs3764650 remained to be an independent predictor of AD (p = 0.001). The influence of ABCA7 was only evident in individuals without APOE Îµ4 alleles (p = 0.0004) but absent in Îµ4 carriers (p = 0.91). None of the cognitive tests was related to ABCA7 rs3764650 genotypes. The minor allele frequency and effect size of rs3764650 disclosed in the Han-Chinese population differed from those reported in the Caucasians and African Americans. Further studies were warranted to elucidate ABCA7's effect among different ethnic groups. 
24756728	Influence of Alpha-2-Macroglobulin 5Â bp I/D and Ile1000Val Polymorphisms on the Susceptibility of Alzheimer's disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 52 Studies.
Cell Biochem. Biophys.  2014Sep
Accumulating studies have evaluated the association of Alpha-2-Macroglobulin gene (A2M) 5Â bp insertion/deletion (5Â bp I/D, rs3832852) and Ile1000Val (rs669) polymorphisms with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the results remain inconclusive. To investigate whether these two polymorphisms facilitate the susceptibility to AD, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, CNKI, and Google Scholar were searched to get the genetic association studies. All statistical analyses were conducted with Review Manager 5.2 and STATA11.0. Fifty-two articles were included in the final meta-analysis. We performed meta-analysis of 39 studies involving 8,267 cases and 7,932 controls for the 5Â bp I/D polymorphism and 27 studies involving 6,585 cases and 6,637 controls for the Ile/Val polymorphism. Overall results did not show significant association between these two polymorphisms and AD risk in dominant, recessive, and multiplicative genetic models. On the stratification analysesÂ by ethnicity and APOE Îµ4 status with genotypes of polymorphism sites, similar negative associations were found. The meta-analysis suggests that there is no enough evidence for associations of A2M gene polymorphisms (5Â bp I/D, Ile1000Val) with AD risk at present, even after stratification byÂ ethnicity and APOE Îµ4 with genotypes of polymorphism sites.Â However, due to the heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, the results should be interpreted with caution.  
25118905	Dendritic and spinal alterations of neurons from Edinger-Westphal nucleus in Alzheimer's disease.
Folia Neuropathol  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, causing a progressive decline of intellectual faculties, impairment of behavior and social performance, and impairment of speech eloquence, associated with various neurological manifestations based on a variable neuropathological background. Edinger-Westphal nucleus is a selective target of Alzheimer pathology early in the course of the disease. We attempted to determine the morphological alterations of the dendrites and the dendritic spines in Edinger-Westphal nucleus of 7 cases that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease. For the histological study, we applied (a) routine neuropathological techniques and (b) rapid Golgi method. We proceeded to 3D neuronal reconstruction for the estimation of dendritic and spinal changes in Alzheimer's disease. The morphological and morphometric analysis revealed a substantial neuronal loss and synaptic alterations in Edinger-Westphal nucleus in all the cases of Alzheimer's disease. Distal dendritic branches are prominently affected. The neuronal loss and alteration of the spines in Edinger-Westphal nucleus in Alzheimer's disease may be related to the exaggerated pupillary reaction to cholinergic antagonists. Furthermore, the vulnerability of distal branches to Alzheimer's disease might be related to neuroplasticity impairment.  
24350994	Intracranial injection of PEG-PEI/ROCK II-siRNA improves cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Neurosci. 20140122 2014Sep
A plenty of studies have demonstrated that the Rho/ROCK pathway is involved in the neuronal loss and inhibition of axonal regeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate whether intracranial injection of PEG-PEI/ROCK II siRNA (PPRS) would improve the cognitive impairments in a senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) model of AD. Five male senescence-resistant inbred strain (SAMR1) mice and 15 male senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) strain mice were divided into the following three groups:PPRS group, PEG-PEI/ ROCK II-Scramble (PPRScr) siRNA group, and normal group (SAMR1). Total volumes of 2.3Â Î¼l of nanoparticles or saline were intracranially injected under the guidance of a stereotaxic apparatus. The injections were performed every three days and lasted for two weeks. Four weeks after injection, the Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate the spatial learning and memory functions of the mice. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was detected by immunohistochemistry. Mice in the PPRS-treated group exhibited decreases in escape latencies over the three successive days of navigating the test and crossing the target quadrant during the spatial probe test more frequently than did the mice in the PPRScr-treated group. Analyses of ChAT activity revealed that greater numbers of ChAT-positive cells were present in the hippocampal regions of the PPRS-treated mice than in the PPRScr group. Intracranial injection of PPRS improved the cognitive impairments of SAM mice, and this improvement may have been mediated by enhancement of ChAT activity in the hippocampus. 
24346138	The potential role of kynurenines in Alzheimer's disease: pathomechanism and therapeutic possibilities by influencing the glutamate receptors.
J Neural Transm 20131218 2014Aug
The pathomechanism of neurodegenerative disorders still poses a challenge to neuroscientists, and continuous research is under way with the aim of attaining an understanding of the exact background of these devastating diseases. The pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with characteristic neuropathological features such as extracellular amyloid-Î² and intracellular tau deposition. Glutamate excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation are also factors that are known to contribute to the neurodegenerative process, but a cerebrovascular dysfunction has recently also been implicated in AD. Current therapeutic tools offer moderate symptomatic treatment, but fail to reduce disease progression. The kynurenine pathway (KP) has been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative processes, and alterations in the KP have been demonstrated in both acute and chronic neurological disorders. Kynurenines have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and in immunological processes. Targeting the KP, therefore, offers a valuable strategic option for the attenuation of glutamatergic excitotoxicity, and for neuroprotection.  
24041480	Detecting brain structural changes as biomarker from magnetic resonance images using a local feature based SVM approach.
J. Neurosci. Methods 20130914 2014Jan15
Detecting brain structural changes from magnetic resonance (MR) images can facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Many existing methods require an accurate deformation registration, which is difficult to achieve and therefore prevents them from obtaining high accuracy. We develop a novel local feature based support vector machine (SVM) approach to detect brain structural changes as potential biomarkers. This approach does not require deformation registration and thus is less influenced by artifacts such as image distortion. We represent the anatomical structures based on scale invariant feature transform (SIFT). Likelihood scores calculated using feature-based morphometry is used as the criterion to categorize image features into three classes (healthy, patient and noise). Regional SVMs are trained to classify the three types of image features in different brain regions. Only healthy and patient features are used to predict the disease status of new brain images. An ensemble classifier is built from the regional SVMs to obtain better prediction accuracy. We apply this approach to 3D MR images of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and bipolar disorder. The classification accuracy ranges between 70% and 87%. The highly predictive disease-related regions, which represent significant anatomical differences between the healthy and diseased, are shown in heat maps. The common and disease-specific brain regions are identified by comparing the highly predictive regions in each disease. All of the top-ranked regions are supported by literature. Thus, this approach will be a promising tool for assisting automatic diagnosis and advancing mechanism studies of neurological and psychiatric diseases.  
24091139	Comparison of manual and semi-automated segmentation methods to evaluate hippocampus volume in APP and PS1 transgenic mice obtained via in vivo magnetic resonance imaging.
J. Neurosci. Methods 20131001 2014Jan15
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease is valuable to understand better the structural changes that occur in the brain and could provide a means to test drug treatments. A hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease is atrophy of the hippocampus, which is an early biomarker of the disease. MRI can be used to detect and monitor this biomarker. Repeated measurements using in vivo 3D T2-weighted imaging of mice were used to assess the methods. Each mouse was imaged twice in one week and twice the following week and no changes in volume were expected. The hippocampus was segmented both manually and semi-automatically. Registration was done to gain information on shape changes. The volumes from each mouse were compared intra-mouse, between mice and to hippocampus volume values in the literature. A reliable method was developed which was able to detect difference in volumes of hippocampus between mice when performed by a single individual. The semi-automated segmentation was unable to detect the same level of differences. The semi-automated segmentation method gave larger hippocampus volumes, with 78-87% reliability between the manual and semi-automated segmentation. Although more accurate, the manual segmentation is laborious and suffers from inter- and intra-variability. These results suggest that manual segmentation is still considered the most reliable segmentation method for small structures. However, if performing longitudinal studies, where there is at least one year between imaging sessions, the segmentation should be done all at once at the end of all the imaging sessions. If segmentation is done after each imaging session, with at least a year passing between segmentations, very small variations in volumes can be missed. This method provides a means to quantify the volume of the hippocampus in a live mouse using manual segmentation, which is the first step toward studying hippocampus atrophy in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 
24121089	Application of fused lasso logistic regression to the study of corpus callosum thickness in early Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurosci. Methods 20131009 2014Jan15
We propose a fused lasso logistic regression to analyze callosal thickness profiles. The fused lasso regression imposes penalties on both the l1-norm of the model coefficients and their successive differences, and finds only a small number of non-zero coefficients which are locally constant. An iterative method of solving logistic regression with fused lasso regularization is proposed to make this a practical procedure. In this study we analyzed callosal thickness profiles sampled at 100 equal intervals between the rostrum and the splenium. The method was applied to corpora callosa of elderly normal controls (NCs) and patients with very mild or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. We found specific locations in the genu and splenium of AD patients that are proportionally thinner than those of NCs. Callosal thickness in these regions combined with the Mini Mental State Examination scores differentiated AD from NC with 84% accuracy.  
24352679	Constructing and characterizing a bioactive small molecule and microRNA association network for Alzheimer's disease.
J R Soc Interface 20131218 2014Mar6
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Much effort has been devoted to developing effective therapeutic agents. Recently, targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) with small molecules has become a novel therapy for human diseases. In this study, we present a systematic computational approach to construct a bioactive Small molecule and miRNA association Network in AD (SmiRN-AD), which is based on the gene expression signatures of bioactive small molecule perturbation and AD-related miRNA regulation. We also performed topological and functional analysis of the SmiRN-AD from multiple perspectives. At the significance level of p â‰¤ 0.01, 496 small molecule-miRNA associations, including 25 AD-related miRNAs and 275 small molecules, were recognized and used to construct the SmiRN-AD. The drugs that were connected with the same miRNA tended to share common drug targets (p = 1.72 Ã— 10(-4)) and belong to the same therapeutic category (p = 4.22 Ã— 10(-8)). The miRNAs that were linked to the same small molecule regulated more common miRNA targets (p = 6.07 Ã— 10(-3)). Further analysis of the positive connections (quinostatin and miR-148b, amantadine and miR-15a) and the negative connections (melatonin and miR-30e-5p) indicated that our large-scale predictions afforded specific biological insights into AD pathogenesis and therapy. This study proposes a holistic strategy for deciphering the associations between small molecules and miRNAs in AD, which may be helpful for developing a novel effective miRNA-associated therapeutic strategy for AD. A comprehensive database for the SmiRN-AD and the differential expression patterns of the miRNA targets in AD is freely available at http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/SmiRN-AD/.  
24326519	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease, heating up and foxed by several proteins: pathomolecular effects of the aging process.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in older adults, affecting over 50% of those over age 85. Aging is the most important risk factor for the development of LOAD. Aging is associated with the decrease in the ability of cells to cope with cellular stress, especially protein aggregation. Here we describe how the process of aging affects pathways that control the processing and degradation of abnormal proteins including amyloid-Î² (AÎ²). Genetic association studies in LOAD have successfully identified a large number of genetic variants involved in the development of the disease. However, there is a gap in understanding the interconnections between these pathomolecular events that prevent us from discovering therapeutic targets. We propose novel, pertinent links to elucidate how the biology of aging affects the sequence of events in the development of LOAD. Furthermore we analyze and synthesize the molecular-pathologic-clinical correlations of the aging process, involving the HSF1 and FOXO family pathways, AÎ² metabolic pathway, and the different clinical stages of LOAD. Our new model postulates that the aging process would precede AÎ² accumulation, and attenuation of HSF1 is an "upstream" event in the cascade that results in excess AÎ² and synaptic dysfunction, which may lead to cognitive impairment and/or trigger "downstream" neurodegeneration and synaptic loss. Specific host factors, such as the activity of FOXO family pathways, would mediate the response to AÎ² toxicity and the pace of progression toward the clinical manifestations of AD.  
24710828	Identifying the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease by correlation- and nonlinearity-aware sparse Bayesian learning.
IEEE Trans Med Imaging 20140401 2014Jul
Predicting cognitive performance of subjects from their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures and identifying relevant imaging biomarkers are important research topics in the study of Alzheimer's disease. Traditionally, this task is performed by formulating a linear regression problem. Recently, it is found that using a linear sparse regression model can achieve better prediction accuracy. However, most existing studies only focus on the exploitation of sparsity of regression coefficients, ignoring useful structure information in regression coefficients. Also, these linear sparse models may not capture more complicated and possibly nonlinear relationships between cognitive performance and MRI measures. Motivated by these observations, in this work we build a sparse multivariate regression model for this task and propose an empirical sparse Bayesian learning algorithm. Different from existing sparse algorithms, the proposed algorithm models the response as a nonlinear function of the predictors by extending the predictor matrix with block structures. Further, it exploits not only inter-vector correlation among regression coefficient vectors, but also intra-block correlation in each regression coefficient vector. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database showed that the proposed algorithm not only achieved better prediction performance than state-of-the-art competitive methods, but also effectively identified biologically meaningful patterns.  
24033473	Increased amoeboid microglial density in the olfactory bulb of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients.
Brain Pathol. 20131028 2014Mar
The olfactory bulb (OB) is affected early in both Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), evidenced by the presence of disease-specific protein aggregates and an early loss of olfaction. Whereas previous studies showed amoeboid microglia in the classically affected brain regions of PD and AD patients, little was known about such changes in the OB. Using a morphometric approach, a significant increase in amoeboid microglia density within the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) of AD and PD patients was observed. These amoeboid microglia cells were in close apposition to Î²-amyloid, hyperphosphorylated tau or Î±-synuclein deposits, but no uptake of pathological proteins by microglia could be visualized. Subsequent analysis showed (i) no correlation between microglia and Î±-synuclein (PD), (ii) a positive correlation with Î²-amyloid (AD), and (iii) a negative correlation with hyperphosphorylated tau (AD). Furthermore, despite the observed pathological alterations in neurite morphology, neuronal loss was not apparent in the AON of both patient groups. Thus, we hypothesize that, in contrast to the classically affected brain regions of AD and PD patients, within the AON rather than neuronal loss, the increased density in amoeboid microglial cells, possibly in combination with neurite pathology, may contribute to functional deficits.  
24588823	Crosstalk between Behavior and Immune System During the Prodromal Stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
Curr. Pharm. Des.  2014
The crosstalk in the functional interplay of the neuroimmune system is essential to ensure homeostasis preservation and health. Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be understood in the context of aging of this neuroimmune communication. AD has an important genderdependent component and is benefitted by lifestyle strategies such as physical exercise, enriched environments and nutrition. Recently, the functional and redox state of peripheral immune cells has been proposed as a useful tool for measuring the progression of AD. The present review summarizes the relevance of the disruption of crosstalk among neurons, glial cells, immune mediators and cells from the very beginning of the prodromal stages of AD, when early BPSD symptoms have already started but cognitive function still seems apparently normal. The study of the role of neuroimmune system and how its disruption contributes to the onset of disease may help in understanding its biological mechanisms and in finding behavioral parameters and immunological biomarkers for the prodromic phases. Here we present results of 3xTg-AD mice from pre-morbid to early-stages of AD and how early BPSD-like symptoms correlate with changes in the organometrics of thymus and spleen that are indirect indicators of the immunological status. These functional relationships between behavioral and peripheral system also revealed the existence of differences between biological and chronological ages (an advanced biological age) since the prodromal stages. Overall, the data available suggest that the crosstalk between behavior (nervous) and immune system plays an important role since prodromal stages of AD.  
25076262	Self-assembly of stable oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates of AÎ² peptides relevant to Alzheimer's disease: morphology dependent Cu/heme toxicity and inhibition of PROS generation.
Dalton Trans  2014Aug12
Large and small aggregates of AÎ² peptides, resembling the morphology and dimensions of fibrillar and oligomeric forms of AÎ² respectively, relevant to Alzheimer's disease, are stabilized on electrodes using self-assembly. Both of these forms were found to bind redox active Cu and heme, resulting in active sites having distinctive biophysical properties. The reduced metal bound AÎ² active sites of both the oligomeric and fibrillar forms of AÎ² produce detrimental partially reduced oxygen species (PROS). While the larger aggregates of heme-AÎ² produce more PROS in situ, the smaller aggregates of Cu-AÎ² produce more PROS. 8-Hydroxy quinoline and methylene blue are inhibitors of Cu and heme bound AÎ² respectively, and are shown to efficiently reduce PROS formation in the oligomeric forms. However, these inhibitors are ineffective in reducing the toxicities of the Cu and heme bound AÎ² peptides in the fibrils, making them significantly more lethal than the smaller AÎ² aggregates.  
24787921	Is Amyloid-Î² an Innocent Bystander and Marker in Alzheimer's Disease? Is the Liability of Multivalent Cation Homeostasis and its Influence on Amyloid-Î² Function the Real Mechanism?
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Two decades of the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the prominence of AÎ²-targeting strategies have yet to meet the levels of original expectation. Disappointing results in numerous Phase II/III studies have called for a re-examination of the validity of the AÎ²-targeting approaches as an intervention strategy in AD. The mid-life onset of chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, insulin intolerance, and depression nominated as risk factors for the later development of AD) points to the possibility that each condition could involve mechanisms, which while relatively modest over a short-term, could have significant accumulative effects. What may also not be fully appreciated is that a number of these conditions involve potential disturbances to multivalent cations (MC) levels through various mechanisms such as autophagy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Furthermore, some MCs have intimate associations with the mechanisms by which AÎ² pathology manifests. Considering various lines of evidence and incorporating statistical analysis on Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) data of both causes of and prevalence of multifactorial risk factors in different world regions, we propose an MC hypothesis for AD. More specifically, we suggest that MC imbalance marks many chronic conditions and because of their involvement with AÎ² pathology, could reflect that AÎ² may be a vital manifestation and marker of underlying MC imbalance. Thus, careful targeting of MC imbalance may provide an alternative or complementary interventional approach to current AÎ² treatment strategies.  
24820014	Expression of the Glucose Transporter GLUT12 in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Alzheimer's disease (AD) might be conceptualized as a metabolic disease with progressive impairment of the brain's capacity to utilize glucose. One of the last glucose transporters discovered is GLUT12. The aim of the present work was to investigate the expression of GLUT12 in frontal cortex from AD patients. Human samples from young control donors barely expressed GLUT12. The level of expression of GLUT12 was significantly higher in AD compare to aged controls. Expression of GLUT12 and Ox-42, a microglia marker, correlate in controls but not in AD. The implications of these findings in AD are discussed further.  
24820015	Relationship Between Î²-Secretase, Inflammation and Core Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can track specific pathophysiological pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). The connection between these biomarkers remains unclear. To study six CSF biomarkers in a clinical cohort of patients with different neurodegenerative conditions. We measured markers of amyloid-Î² protein precursor (AÎ²PP) processing (AÎ²42, sAÎ²PPÎ², Î²-secretase activity), neuronal damage (total tau, p-tau), and inflammation (YKL-40) in CSF from 194 participants with the following diagnoses: subjective cognitive impairment or non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (na-SCI, n = 44), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 45), dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT, n = 59), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 22), and 24 cognitively normal controls. We compared biomarkers between clinical groups and CSF-profile groups, and we analyzed the correlation between biomarkers. CSF levels of sAÎ²PPÎ² were decreased in FTD patients compared to the other groups. YKL-40 was elevated in DAT and FTD, and also in aMCI patients. CSF AÎ²42 correlated positively with Î²-secretase activity (RS = 0.262) and sAÎ²PPÎ² (RS = 0.341). CSF YKL-40 correlated positively with total tau (RS = 0.467) and p-tau (RS = 0.429). CSF p-tau and sAÎ²PPÎ² contributed significantly to distinguish DAT from FTD. CSF biomarkers of AÎ²PP processing correlate with each other and are decreased in FTD. The inflammatory marker YKL-40 is increased in different neurodegenerative diseases, even in early stages, and it correlates with biomarkers of neurodegeneration. This suggests that inflammation is a common feature in AD and FTD. A combination of CSF biomarkers tracking distinct pathophysiological processes may be useful to classify subjects with neurodegenerative conditions. 
24825565	Heart Diseases and Long-Term Risk of Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: A Population-Based CAIDE Study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Many cardiovascular risk factors are shown to increase the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the impact of heart disease on later development of dementia is still unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the long-term risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) related to midlife and late-life atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) in a population-based study with a follow-up of over 25 years. Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) study includes 2000 participants who were randomly selected from four separate, population-based samples originally studied in midlife (1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987). Re-examinations were carried out in 1998 and 2005-2008. Altogether 1,510 (75.5%) persons participated in at least one re-examination, and 127 (8.4%) persons were diagnosed with dementia (of which 102 had AD). AF in late-life was an independent risk factor for dementia (HR 2.61, 95% CI 1.05-6.47; p = 0.039) and AD (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.04-6.16; p = 0.040) in the fully adjusted analyses. The association was even stronger among the apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 non-carriers. Late-life HF, but not CAD, tended to increase the risks as well. Heart diseases diagnosed at midlife did not increase the risk of later dementia and AD. Late-life heart diseases increase the subsequent risk of dementia and AD. Prevention and effective treatment of heart diseases may be important also from the perspective of brain health and cognitive functioning. 
24825567	Modulation of neuronal nicotinic receptor by quinolizidine alkaloids causes neuroprotection on a cellular Alzheimer model.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and neurodegenerative disorder and one of the current therapies involves strengthening the cholinergic tone in central synapses. Neuroprotective properties for nicotine have been described in AD, through its actions on nicotinic receptors and the further activation of the PI3K/Akt/Bcl-2 survival pathway. We have tested a quinolizidine alkaloid extract (TM0112) obtained from Teline monspessulanna (L.) K. Koch seeds to evaluate its action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in a neuronal AD model. Our data show that PC-12 cells pretreated with amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide for 24 h in presence of TM0112 modified AÎ²-reduction on cellular viability (AÎ² = 80 Â± 3%; +TM0112 = 113 Â± 4%, n = 15). In addition, this effect was blocked with atropine, MLA, and Î±-BTX (+TM0112+atropine = 87 Â± 4%; +TM0112+MLA = 86 Â± 4%; +TM0112+Î±-BTX = 92 Â± 3%). Furthermore, similar protective effects were observed in rat cortical neurons (AÎ² = 63 Â± 6%; +TM0112 = 114 Â± 8%), but not in HEK293T cells (AÎ² = 61.4 Â± 6.1%; +TM0112 = 62.8 Â± 5.2) that do not express Î±7 nAChR. Moreover, the frequency of synaptic activity in the neuronal network (AÎ² = 51.6 Â± 16.9%; +TM0112 = 210.8 Â± 47.9%, n &gt; 10), as well as the intracellular Ca2+ transients were recovered by TM0112 (AÎ² = 61.4 Â± 6.9%; +TM0112 = 112.0 Â± 5.7%; n = 3) in rat hippocampal neurons. TM0112 increased P-Akt, up to 250% with respect to control, and elevated Bcl-2/Bax percentage (AÎ² = 61.0 Â± 8.2%; +TM0112 = 105.4 Â± 19.5%, n = 4), suggesting a coupling between nAChR activation and an intracellular neuroprotective pathway. Our results suggest that TM0112 could be a new potential source for anti-AD drugs.  
24840565	A Lack of Correlation between the Incidence of Lyme Disease and Deaths due to Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Reports that Lyme disease (LD) causes Alzheimer's disease (AD) have appeared in academic journals and online. If the biological agent Borrelia burgdorferi that causes LD also causes AD, then areas with the highest levels of LD should have significantly higher numbers of deaths due to AD compared to low LD areas. Here we show there is no statistically significant correlation between the incidence of LD and deaths due to AD in the US. Furthermore, the 13 states with the highest deaths due to AD were statistically different (p &lt; 0.0001) from those with high LD incidence.  
24840566	Characteristics of Alzheimer's Disease among Patients in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Beijing.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
In order to obtain data from patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia and their informants in a uniform manner and to foster further research among the Chinese and other races, we have conducted an international study to recruit patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Beijing. The Uniform Data Set was translated into Chinese and administrated to AD patients and their informants. A total of 1,107 AD dementia patients were recruited, including 691 from Taiwan, 244 from Beijing, and 172 from Hong Kong. There were differences in the AD patients: gender (p = 0.099), education (p &lt; 0.001), age (p &lt; 0.001), and handedness (p = 0.007). For informants, age (p = 0.679), gender (p = 0.117), education (p &lt; 0.001), and living together or not (p &lt; 0.001) differed in the three samples. Although three areas across the Taiwan Strait are ethnic Chinese, the clinical picture for patients and informants are very different. Further study is needed to clarify the significance of clinical characteristics in Chinese societies.  
24840570	Examining Executive Dysfunction with the Institute of Cognitive Neurology (INECO) Frontal Screening (IFS): Normative Values from a Healthy Sample and Clinical Utility in Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
The Institute of Cognitive Neurology (INECO) Frontal Screening (IFS) is a brief neuropsychological tool recently devised for the evaluation of executive dysfunction in neurodegenerative conditions. In this study we present a cross-cultural validation of the IFS for the Portuguese population, provide normative values from a healthy sample, determine how age and education affect performance, and inspect its clinical utility in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A comparison with the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) was undertaken, and correlations with other well-established executive functions measures were examined. The normative sample included 204 participants varying widely in age (20-85 years) and education (3-21 years). The clinical sample (n = 21) was compared with a sample of age- and education-matched controls (n = 21). Healthy participants completed the IFS and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In addition to these, the patients (and matched controls) completed the FAB and a battery of other executive tests. IFS scores were positively affected by education and MMSE, and negatively affected by age. Patients underperformed controls on the IFS, and correlations were found with the Clock Drawing Test, Stroop test, and the Zoo Map and Rule Shift Card tests of the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome. A cut-off of 17 optimally differentiated patients from controls. While 88% of the IFS sub-tests discriminated patients from controls, only 67% of the FAB sub-tests did so. Age and education should be taken into account when interpreting performance on the IFS. The IFS is useful to detect executive dysfunction in AD, showing good discriminant and concurrent validities. 
24840571	Ecological assessment of emotional enhancement of memory in progressive nonfluent aphasia and Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Events which are imbued with emotion are typically remembered vividly and with more confidence than similar non-emotional events. The extent that emotional enhancement of memory is compromised in neurodegenerative disorders is unclear, despite differential effects of dementia on emotion processing ability. To examine emotional enhancement of memory using an ecologically valid task in progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), an expressive language subtype of frontotemporal dementia, in comparison to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and matched-controls. Twenty-five dementia patients (13 PNFA, 12 AD) and 10 controls viewed either an emotionally arousing or a closely matched non-emotional story. Multiple-choice recognition memory was tested after a 1-hour delay. The alternate story was presented two weeks later. PNFA showed a similar level of memory for the emotional and neutral story, whereas both controls and AD remembered significantly more details from the emotional than the neutral story. Correlation analyses indicated that in PNFA, emotional story memory correlated with reduced emotion recognition, whereas in AD, neutral story memory correlated with visual recall memory performance only. Furthermore, in PNFA, reduced emotional memory enhancement was associated with increased carer stress and depression. Emotional memory enhancement is absent in PNFA, whereas emotion facilitates memory for real-life events in AD. Disrupted emotional memory enhancement in PNFA is associated with reduced emotion recognition ability, suggesting that widespread emotion processing dysfunction is present in this disease. Crucially, loss of emotional enhancement influences carer wellbeing, which represents an important avenue for future studies to examine. 
24840572	Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy in Alzheimer's disease and other dementia using autopsy as standard of truth.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial to implement the latest treatment strategies and management of AD symptoms. Diagnostic procedures play a major role in this detection process but evidence on their respective accuracy is still limited. To conduct a systematic literature on the sensitivity and specificity of different test modalities to identify AD patients and perform meta-analyses on the test accuracy values of studies focusing on autopsy-confirmation as the standard of truth. The systematic review identified all English papers published between 1984 and 2011 on diagnostic imaging tests and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers including results on the newest technologies currently investigated in this area. Meta-analyses using bivariate fixed and random-effect models and hierarchical summary receiver operating curve (HSROC) random-effect model were applied. Out of the 1,189 records, 20 publications were identified to report the accuracy of diagnostic tests in distinguishing autopsy-confirmed AD patients from other dementia types and healthy controls. Looking at all tests and comparator populations together, sensitivity was calculated at 85.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80.9%-90.0%) and specificity at 77.7% (95% CI: 70.2%-85.1%). The area under the HSROC curve was 0.88. Sensitivity and specificity values were higher for imaging procedures, and slightly lower for CSF biomarkers. Test-specific random-effect models could not be calculated due to the small number of studies. The review and meta-analysis point to a slight advantage of imaging procedures in correctly detecting AD patients but also highlight the limited evidence on autopsy-confirmations and heterogeneity in study designs. 
24844685	Amyloid Plaque-Independent Deficit of Early Postnatal Visual Cortical Plasticity in the 5XFAD Transgenic Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Autosomal dominant forms of familial Alzheimer's disease are linked to an aberrant processing of the amyloid-Î² protein precursor, which results in an increased production of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides that first form oligomers and eventually aggregate in the form of extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain. The accumulation of AÎ² peptides oligomers seems to correlate with alterations of synaptic transmission in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease. Whether AÎ² aggregation disrupts synaptic function independently of amyloid plaques deposition still needs further research. Here we report an amyloid plaque-independent deficit of neuronal plasticity after short-term sensory deprivation in the visual system of 5XFAD mice.  
24844686	Previously Unrecognized Missense Mutation E126K of PSEN2 Segregates with Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease in a Family.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Mutations in the gene PSEN2 are a rare cause of early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). PSEN2 sequence variants are often only found in one patient and pathogenicity cannot be formally documented. Here we describe a previously unrecognized sequence change (c.376G&gt;A) in PSEN2 in an EOAD patient and her likewise affected mother. This change results in the exchange of amino acid glutamic acid (E) by lysine (K) at position 126 of the protein (p.E126K). Pathogenicity of the mutation is shown by segregation with disease, evolutionary conservation of E126, and in silico analysis of the mutation.  
24844688	External cys/cySS Redox State Modification Controls the Intracellular Redox State and Neurodegeneration via Akt in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model Neurons.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
The extracellular redox environment of cells is mainly set by the redox couple cysteine/cystine (cys/cySS) while intracellular redox is buffered by reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), but controlled by NAD(P)H/NAD(P). With aging, the extracellular redox environment shifts in the oxidized direction beyond middle-age. Since aging is the primary risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), here our aim was to determine if a reduced extracellular cys/cySS redox potential of cultured primary mouse neurons changes the intracellular redox environment, affects pAkt levels, and protects against neuron loss. A reductive shift in cys/cySS in the extracellular medium of neuron cultures from young (4 month) and old (21 month) neurons from non-transgenic) and triple transgenic AD-like mice (3xTg-AD) caused an increase in intracellular NAD(P)H and GSH levels along with lower reactive oxygen species levels. Importantly, the imposed reductive shift decreased neuron death markedly in the 21 month neurons of both genotypes. Moreover, a reduced cys/cySS redox state increased the pAkt/Akt ratio in 21 month aging and AD-like neurons that positively correlated with a decreased neuron loss. Our findings demonstrate that manipulating the extracellular redox environment toward a more reduced redox potential is neuroprotective in both aging and AD-like neurons and may be a powerful and pragmatic therapeutic tool in aging and age-related diseases like AD.  
24844690	Reductions in Endocannabinoid Levels and Enhanced Coupling of Cannabinoid Receptors in the Striatum are Accompanied by Cognitive Impairments in the AÎ²PPswe/PS1Î”E9 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Alterations in the endocannabinoid system (ECS) are thought to play a role in learning and memory impairments observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to determine the status of the brain ECS in the AÎ²PPswe/PS1Î”E9 model of AD. The ECS comprises the neuromodulatory lipid endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2AG), which interact with the G protein-coupled type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid receptors. Using mass spectrometry, we quantified endocannabinoid levels and assessed lipidomic profiles of the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of 4-8 month old wildtype and AÎ²PPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice to determine whether regional variations in endocannabinoids and lipid metabolism are observed with age and disease progression. Additionally, open-field activity, performance in the contextual fear conditioning task, and various other tasks assessing spatial and recognition memory were examined to determine the influence of age and pathology on these parameters. At all ages, AÎ²PPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice were significantly hyperactive in the open-field and acquired contextual fear as well as wildtype mice, reflecting intact associative learning. They, however, exhibited enhanced contextual fear memory and reduced contextual fear extinction regardless of age. Disturbances in striatal lipid metabolism were observed in 6 and 8 month old AÎ²PPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice. Endocannabinoids increased significantly with age in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of both genotypes. 8 month old AÎ²PPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice displayed significantly lower levels of striatal 2AG than wildtype mice, but greater cannabinoid receptor/effector coupling. This study shows that alterations in lipid metabolism and endocannabinoid signaling develop with age in AÎ²PPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice, possibly contributing to the development of AD-like behavioral deficits.  
24851856	Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of a 20-22 kDa NH2 Fragment of Human Tau Provide a Novel Neuronal Injury Biomarker in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Truncation at N-terminal domain of tau protein is early associated with neurofibrillary pathology in several human tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In affected subjects, the monitoring of total (t-tau) and/or phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides a reliable, indirect evaluation of cellular changes occurring in vivo and the identification of additional CSF biomarkers would better assist with the clinical practice, allowing a broader profile of underlying ongoing neurodegeneration. Here we show that a 20-22 kDa NH2-truncated form of human tau (i.e., NH2htau), a neurotoxic fragment of the full length protein (htau40) that we previously found in synapses from subjects affected by different tauopathies: (i) is not a normal constituent of CSF, unlike t-tau and p-tau, being exceptionally detected in patients without cognitive impairment; (ii) discriminates, with a weak specificity of 65% but a high sensitivity of 85%, patients carrying a large spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive deterioration (i.e., AD, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease with dementia, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, etc.) from subjects affected by other neurological disorders without mnesic disability; and (iii) is a neuronal injury biomarker as its levels in CSF are not related to the severity and progression of cognitive decline. The dynamic evaluation of NH2htau in CSF might add some useful hints in the ordinary clinical practice as it provides a novel, general biomarker for human tauopathies and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia.  
24898637	Motor effects of radio electric asymmetric conveyer in Alzheimer's disease: results from a cross-over trial.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
We conducted a randomized, cross-over trial to investigate the feasibility, safety, and motor effects of brain stimulation with radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technique in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuropostural optimization (NPO) and sham protocol were administered to 60 patients from the nursing home and day care units of the Alzheimer Center Reina SofÃ­a Foundation. The mean age was 84.1 (SD 7.9) years and 86.7% of the subjects were female. Motor measures were collected at baseline (T1), immediately (T2), seven (T3), and 11 days (T4) after treatment and, following cross-over, immediately (T5), seven (T6), and 11 (T7) days after treatment. Close safety surveillance was conducted from seven days before T1 to the end of the study (T7), with total study duration of 35 days. Wilcoxon test was utilized in the efficacy analysis, considering T1 and T5 as independent baseline assessments and using a threshold of p &lt; 0.05 (corrected) for statistical significance. The NPO protocol was easily administered and well accepted by the participants. Axial movements improved at T3 and T4 after NPO and at T2 after sham NPO, but no significant effects were observed in axial movements in the second phase of the trial. The effects of NPO in gait performance were not consistent. There were six falls between T2 and T7, but only two of them occurred in patients who had received NPO. In light of safety and feasibility of REAC, a trial with the more intense neuropsycho-physical optimization protocol is warranted.  
25024340	OXPHOS, Pyrimidine Nucleotides, and Alzheimer's Disease: A Pharmacogenomics Approach.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
We present a new hypothesis on the contribution of a dysfunction of the oxidative phosphorylation system, through a decrease in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, to the pathogenesis of late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the light of this proposition, different treatments for AD patients, such as enhancing the electron flow downstream the coenzyme Q10 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain or increasing mitochondrial biogenesis or directly providing pyrimidines, would be possible. AD is a multifactorial disorder and not all patients would benefit from these treatments. Those healthy individuals harboring mtDNA haplotypes related to a coupled OXPHOS function would probably be the better candidates for these preventive therapies.  
25111112	A rehabilitation program for Alzheimer's disease.
J Nurs Res  2014Sep
We present the design and implementation of a rehabilitation program (RP) adapted for people diagnosed with various phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The RP is a cognitive stimulation program that integrates the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine for aerobic, resistance, and balance exercises. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the RP on the physical and functional capacities, cognitive functions, and quality of life (QOL) of patients with AD. We enrolled 64 participants with AD for an RP intervention lasting 12 months. The research used a quasiexperimental approach. Assessed variables included cognitive ability (Mini-Mental State Examination), fitness (Chair Stand Test), level of independence (Barthel Index), and QOL (the 12-item Short Form Health Survey). Statistical analyses used the Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and the chi-squared test. The statistical significance level was set at 5%. The results indicate the effectiveness of the RP in improving the physical fitness and the QOL of participants with mild- to moderate-phase AD. The RP has a positive effect on patients with mild- to moderate-phase AD. However, we identified no effect for the RP on cognitive ability. These findings provide empirical evidence to support the use of RP as an effective complementary therapy. Improving the physical capacity and the QOL may have important long-term benefits for the older adults and their caregivers. The results of this study should be helpful to decision makers and geriatric health centers in planning and implementing RPs for elderly people with AD. 
24886908	The preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite: measuring amyloid-related decline.
JAMA Neurol  2014Aug1
As Alzheimer disease (AD) research moves to intervene in presymptomatic phases of the disease, we must develop outcome measures sensitive to the earliest disease-related changes. To demonstrate the feasibility of a cognitive composite outcome for clinically normal elderly participants with evidence of AD pathology using the ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study). With the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 studies. For the 2 studies that collected data on AÎ² levels (ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD "AÎ²-positive" placebo group and compare them with an "AÎ²-negative" group. For the study that did not include data on AÎ² levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we grouped participants by the presence of APOE-Îµ4 and by clinical progression. In ADNI, AÎ²-positive participants showed more decline than did AÎ²-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean [SE] difference, -1.239 [0.522] [95% CI, -2.263 to -0.215]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02). In AIBL, the mean (SE) difference is significant at both 18 months (-1.009 [0.406] [95% CI, -1.805 to -0.213]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01) and 36 months (-1.404 [0.452] [95% CI, -2.290 to -0.519]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.002). In the ADCS-PI study, APOE-Îµ4 allele carriers performed significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC at 24 months (mean [SE] score, -0.742 [0.294] [95% CI, -1.318 to -0.165]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01) and 36 months (-1.531 [0.469] [95% CI, -2.450 to -0.612]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.001). In the ADCS-PI study, cognitively normal participants who progress from a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 are significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC than cognitively normal participants who are stable with a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 at months 12, 24, and 36 (mean [SE] ADCS-PACC score, -4.471 [0.702] [95% CI, -5.848 to -3.094]; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001). Using pilot estimates of variance and assuming 500 participants per group with 30% attrition and a 5% Î± level, we project 80% power to detect effects in the range of Î”â€‰=â€‰0.467 to 0.733 on the ADCS-PACC. Analyses of at-risk cognitively normal populations suggest that we can reliably measure the first signs of cognitive decline with the ADCS-PACC. These analyses also suggest the feasibility of secondary prevention trials. 
24398104	Ocular changes in TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 20140129 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive decline in learning, memory, and executive functions. In addition to cognitive and behavioral deficits, vision disturbances have been reported in early stage of AD, well before the diagnosis is clearly established. To further investigate ocular abnormalities, a novel AD transgenic rat model was analyzed. Transgenic (Tg) rats (TgF344-AD) heterozygous for human mutant APPswe/PS1Î”E9 and age-matched wild type (WT) rats, as well as 20 human postmortem retinal samples from both AD and healthy donors were used. Visual function in the rodent was analyzed using the optokinetic response and luminance threshold recording from the superior colliculus. Immunohistochemistry on retinal and brain sections was used to detect various markers including amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques. As expected, AÎ² plaques were detected in the hippocampus, cortex, and retina of Tg rats. Plaque-like structures were also found in two AD human whole-mount retinas. The choroidal thickness was significantly reduced in both Tg rat and in AD human eyes when compared with age-matched controls. Tg rat eyes also showed hypertrophic retinal pigment epithelial cells, inflammatory cells, and upregulation of complement factor C3. Although visual acuity was lower in Tg than in WT rats, there was no significant difference in the retinal ganglion cell number and retinal vasculature. In this study, we observed pathological changes in the choroid and in RPE cells in the TgF344-AD rat model; choroidal thinning was observed further in human AD retina. Along with Ab deposition, the inflammatory response was manifested by microglial recruitment and complement activation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the significance and mechanisms of these pathological changes [corrected]. 
24752464	Cataract may be a non-memory feature of Alzheimer's disease in older people.
Eur. J. Epidemiol. 20140422 2014Jun
The aim of this study was to explore whether there is a relationship between cataract and Alzheimer's disease in older people in Taiwan. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by using the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program from 1999 to 2004. There were 19,954 subjects aged 65-84 with newly diagnosed cataract as the cataract group and 19,954 randomly selected subjects without cataract as the non-cataract group. Both groups were matched with sex, age and index year of diagnosing cataract. The risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with cataract was assessed. The overall incidence of Alzheimer's disease was 1.21 per 1,000 person-years in the cataract group and 0.73 per 1,000 person-years in the non-cataract group (crude hazard ratio 1.62, 95 % CI 1.28, 2.04). After adjustment for potential confounders, the adjusted HR of Alzheimer's disease was 1.43 (95 % CI 1.13, 1.82) for the cataract group, compared to the non-cataract group. Male (HR 1.36, 95 % CI 1.09, 1.70), age (every 1 year, HR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.06, 1.10) and head injury (HR 1.79, 95 % CI 1.08, 2.96) were other factors significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Older people with cataract are at 1.43-fold increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. More research is necessary to determine whether cataract is one of non-memory features of Alzheimer's disease. 
23816564	Recent advances in the application of metabolomics to Alzheimer's Disease.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20130629 2014Aug
The pathophysiological changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) begin decades before the emergence of clinical symptoms. Understanding the early mechanisms associated with AD pathology is, therefore, especially important for identifying disease-modifying therapeutic targets. While the majority of AD clinical trials to date have focused on anti-amyloid-beta (AÎ²) treatments, other therapeutic approaches may be necessary. The ability to monitor changes in cellular networks that include both AÎ² and non-AÎ² pathways is essential to advance our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of AD and subsequent development of cognitive symptoms and dementia. Metabolomics is a powerful tool that detects perturbations in the metabolome, a pool of metabolites that reflects changes downstream of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic fluctuations, and represents an accurate biochemical profile of the organism in health and disease. The application of metabolomics could help to identify biomarkers for early AD diagnosis, to discover novel therapeutic targets, and to monitor therapeutic response and disease progression. Moreover, given the considerable parallel between mouse and human metabolism, the use of metabolomics provides ready translation of animal research into human studies for accelerated drug design. In this review, we will summarize current progress in the application of metabolomics in both animal models and in humans to further understanding of the mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis. 
24071439	The Alzheimer's disease mitochondrial cascade hypothesis: progress and perspectives.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20130923 2014Aug
Ten years ago we first proposed the Alzheimer's disease (AD) mitochondrial cascade hypothesis. This hypothesis maintains that gene inheritance defines an individual's baseline mitochondrial function; inherited and environmental factors determine rates at which mitochondrial function changes over time; and baseline mitochondrial function and mitochondrial change rates influence AD chronology. Our hypothesis unequivocally states in sporadic, late-onset AD, mitochondrial function affects amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, APP processing, or beta amyloid (AÎ²) accumulation and argues if an amyloid cascade truly exists, mitochondrial function triggers it. We now review the state of the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, and discuss it in the context of recent AD biomarker studies, diagnostic criteria, and clinical trials. Our hypothesis predicts that biomarker changes reflect brain aging, new AD definitions clinically stage brain aging, and removing brain AÎ² at any point will marginally impact cognitive trajectories. Our hypothesis, therefore, offers unique perspective into what sporadic, late-onset AD is and how to best treat it. 
24120836	Abeta, oxidative stress in Alzheimer disease: evidence based on proteomics studies.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20131009 2014Aug
The initiation and progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex process not yet fully understood. While many hypotheses have been provided as to the cause of the disease, the exact mechanisms remain elusive and difficult to verify. Proteomic applications in disease models of AD have provided valuable insights into the molecular basis of this disorder, demonstrating that on a protein level, disease progression impacts numerous cellular processes such as energy production, cellular structure, signal transduction, synaptic function, mitochondrial function, cell cycle progression, and proteasome function. Each of these cellular functions contributes to the overall health of the cell, and the dysregulation of one or more could contribute to the pathology and clinical presentation in AD. In this review, foci reside primarily on the amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) induced oxidative stress hypothesis and the proteomic studies that have been conducted by our laboratory and others that contribute to the overall understanding of this devastating neurodegenerative disease. 
24189435	Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20131101 2014Aug
Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits extensive oxidative stress throughout the body, being detected peripherally as well as associated with the vulnerable regions of the brain affected in disease. Abundant evidence not only demonstrates the full spectrum of oxidative damage to neuronal macromolecules, but also reveals the occurrence of oxidative events early in the course of the disease and prior to the formation of the pathology, which support an important role of oxidative stress in AD. As a disease of abnormal aging, AD demonstrates oxidative damage at levels that significantly surpass that of elderly controls, which suggests the involvement of additional factor(s). Structurally and functionally damaged mitochondria, which are more proficient at producing reactive oxygen species but less so in ATP, are also an early and prominent feature of the disease. Since mitochondria are also vulnerable to oxidative stress, it is likely that a vicious downward spiral involving the interactions between mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contributes to the initiation and/or amplification of reactive oxygen species that is critical to the pathogenesis of AD. 
23883793	Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 genotype and a physically active lifestyle in late life: analysis of gene-environment interaction for the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease dementia.
Psychol Med 20130724 2014Apr
As physical activity may modify the effect of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 allele on the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, we tested for such a gene-environment interaction in a sample of general practice patients aged â©¾75 years. Data were derived from follow-up waves I-IV of the longitudinal German study on Ageing, Cognition and Dementia in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe). The Kaplan-Meier survival method was used to estimate dementia- and AD-free survival times. Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess individual associations of APOE Îµ4 and physical activity with risk for dementia and AD, controlling for covariates. We tested for gene-environment interaction by calculating three indices of additive interaction. Among the randomly selected sample of 6619 patients, 3327 (50.3%) individuals participated in the study at baseline and 2810 (42.5%) at follow-up I. Of the 2492 patients without dementia included at follow-up I, 278 developed dementia (184 AD) over the subsequent follow-up interval of 4.5 years. The presence of the APOE Îµ4 allele significantly increased and higher physical activity significantly decreased risk for dementia and AD. The co-presence of APOE Îµ4 with low physical activity was associated with higher risk for dementia and AD and shorter dementia- and AD-free survival time than the presence of APOE Îµ4 or low physical activity alone. Indices of interaction indicated no significant interaction between low physical activity and the APOE Îµ4 allele for general dementia risk, but a possible additive interaction for AD risk. Physical activity even in late life may be effective in reducing conversion to dementia and AD or in delaying the onset of clinical manifestations. APOE Îµ4 carriers may particularly benefit from increasing physical activity with regard to their risk for AD. 
25100992	Î²-secretase inhibitor; a promising novel therapeutic drug in Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140721 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia are responsible for up to 90% of dementia cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a staggering number of 35.6 million people are currently diagnosed with dementia. Blocking disease progression or preventing AD altogether is desirable for both social and economic reasons and recently focus has shifted to a new and promising drug: the Î²-secretase inhibitor. Much of AD research has investigated the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which postulates that AD is caused by changes in amyloid beta (AÎ²) stability and aggregation. Blocking AÎ² production by inhibiting the first protease required for its generation, Î²-secretase/BACE1, may be the next step in blocking AD progression. In April 2012, promising phase I data on inhibitor MK-8931 was presented. This drug reduced AÎ² cerebral spinal fluids (CSF) levels up to 92% and was well tolerated by patients. In March 2013 data was added from a one week trial in 32 mild to moderate AD patients, showing CSF AÎ² levels decreased up to 84%. However, Î²-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors require further research. First, greatly reducing AÎ² levels through BACE1 inhibition may have harmful side effects. Second, BACE1 inhibitors have yet to pass clinical trial phase II/III and no data on possible side effects on AD patients are available. And third, there remains doubt about the clinical efficacy of BACE1 inhibitors. In moderate AD patients, AÎ² plaques have already been formed. BACE1 inhibitors prevent production of new AÎ² plaques, but hypothetically do not influence already existing AÎ² peptides. Therefore, BACE1 inhibitors are potentially better at preventing AD instead of having therapeutic use.  
25100990	Cotinine halts the advance of Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and associated depressive-like behavior in Tg6799 mice.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140723 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms for which there are currently no effective therapies. We have previously reported that cotinine, a natural product obtained from tobacco leaves, prevented memory loss and diminished amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaque pathology in transgenic 6799 mice (Tg6799 mice) when treated prior to the development of the pathology. We have also shown that cotinine reduces depressive-like behavior in normal and chronically stressed C57BL/6 mice. Here, we extend our previous studies by investigating the effects of cotinine on the progression of AD-like pathology, depressive-like behavior, and the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects in Tg6799 mice when left untreated until after a more advanced stage of the disease's development. The results show that vehicle-treated Tg6799 mice displayed an accentuated loss of working memory and an abundant AÎ² plaque pathology that were accompanied by higher levels of depressive-like behavior as compared to control littermates. By contrast, prolonged daily cotinine treatment to Tg6799 mice, withheld until after a mid-level progression of AD-like pathology, reduced AÎ² levels/plaques and depressive-like behavior. Moreover, this treatment paradigm dramatically improved working memory as compared to control littermates. The beneficial effects of cotinine were accompanied by an increase in the expression of the active form of protein kinase B and the postsynaptic density protein 95 in the hippocampi and frontal cortices of Tg6799 mice. This suggests that cotinine halts the progression of AD-like pathology while reducing depressive-like behavior by stimulating signaling pathways supporting synaptic plasticity in Tg6799 mice. The potential use of cotinine to treat cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of AD is discussed.  
25100996	Comparison of the effects of transdermal and oral rivastigmine on cognitive function and EEG markers in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140723 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older patients. Rivastigmine (RV, Exelon, Novartis), a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, improves clinical manifestations of AD and may enhance ACh-modulated electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha frequency. This pilot study aimed to determine the effects of two formulations of RV [transdermal patch (RV-TDP) and oral capsules (TV-CP)] on alpha frequency, in particular the posterior dominant rhythm, and cognitive function [assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)] in patients with AD. Subjects with AD were assigned to receive either RV-TDP 10 cm(2) or RV-CP 12 mg/day. All patients underwent EEG recordings at the beginning and end of the 18-month study period using P3, P4, O1, and O2 electrodes, each at high (10.5-13.0 Hz) and low (8.0-10.5 Hz) frequency. MMSE scores were determined at the start of the study (T0) and at three successive 6-month intervals (T1, T2, and T3). RV-TDP administration (n = 10) maintained cognitive function as evidenced by stable MMSE scores from baseline to 18 months (21.07 Â± 2.4-21.2 Â± 3.1) compared with a decrease in MMSE score with RV-CP (n = 10) over 18 months [18.3 Â± 3.6-13.6 Â± 5.06 (adjusted for covariates p = 0.006)]. MMSE scores were significantly different between treatment groups from 6 months (p = 0.04). RV-TDP also increased the spectral power of alpha waves in the posterior region measured with electrode P3 in a significantly great percentage of patients than TV-CP from baseline to 18 months; 80% vs 30%, respectively [p = 0.025 (Ï‡ (2) test)]. RV-TDP was associated with a greater proportion of patients with increased posterior region alpha wave spectral power and significantly higher cognitive function at 18 months, compared with RV-CP treatment. Our findings suggest that RV-TDP provides an effective long-term management option in patients with AD compared with oral RV-CP. This study is a pilot, open-label study with a clear explorative purpose and with a small number of patients. Further randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studies with a bigger sample size as well as healthy controls are needed to support these initial results. 
23891886	The utility of data-driven feature selection: re: Chu et al. 2012.
Neuroimage 20130725 2014Jan1
The recent Chu et al. (2012) manuscript discusses two key findings regarding feature selection (FS): (1) data driven FS was no better than using whole brain voxel data and (2) a priori biological knowledge was effective to guide FS. Use of FS is highly relevant in neuroimaging-based machine learning, as the number of attributes can greatly exceed the number of exemplars. We strongly endorse their demonstration of both of these findings, and we provide additional important practical and theoretical arguments as to why, in their case, the data-driven FS methods they implemented did not result in improved accuracy. Further, we emphasize that the data-driven FS methods they tested performed approximately as well as the all-voxel case. We discuss why a sparse model may be favored over a complex one with similar performance. We caution readers that the findings in the Chu et al. report should not be generalized to all data-driven FS methods.  
24055703	Impact of partial volume effect correction on cerebral Î²-amyloid imaging in APP-Swe mice using [(18)F]-florbetaben PET.
Neuroimage 20130920 2014Jan1
We previously investigated the progression of Î²-amyloid deposition in brain of mice over-expressing amyloid-precursor protein (APP-Swe), a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in a longitudinal PET study with the novel Î²-amyloid tracer [(18)F]-florbetaben. There were certain discrepancies between PET and autoradiographic findings, which seemed to arise from partial volume effects (PVE). Since this phenomenon can lead to bias, most especially in the quantitation of brain microPET studies of mice, we aimed in the present study to investigate the magnitude of PVE on [(18)F]-florbetaben quantitation in murine brain, and to establish and validate a useful correction method (PVEC). Phantom studies with solutions of known radioactivity concentration were performed to measure the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) resolution of the Siemens Inveon DPET and to validate a volume-of-interest (VOI)-based PVEC algorithm. Several VOI-brain-masks were applied to perform in vivo PVEC on [(18)F]-florbetaben data from C57BL/6(N=6) mice, while uncorrected and PVE-corrected data were cross-validated with gamma counting and autoradiography. Next, PVEC was performed on longitudinal PET data set consisting of 43 PET scans in APP-Swe (13-20months) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice using the previously defined masks. VOI-based cortex-to-cerebellum ratios (SUVR) were compared for uncorrected and PVE-corrected results. Brains from a subset of transgenic mice were ultimately examined by autoradiography ex vivo and histochemistry in vitro as gold standard assessments, and compared to VOI-based PET results. The phantom study indicated a FWHM of 1.72mm. Applying a VOI-brain-mask including extracerebral regions gave robust PVEC, with increased precision of the SUVR results. Cortical SUVR increased with age in APP-Swe mice compared to baseline measurements (16months: +5.5%, p&lt;0.005; 20months: +15.5%, p&lt;0.05) with uncorrected data, and to a substantially greater extent with PVEC (16months: +12.2% p&lt;0.005; 20months: +36.4% p&lt;0.05). WT animals showed no binding changes, irrespective of PVEC. Relative to autoradiographic results, the error [%] for uncorrected cortical SUVR was 18.9% for native PET data, and declined to 4.8% upon PVEC, in high correlation with histochemistry results. We calculate that PVEC increases by 10% statistical power for detecting altered [(18)F]-florbetaben uptake in aging APP-Swe mice in planned studies of disease modifying treatments on amyloidogenesis.  
24298149	Neurotransmitter receptor and time dependence of the synaptic plasticity disrupting actions of Alzheimer's disease AÎ² in vivo.
Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. 20131202 2014Jan5
Many endogenous factors influence the time course and extent of the detrimental effects of amyloid Î²-protein (AÎ²) on synaptic function. Here, we assessed the impact of varying endogenous glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission by pharmacological means on the disruption of plasticity at hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses in the anaesthetized rat. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are considered critical in mediating AÎ²-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP). However, intracerebroventricular injection of AÎ²1-42 inhibited not only NMDAR-dependent LTP but also voltage-activated Ca(2+)-dependent LTP induced by strong conditioning stimulation during NMDAR blockade. On the other hand, another form of NMDAR-independent synaptic plasticity, endogenous acetylcholine-induced muscarinic receptor-dependent long-term enhancement, was not hindered by AÎ²1-42. Interestingly, augmenting endogenous acetylcholine activation of nicotinic receptors prior to the injection of AÎ²1-42 prevented the inhibition of NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas the same intervention when introduced after the infusion of AÎ² was ineffective. We also examined the duration of action of AÎ², including water soluble AÎ² from Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Remarkably, the inhibition of LTP induction caused by a single injection of sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable AÎ² dimer-containing AD brain extract persisted for at least a week. These findings highlight the need to increase our understanding of non-NMDAR mechanisms and of developing novel means of overcoming, rather than just preventing, the deleterious synaptic actions of AÎ².  
24298156	Leptin regulation of hippocampal synaptic function in health and disease.
Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. 20131202 2014Jan5
The endocrine hormone leptin plays a key role in regulating food intake and body weight via its actions in the hypothalamus. However, leptin receptors are highly expressed in many extra-hypothalamic brain regions and evidence is growing that leptin influences many central processes including cognition. Indeed, recent studies indicate that leptin is a potential cognitive enhancer as it markedly facilitates the cellular events underlying hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, including effects on glutamate receptor trafficking, neuronal morphology and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the ability of leptin to regulate hippocampal synaptic function markedly declines with age and aberrant leptin function has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we review the evidence supporting a cognitive enhancing role for the hormone leptin and discuss the therapeutic potential of using leptin-based agents to treat AD.  
23375567	AD dementia risk in late MCI, in early MCI, and in subjective memory impairment.
Alzheimers Dement 20130130 2014Jan
To compare the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia in late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), early MCI (EMCI), and subjective memory impairment (SMI) with normal test performance. The baseline sample (n = 2892) of the prospective cohort study in nondemented individuals (German Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia in Primary Care Patients) was divided into LMCI, EMCI, SMI, and control subjects by delayed recall performance. These groups were subdivided by the presence of self-reported concerns associated with experienced memory impairment. AD dementia risk was assessed over 6 years. Across all groups, risk of AD dementia was greatest in LMCI. In those with self-reported concerns regarding their memory impairment, SMI and EMCI were associated with a similarly increased risk of AD dementia. In those subgroups without concerns, SMI was not associated with increased risk of AD dementia, but EMCI remained an at-risk condition. SMI and EMCI with self-reported concerns were associated with the same risk of AD dementia, suggesting that pre-LMCI risk conditions should be extended to SMI with concerns. 
23491263	Changes in plasma amyloid beta in a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130313 2014Jan
A practical biomarker is required to facilitate the preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma amyloid beta (AÎ²)1-40, AÎ²1-42, AÎ²n-40, and AÎ²n-42 peptides were measured at baseline and after 18 months in 771 participants from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging. AÎ² peptide levels were compared with clinical pathology, neuroimaging and neuropsychological measurements. Although inflammatory and renal function covariates influenced plasma AÎ² levels significantly, a decrease in AÎ²1-42/AÎ²1-40 was observed in patients with AD, and was also inversely correlated with neocortical amyloid burden. During the 18 months, plasma AÎ²1-42 decreased in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in those transitioning from healthy to MCI. Our findings are consistent with a number of published plasma AÎ² studies and, although the prognostic value of individual measures in any given subject is limited, the diagnostic contribution of plasma AÎ² may demonstrate utility when combined with a panel of peripheral biomarkers. 
23541187	Association of plasma and cortical amyloid beta is modulated by APOE Îµ4 status.
Alzheimers Dement 20130326 2014Jan
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 allele's role as a modulator of the relationship between soluble plasma amyloid beta (AÎ²) and fibrillar brain AÎ² measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography ([(11)C]PiB PET) has not been assessed. Ninety-six Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with [(11)C]PiB scans and plasma AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 measurements at the time of PET scanning were included. Regional and voxelwise analyses of [(11)C]PiB data were used to determine the influence of APOE Îµ4 allele on association of plasma AÎ²1-40, AÎ²1-42, and AÎ²1-40/AÎ²1-42 with [(11)C]PiB uptake. In APOE Îµ4- but not Îµ4+ participants, positive relationships between plasma AÎ²1-40/AÎ²1-42 and [(11)C]PiB uptake were observed. Modeling the interaction of APOE and plasma AÎ²1-40/AÎ²1-42 improved the explained variance in [(11)C]PiB binding compared with using APOE and plasma AÎ²1-40/AÎ²1-42 as separate terms. The results suggest that plasma AÎ² is a potential Alzheimer's disease biomarker and highlight the importance of genetic variation in interpretation of plasma AÎ² levels. 
23541188	The neuropsychology of normal aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130326 2014Jan
A National Institute on Aging-sponsored work group on preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) articulated the need to characterize cognitive differences between normal aging and preclinical AD. Seventy-one apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 homozygotes, 194 Îµ3/Îµ4 heterozygotes, and 356 Îµ4 noncarriers age 21 to 87 years who were cognitively healthy underwent neuropsychological testing every 2 years. Longitudinal trajectories of test scores were compared between APOE subgroups. There was a significant effect of age on all cognitive domains in both APOE Îµ4 carriers and noncarriers. A significant effect of APOE Îµ4 gene dose was confined to the memory domain and the Dementia Rating Scale. Cross-sectional comparisons did not discriminate the groups. Although cognitive aging patterns are similar in APOE Îµ4 carriers and noncarriers, preclinical AD is characterized by a significant Îµ4 gene dose effect that impacts memory and is detectable longitudinally. Preclinical neuropsychological testing strategies should emphasize memory-sensitive measures and longitudinal design. 
23712002	Cortical phase changes in Alzheimer's disease at 7T MRI: a novel imaging marker.
Alzheimers Dement 20130525 2014Jan
Postmortem studies have indicated the potential of high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize amyloid depositions in the cerebral cortex. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). T2*-weighted MRI was performed in 16 AD patients and 15 control subjects. All magnetic resonance images were scored qualitatively by visual assessment, and quantitatively by measuring phase shifts in the cortical gray matter and hippocampus. Statistical analysis was performed to assess differences between groups. Patients with AD demonstrated an increased phase shift in the cortex in the temporoparietal, frontal, and parietal regions (P &lt; .005), and this was associated with individual Mini-Mental State Examination scores (rÂ =Â -0.54, P &lt; .05). Increased cortical phase shift in AD patients demonstrated on 7-tesla T2*-weighted MRI is a potential new biomarker for AD, which may reflect amyloid pathology in the early stages. 
23871765	The prevalence of dementia in urban and rural areas of China.
Alzheimers Dement 20130718 2014Jan
The Chinese population has been aging rapidly and the country's economy has experienced exponential growth during the past three decades. The goal of this study was to estimate the changes in the prevalence of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) among elderly Chinese individuals and to analyze differences between urban and rural areas. For the years 2008 to 2009, we performed a population-based cross-sectional survey with a multistage cluster sampling design. Residents aged 65 years and older were drawn from 30 urban (n = 6096) and 45 rural (n = 4180) communities across China. Participants were assessed with a series of clinical examinations and neuropsychological measures. Dementia, AD, and VaD were diagnosed according to established criteria via standard diagnostic procedures. The prevalence of dementia, AD, and VaD among individuals aged 65 years and older were 5.14% (95% CI, 4.71-5.57), 3.21% (95% CI, 2.87-3.55), and 1.50% (95% CI, 1.26-1.74), respectively. The prevalence of dementia was significantly higher in rural areas than in urban ones (6.05% vs. 4.40%, P &lt; .001). The same regional difference was also seen for AD (4.25% vs. 2.44%, P &lt; .001) but not for VaD (1.28% vs. 1.61%, P = .166). The difference in AD was not evident when the sample was stratified by educational level. Moreover, the risk factors for AD and VaD differed for urban and rural populations. A notably higher prevalence of dementia and AD was found in rural areas than in urban ones, and education might be an important reason for the urban-rural differences. 
24365657	Developing novel blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease is the public health crisis of the 21st century. There is a clear need for a widely available, inexpensive and reliable method to diagnosis Alzheimer's disease in the earliest stages, track disease progression, and accelerate clinical development of new therapeutics. One avenue ofÂ research being explored is blood based biomarkers. In April 2012, the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation convened top scientists from around the worldÂ toÂ discuss the state of blood based biomarker development. This manuscript summarizes the meeting and the resultant discussion, including potential next steps to move this area of research forward.  
24268828	Impaired emotional memory enhancement on recognition of pictorial stimuli in Alzheimer's disease: no influence of the nature of encoding.
Cortex 20131024 2014Jan
There is some discrepancy in the results regarding emotional enhancement of memory (EEM) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some studies report better retrieval of emotional information, especially positive, than neutral information. This observation is similar to the positivity effect reported in healthy older adults. It was suggested that this effect is due to privileged, deeper and more controlled processing of positive information. One way of testing this is to control both the intention to encode the information and the cognitive resources involved during encoding. Studies investigating EEM in AD patients did not systematically control the nature of encoding. Consequently, the purpose of our study was to examine EEM in AD while manipulating the nature of encoding. Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1 the intention to encode stimuli was manipulated by giving or not giving instructions to participants about the subsequent retrieval. In Experiment 2 cognitive resources involved during encoding were varied (low vs high). In both experiments participants performed immediate recognition task of negative, positive and neutral pictures. 41 mild AD patients and 44 older healthy adults participated in Exp. 1, and 17 mild AD patients and 20 older healthy adults participated in Exp. 2. AD patients did not present EEM. Positivity effect, better performance for positive than neutral and negative pictures was observed with older healthy adults. The data suggest that EEM is disturbed in mild AD patients, with respect to both negative and positive stimuli, at least concerning laboratory, not real-life material. They also suggest there is a positivity effect in healthy older adults and lend support to the idea that this effect is due to preferential cognitive processing of positive information in this population. 
24174335	PET radiotracers for imaging P-glycoprotein: the challenge for early diagnosis in AD.
ChemMedChem 20131031 2014Jan
PET radiotracer development to target in vivo P-glycoprotein (P-gp) could be an important strategy for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, as a dysfunction of P-gp is responsible for the accumulation of Î²-amyloid plaques (a hallmark of AD) in brain parenchyma, P-gp is the cause of AD onset. P-gp substrates and inhibitors are useful for imaging the activity or expression of this protein, respectively; herein we discuss the in vivo evaluation of some Â¹Â¹C radiotracers with P-gp-inhibitory activity, such as [Â¹Â¹C]MC18 and [Â¹Â¹C]MC113, as well as P-gp substrates [Â¹Â¹C]MC266 and [Â¹Â¹C]MC80. Moreover, the radiosynthesis of all these P-gp probes is reported. 
24240736	Neuropathology of cigarette smoking.
Acta Neuropathol. 20131116 2014Jan
It is well established that cigarette smoking is hazardous to health and is a risk factor for many chronic diseases. However, its impact on the brain, whether it be from prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease, is still not very clear. Neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations suggest that there are heterogeneous effects of cigarette smoking on the brain. On the one hand, it is quite clear that cigarette smoking causes damage to endothelial cells, resulting in increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. On the other hand, it seems to be associated with different Alzheimer's pathologies in post-mortem brains and experimental models, despite the fact that epidemiological studies clearly indicate a positive correlation between cigarette smoking and increased risk for AD. Interestingly, cigarette smoking appears to be associated with reduced Parkinson's pathology in post-mortem brains. However, although nicotine in cigarettes may have some neuroprotective actions, the effects of all the other toxic compounds in cigarettes cannot be ignored. It is, therefore, our aim to summarize what is known about the neuropathology of cigarette smoking and, in particular, its implications for neurodegenerative diseases.  
24318124	Neuropathology of stress.
Acta Neuropathol. 20131208 2014Jan
Environmental challenges are part of daily life for any individual. In fact, stress appears to be increasingly present in our modern, and demanding, industrialized society. Virtually every aspect of our body and brain can be influenced by stress and although its effects are partly mediated by powerful corticosteroid hormones that target the nervous system, relatively little is known about when, and how, the effects of stress shift from being beneficial and protective to becoming deleterious. Decades of stress research have provided valuable insights into whether stress can directly induce dysfunction and/or pathological alterations, which elements of stress exposure are responsible, and which structural substrates are involved. Using a broad definition of pathology, we here review the "neuropathology of stress" and focus on structural consequences of stress exposure for different regions of the rodent, primate and human brain. We discuss cytoarchitectural, neuropathological and structural plasticity measures as well as more recent neuroimaging techniques that allow direct monitoring of the spatiotemporal effects of stress and the role of different CNS structures in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in human brain. We focus on the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, key brain regions that not only modulate emotions and cognition but also the response to stress itself, and discuss disorders like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, Cushing syndrome and dementia.  
24762767	[Alzheimer's disease and caregivers experience in home care].
Prof Inferm  2014 Jan-Mar
The aim of this study is to investigate the experience of primary caregivers (men and women) of Alzheimer Disease dementia, in order to tailor program and project to avoid care giving burden. A qualitative phenomenological method was used and the sample was defined by data saturation. Interviews were carried out and recorded in a day care Centre, transcribed verbatim. The analysis was conducted coding common themes and phrases. Six main themes emerged. Our results are similar to those existing in literature, showing care givers as individual in great danger physically and mentally. In the light of the study it is possible to tailor a nursing model in order to improve quality of life and decrease the burden of caregivers, this model should be implemented and analyzed.  
24793188	Antemortem MRI findings associated with microinfarcts at autopsy.
Neurology 20140502 2014Jun3
To determine antemortem MRI findings associated with microinfarcts at autopsy. Patients with microinfarcts (n = 22) and patients without microinfarcts (n = 44) who underwent antemortem MRI were identified from a dementia clinic-based, population-based, and community clinic-based autopsy cohort. The microinfarct and no-microinfarct groups were matched on age at MRI, age at death, sex, APOE status, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Brain infarcts were assessed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. White matter hyperintensities on FLAIR MRI and hippocampal volumes on T1-weighted MRI were quantified using automated methods. A subset of subjects with microinfarcts (n = 15) and a matched group of subjects without microinfarcts (n = 15) had serial T1-weighted MRIs and were included in an analysis of global and regional brain atrophy rates using automated methods. The presence of cortical (p = 0.03) and subcortical (p = 0.02) infarcts on antemortem MRI was associated with presence of microinfarcts at autopsy. Higher numbers of cortical (p = 0.05) and subcortical (p = 0.03) infarcts on antemortem MRI were also associated with presence of microinfarcts. Presence of microinfarcts was not associated with white matter hyperintensities and cross-sectional hippocampal volume on antemortem MRI. Whole-brain and regional precuneus, motor, and somatosensory atrophy rates were higher in subjects with microinfarcts compared to subjects without microinfarcts. Microinfarcts increase brain atrophy rates independent of Alzheimer disease pathology. Association between microinfarct pathology and macroinfarcts on MRI suggests either common risk factors or a shared pathophysiology and potentially common preventive targets. 
24051203	March separate, strike together--role of phosphorylated TAU in mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20130917 2014Aug
The energy demand and calcium buffering requirements of the brain are met by the high number of mitochondria in neurons and in these, especially at the synapses. Mitochondria are the major producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS); at the same time, they are damaged by ROS that are induced by abnormal protein aggregates that characterize human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because synaptic mitochondria are long-lived, any damage exerted by these aggregates impacts severely on neuronal function. Here we review how increased TAU, a defining feature of AD and related tauopathies, impairs mitochondrial function by following the principle: 'March separate, strike together!' In the presence of amyloid-Î², TAU's toxicity is augmented suggesting synergistic pathomechanisms. In order to restore mitochondrial functions in neurodegeneration as a means of therapeutic intervention it will be important to integrate the various aspects of dysfunction and get a handle on targeting distinct cell types and subcellular compartments. 
24503555	Molecular imaging of Alzheimer disease pathology.
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 20140206 2014Jun
Development of molecular imaging agents for fibrillar Î²-amyloid positron-emission tomography during the past decade has brought molecular imaging of Alzheimer disease pathology into the spotlight. Large cohort studies with longitudinal follow-up in cognitively normal individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease indicate that Î²-amyloid deposition can be detected many years before the onset of symptoms with molecular imaging, and its progression can be followed longitudinally. The utility of Î²-amyloid PET in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is greatest when there is no pathologic overlap between 2 dementia syndromes, such as in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer disease. However Î²-amyloid PET alone may be insufficient in distinguishing dementia syndromes that commonly have overlapping Î²-amyloid pathology, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and vascular dementia, which represent the 2 most common dementia pathologies after Alzheimer disease. The role of molecular imaging in Alzheimer disease clinical trials is growing rapidly, especially in an era when preventive interventions are designed to eradicate the pathology targeted by molecular imaging agents. 
24578281	Regional neuronal network failure and cognition in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease.
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 20140227 2014Jun
The severe cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease are associated with structural lesions in gray and white matter in addition to changes in synaptic function. The current investigation studied the breakdown of the structure and function in regional networks involving the Papez circuit and extended neocortical association areas. Cortical volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (3T MR imaging), positron-emission tomography with (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose on a high-resolution research tomograph, and comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed in patients with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease, those with mild cognitive impairment, and elderly healthy controls. Atrophy of the medial temporal lobes was the strongest and most consistent abnormality in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. Atrophy in the temporal, frontal, and parietal regions was most strongly related to episodic memory deficits, while deficits in semantic cognition were also strongly related to reductions of glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex and temporoparietal regions. Changes in fractional anisotropy within white matter tracts, particularly in the left cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, were significantly associated with the cognitive deficits in multiple regression analyses. Posterior cingulate and orbitofrontal metabolic deficits appeared to be related to microstructural changes in projecting white matter tracts. Many lesioned network components within the Papez circuit and extended neocortical association areas were significantly associated with cognitive dysfunction in both mild cognitive impairment and late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease. Hippocampal atrophy was the most prominent lesion, with associated impairment of the uncinate and cingulum white matter microstructures and hippocampal and posterior cingulate metabolic impairment. 
24742809	Various MRS application tools for Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment.
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 20140417 2014Jun
MR spectroscopy is a noninvasive technique that allows the detection of several naturally occurring compounds (metabolites) from well-defined regions of interest within the human brain. Alzheimer disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. During the past 20 years, multiple studies have been performed on MR spectroscopy in patients with both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. Generally, MR spectroscopy studies have found decreased N-acetylaspartate and increased myo-inositol in both patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, with greater changes in Alzheimer disease than in mild cognitive impairment. This review summarizes the information content of proton brain MR spectroscopy and its related technical aspects, as well as applications of MR spectroscopy to mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. While MR spectroscopy may have some value in the differential diagnosis of dementias and assessing prognosis, more likely its role in the near future will be predominantly as a tool for monitoring disease response or progression in treatment trials. More work is needed to evaluate the role of MR spectroscopy as a biomarker in Alzheimer disease and its relationship to other imaging modalities. 
24144963	Plasma nutrient status of patients with Alzheimer's disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Alzheimers Dement 20131019 2014Jul
Alzheimer disease (AD) patients are at risk of nutritional insufficiencies because of physiological and psychological factors. Nutritional compounds are postulated to play a role in the pathophysiological processes that are affected in AD. We here provide the first systematic review and meta-analysis that compares plasma levels of micronutrients and fatty acids in AD patients to those in cognitively intact elderly controls. A secondary objective was to explore the presence of different plasma nutrient levels between AD and control populations that did not differ in measures of protein/energy nourishment. We screened literature published after 1990 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and Embase electronic databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for AD patients, controls, micronutrient, vitamins, and fatty acids, resulting in 3397 publications, of which 80 met all inclusion criteria. Status of protein/energy malnutrition was assessed by body mass index, mini nutritional assessment score, or plasma albumin. Meta-analysis, with correction for differences in mean age between AD patients and controls, was performed when more than five publications were retrieved for a specific nutrient. We identified five or more studies for folate, vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, copper, iron, and zinc but fewer than five studies for vitamins B1 and B6, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, magnesium, manganese, and selenium (the results of the individual publications are discussed). Meta-analysis showed significantly lower plasma levels of folate and vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and vitamin E (P &lt; .001), whereas nonsignificantly lower levels of zinc (P = .050) and vitamin D (P = .075) were found in AD patients. No significant differences were observed for plasma levels of copper and iron. A meta-analysis that was limited to studies reporting no differences in protein/energy malnourishment between AD and control populations yielded similar significantly lower plasma levels of folate and vitamin B12, vitamin C, and vitamin E in AD. The lower plasma nutrient levels indicate that patients with AD have impaired systemic availability of several nutrients. This difference appears to be unrelated to the classic malnourishment that is well known to be common in AD, suggesting that compromised micronutrient status may precede protein and energy malnutrition. Contributing factors might be AD-related alterations in feeding behavior and intake, nutrient absorption, alterations in metabolism, and increased utilization of nutrients for AD pathology-related processes. Given the potential role of nutrients in the pathophysiological processes of AD, the utility of nutrition may currently be underappreciated and offer potential in AD management. 
24239248	Addition of MHPG to Alzheimer's disease biomarkers improves differentiation of dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease but not other dementias.
Alzheimers Dement 20131113 2014Jul
Overlapping clinical features make it difficult to distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementia types. In this study we aimed to determine whether the combination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, amyloid-Î²42 (AÎ²42), total tau protein (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), in combination with 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG), could be useful in discriminating DLB from vascular dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as we previously demonstrated for differentiation of DLB from AD. We retrospectively analyzed concentrations of MHPG, AÎ²42, t-tau, and p-tau in CSF in patients with DLB, AD, VaD, and FTD. Using previously developed multivariate logistic regression models we assessed the diagnostic value of these CSF parameters. The currently used combination of AÎ²42, t-tau, and p-tau yielded a sensitivity of 61.9% and a specificity of 91.7% for the discrimination between DLB and AD, but could not discriminate between DLB and VaD or FTD. The addition of MHPG to AÎ²42, t-tau, and p-tau improves the discrimination of DLB from AD, yielding a sensitivity of 65.1% and specificity of 100%, but could not distinguish DLB from other forms of dementia. Our results confirm in a separate patient cohort that addition of MHPG to AÎ²42, t-tau, and p-tau improves the discrimination of DLB from AD but not the differentiation of DLB from VaD or FTD. 
24985687	Coalition Against Major Diseases/European Medicines Agency biomarker qualification of hippocampal volume for enrichment of clinical trials in predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Jul
Regulatory qualification of a biomarker for a defined context of use provides scientifically robust assurances to sponsors and regulators that accelerate appropriate adoption of biomarkers into drug development. The Coalition Against Major Diseases submitted a dossier to the Scientific Advice Working Party of the European Medicines Agency requesting a qualification opinion on the use of hippocampal volume as a biomarker for enriching clinical trials in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, incorporating a scientific rationale, a literature review and a de novo analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data. The literature review and de novo analysis were consistent with the proposed context of use, and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use released an opinion in November 2011. We summarize the scientific rationale and the data that supported the first qualification of an imaging biomarker by the European Medicines Agency. 
24985689	Justifying reimbursement for Alzheimer's diagnostics and treatments: Seeking alignment on evidence.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Jul
The increasing cost of health care combined with expensive new drugs and diagnostics is leading to more frequent gaps between regulatory and subsequent reimbursement approval decisions. As a result, persons with Alzheimer's disease may have difficulty accessing the benefit of medical advances. In contrast to the long history and established structure for drug approval, payer decision making is dispersed, not standardized, and perspectives on necessary evidence and the evaluation of this evidence differ and are often poorly defined. Particularly challenging is how to demonstrate the value of drugs and diagnostics for patients who do not yet have significant functional decline. Although discussions to develop consensus continue, clinical trials should begin to incorporate health system and patient-oriented outcomes. In some situations, additional studies designed to demonstrate value and comparative effectiveness will be needed. Such studies should examine outcomes of representative populations in community settings. To assure scientific advances in diagnosis and treatment benefit in patients, developing evidence to support reimbursement will become as important as obtaining regulatory approval.  
24756957	Longitudinal effects of intravenous immunoglobulin on Alzheimer's cerebrospinal fluid proteome.
Electrophoresis  2014Jul
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy has shown promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a group of subjects with AD undergoing IVIg immunotherapy are analyzed to identify IVIg-related changes. CSF samples from eight subjects were collected before therapy, after 6 months of therapy, and after a 3-month drug washout period. Samples were analyzed using a gel-based proteomics strategy and IVIg-related changes were determined by gel spot percent volumes. An initial assessment of the data revealed consistent and considerable change in 69 spots. A statistical analysis revealed 79 protein spots with a significant change after 6 months; furthermore, in a subset of these (25), the percent volume change was either maintained or reversed in the washout samples. The proteins that showed a significant change during IVIg therapy, including Ig molecules, gelsolin, transferrin, and transthyretin, have been previously implicated in AD. This study provides preliminary findings regarding a group of CSF proteins that may be associated with the treatment of AD, as well as the potential use of IVIg as an AD immunotherapy. 
25052054	(11)C-PIB-PET for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Cochrane Database Syst Rev 20140723 2014
According to the latest revised National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) (NINCDS-ADRDA) diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease dementia, the confidence in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease dementia is raised with the application of imaging biomarkers. These tests, added to core clinical criteria, might increase the sensitivity or specificity of a testing strategy. However, the accuracy of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. A formal systematic evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity, and other properties of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh Compound-B ((11)C-PIB) ligand was performed. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the (11)C- PIB-PET scan for detecting participants with MCI at baseline who will clinically convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. The most recent search for this review was performed on 12 January 2013. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We also requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (managed by the Cochrane Renal Group).No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used so as to maximise sensitivity. We selected studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI with baseline (11)C-PIB-PET scan. In addition, we only selected studies that applied a reference standard for Alzheimer's dementia diagnosis for example NINCDS-ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria. We screened all titles generated by electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. The identified full papers were assessed for eligibility and data were extracted to create two by two tables. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS 2 tool. We used the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model to produce a summary ROC curve. Conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in nine studies. The quality of the evidence was limited. Of the 274 participants included in the meta-analysis, 112 developed Alzheimer's dementia. Based on the nine included studies, the median proportion converting was 34%. The studies varied markedly in how the PIB scans were done and interpreted.The sensitivities were between 83% and 100% while the specificities were between 46% and 88%. Because of the variation in thresholds and measures of (11)C-PIB amyloid retention, we did not calculate summary sensitivity and specificity. Although subject to considerable uncertainty, to illustrate the potential strengths and weaknesses of (11)C-PIB-PET scans we estimated from the fitted summary ROC curve that the sensitivity was 96% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87 to 99) at the included study median specificity of 58%. This equated to a positive likelihood ratio of 2.3 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07. Assuming a typical conversion rate of MCI to Alzheimer's dementia of 34%, for every 100 PIB scans one person with a negative scan would progress and 28 with a positive scan would not actually progress to Alzheimer's dementia.There were limited data for formal investigation of heterogeneity. We performed two sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of type of reference standard and the use of a pre-specified threshold. There was no effect on our findings. Although the good sensitivity achieved in some included studies is promising for the value of (11)C-PIB-PET, given the heterogeneity in the conduct and interpretation of the test and the lack of defined thresholds for determination of test positivity, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice.(11)C-PIB-PET biomarker is a high cost investigation, therefore it is important to clearly demonstrate its accuracy and standardise the process of the (11)C-PIB diagnostic modality prior to it being widely used. 
25089278	Global epidemiology of dementia: Alzheimer's and vascular types.
Biomed Res Int 20140625 2014
The prevalence of dementia varies substantially worldwide. This is partially attributed to the lack of methodological uniformity among studies, including diagnostic criteria and different mean population ages. However, even after considering these potential sources of bias, differences in age-adjusted dementia prevalence still exist among regions of the world. In Latin America, the prevalence of dementia is higher than expected for its level of population aging. This phenomenon occurs due to the combination of low average educational attainment and high vascular risk profile. Among developed countries, Japan seems to have the lowest prevalence of dementia. Studies that evaluated the immigration effect of the Japanese and blacks to USA evidenced that acculturation increases the relative proportion of AD cases compared to VaD. In the Middle East and Africa, the number of dementia cases will be expressive by 2040. In general, low educational background and other socioeconomic factors have been associated with high risk of obesity, sedentarism, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, all of which also raise the risk of VaD and AD. Regulating these factors is critical to generate the commitment to make dementia a public health priority.  
24746673	Face-name memory in Alzheimer's disease.
Geriatr Nurs 20140417 2014 Jul-Aug
Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects face-name memory, the ability to recognize faces and recall names. Remembering face and name requires a sophisticated cognitive process because of the complexity and similarity among faces and also because of their arbitrary association with names. Assessments of face-name memory can measure episodic and semantic memory performance and are useful for early detection of AD. Improving face-name memory is possible through cognitive interventions targeted to promote procedural memory, which is often preserved until the late stage of AD. This article describes a conceptual model, assessment tools, and strategies for improving face-name memory in persons with AD.  
24374010	Preliminary studies on trigonelline as potential anti-Alzheimer disease agent: Determination by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and modeling of interactions with beta-amyloid.
J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 20131212 2014Oct1
For trigonelline, a quaternary-base pyridine alkaloid of presumed Alzheimer's disease-preventing activity, a method of determination has been proposed, based on the hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). That method might be applied to study the agent's bioavailability, in particular its permeation through blood-brain barrier, which is an inevitable property for the potential central nervous system affecting drugs. Providing that trigonelline possesses the requested pharmacokinetic properties, once attaining pharmacodynamic phase it must interact effectively with the relevant molecular site in the brain, which is characteristic to neurodegenerative diseases, namely the beta-amyloid peptide. Here it was demonstrated by molecular modeling that affinity of trigonelline to the AÎ²(1-42) peptide is high and similar to that of an anti-Alzheimer's disease drug candidate - cotinine.  
24329593	Statewide implementation of "reducing disability in Alzheimer's disease": impact on family caregiver outcomes.
J Gerontol Soc Work 20140624 2014
There have been few replications of efficacious evidence-based programs for dementia caregivers offered in community settings. This study highlights the replication of the evidence-based Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease program and explores the changes in outcomes for participating caregivers and whether those changes are related to level of program utilization. With data from 219 caregivers, regression results indicate that more exercise sessions are associated with a decrease in caregiver strain and more behavior management sessions are associated with a decrease in unmet needs after 3 months. Findings demonstrate how a multicomponent program can have positive benefits for family caregivers.  
24992214	Metabolomic study of lipids in serum for biomarker discovery in Alzheimer's disease using direct infusion mass spectrometry.
J Pharm Biomed Anal 20140523 2014Sep
In this study, we demonstrated the potential of direct infusion mass spectrometry for the lipidomic characterization of Alzheimer's disease. Serum samples were extracted for lipids recovery, and directly analyzed using an electrospray source. Metabolomic fingerprints were subjected to multivariate analysis in order to discriminate between groups of patients and healthy controls, and then some key-compounds were identified as possible markers of Alzheimer's disease. Major differences were found in lipids, although some low molecular weight metabolites also showed significant changes. Thus, important metabolic pathways involved in neurodegeneration could be studied on the basis of these perturbations, such as membrane breakdown (phospholipids and diacylglycerols), oxidative stress (prostaglandins, imidazole and histidine), alterations in neurotransmission systems (oleamide and putrescine) and hyperammonaemia (guanidine and arginine). Moreover, it is noteworthy that some of these potential biomarkers have not been previously described for Alzheimer's disease.  
23597931	Comparison Between Clinical Diagnosis and CSF Biomarkers of Alzheimer Disease in Elderly Patients with Late Onset Psychosis: Helsinki Old Age Psychosis StudyÂ (HOPS).
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130415 2014Sep
To determine the proportion of elderly people with a first psychotic episode actually suffering from dementia, especially Alzheimer disease (AD), by using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Prospective case-control study. Sixty-six patients age 65 years and older with recent psychotic symptoms and 12 comparison subjects with chronic schizophrenia over 10 years that were referred to acute old age psychiatry, in-ward treatment. Concentration levels of CSF AÎ²42, tau and p-tau-181 measured by ELISA compared to clinical diagnosis made by a multiprofessional team of one neurologist and several psychiatrists. The CSF specimen was obtained from 51 (65.4%) of the patients. In five subjects out of 13 with a clinical diagnosis of AD, all the CSF biomarkers (AÎ²42, tau and p-tau) were normal. Only one patient out of 25 with a psychiatric diagnosis and none out of the comparison group with schizophrenia showed a CSF profile typical of AD. Three patients with an AD diagnosis, four patients with a psychiatric diagnosis and one patient with schizophrenia had a low AÎ²42 concentration with normal levels of tau or p-tau. The patients with AD had lower CSF AÎ²42 levels than other patients. The CSF biomarkers are important and useful as part of the diagnostic procedure for detecting AD and other dementia in elderly patients displaying psychotic symptoms. The accuracy of AD diagnosis encounters problems due to atypical behavioural symptoms in psychiatric settings and thus the differential diagnostics can be improved by using CSF biomarkers of AD more frequently. 
23768680	An evaluation of deficits in semantic cueing and proactive and retroactive interference as early features of Alzheimer's disease.
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130612 2014Sep
To determine the degree to which susceptibility to different types of semantic interference may reflect the initial manifestations of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) beyond the effects of global memory impairment. Normal elderly (NE) subjects (nÂ = 47), subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; nÂ = 34), and subjects with probable AD (nÂ = 40) were evaluated by using a unique cued recall paradigm that allowed for evaluation of both proactive and retroactive interference effects while controlling for global memory impairment (i.e., Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning [LASSI-L] procedure). Controlling for overall memory impairment, aMCI subjects had much greater proactive and retroactive interference effects than NE subjects. LASSI-L indices of learning by using cued recall revealed high levels of sensitivity and specificity, with an overall correct classification rate of 90%. These measures provided better discrimination than traditional neuropsychological measures of memory function. The LASSI-L paradigm is unique and unlike other assessments of memory in that items posed for cued recall are explicitly presented, and semantic interference and cueing effects can be assessed while controlling for initial level of memory impairment. This is a powerful procedure that allows the participant to serve as his or her own control. The high levels of discrimination between subjects with aMCI and normal cognition that exceeded traditional neuropsychological measures makes the LASSI-L worthy of further research in the detection of early AD. 
24820446	Age-related iron deposition in the basal ganglia of controls and Alzheimer disease patients quantified using susceptibility weighted imaging.
Arch Gerontol Geriatr 20140418 2014 Sep-Oct
This study aimed to investigate age-related iron deposition changes in healthy subjects and Alzheimer disease patients using susceptibility weighted imaging. The study recruited 182 people, including 143 healthy volunteers and 39 Alzheimer disease patients. All underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and susceptibility weighted imaging sequences. The groups were divided according to age. Phase images were used to investigate iron deposition in the bilateral head of the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus and putamen, and the angle radian value was calculated. We hypothesized that age-related iron deposition changes may be different between Alzheimer disease patients and controls of the same age, and that susceptibility weighted imaging would be a more sensitive method of iron deposition quantification. The results revealed that iron deposition in the globus pallidus increased with age, up to 40 years. In the head of the caudate nucleus, iron deposition peaked at 60 years. There was a general increasing trend with age in the putamen, up to 50-70 years old. There was significant difference between the control and Alzheimer disease groups in the bilateral globus pallidus in both the 60-70 and 70-80 year old group comparisons. In conclusion, iron deposition increased with age in the globus pallidus, the head of the caudate nucleus and putamen, reaching a plateau at different ages. Furthermore, comparisons between the control and Alzheimer disease group revealed that iron deposition changes were more easily detected in the globus pallidus.  
24992196	Latest treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.
Expert Opin Pharmacother 20140703 2014Sep
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) together account for the vast majority of individuals with dementia. Approximately 35 million people worldwide are affected with this condition, and despite decades of research, effective therapies that slow or reverse disease progression have not yet been developed. The recent failure of several large-scale clinical trials is beginning to challenge the magnitude of focus on amyloid-related therapies for AD, and newer drug targets that have shown promise in the laboratory are being investigated in clinical trials. This review summarises the current understanding of the underlying biology of AD, PDD and DLB and outlines the most recent drug candidates in advanced clinical trials. The lack of success in drug discovery for disease-modifying therapies for AD, PDD and DLB can be attributed to limitations in the design of clinical trials and the narrow focus of molecular targets for treatment. New avenues for drug discovery including repositioning and novel target identification may now provide opportunities for success, provided a critical mass of clinical trials is achieved through increased investment. 
25085661	Efficacy of memantine hydrochloride once-daily in Alzheimer's disease.
Expert Opin Pharmacother 20140801 2014Sep
In people with moderate-to-severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) memantine provides some clinical benefits. It is commonly administered twice daily at a maximum dose of 20 mg. To improve medication adherence, convenience of use and to enable a higher daily dose, a 28 mg, extended-release formulation of memantine has been developed. We review the results of a Phase III randomized and controlled trial of memantine extended release as an add-on treatment and compared the findings with a similarly designed previous trial evaluating the immediate release (IR) form. Memantine extended release produced minor benefits on cognitive ability, including verbal fluency, behavioral problems and global clinical assessment. There was no difference between the treatment groups on activities of daily living. The observed effects were not larger than those of the IR formulation tested in a similar setting. The lack of impact on activities of daily living suggests that the small improvements in cognition and behavior did not translate into clinically important changes. In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence that the novel once-daily formulation of memantine represents a significant progress in the clinical management of AD that would justify additional treatment costs. 
25008761	Neuroprotective role of MMP-9 overexpression in the brain of Alzheimer's 5xFAD mice.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20140706 2014Oct
Accumulation of amyloid-Î² (Î‘Î²) peptide is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lowering AÎ² levels in the brain may thus improve synaptic and cognitive deficits observed in AD patients. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, the amyloid-Î² precursor protein (APP) is cleaved within the AÎ² peptide sequence by Î±-secretases, giving rise to the potent neurotrophic N-terminal fragment sÎ‘PPÎ±. We have previously reported that gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), a matrix metalloproteinase critically involved in neuronal plasticity, acts as Î±-secretase both in vitro and in vivo and reduces AÎ² levels in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrate that neuronal overexpression of MMP-9 in a transgenic AD mouse model harboring five familial AD-related mutations (5xFAD) resulted in increased sAPPÎ± levels and decreased AÎ² oligomers without affecting amyloid plaque load in the brain. Functionally, overexpression of MMP-9 prevented the cognitive deficits displayed by 5xFAD mice, an improvement that was accompanied by increased levels of the pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. These results suggest that in vivo activation of endogenous MMP-9 could be a promising target for interference with development and/or progression of AD.  
24593278	Urinary incontinence in patients with Alzheimer's disease: relationship between symptom status and urodynamic diagnoses.
Int. J. Urol. 20140304 2014Jul
To assess factors associated with detrusor overactivity in urinary incontinence patients with Alzheimer's disease, and to determine the correlation between the degree of Alzheimer's disease and the presence of detrusor overactivity. A total of 144 Alzheimer's disease patients (48 men, 96 women; aged 56-97 years) with urinary incontinence were enrolled in this protocol. Cognitive testing was carried out using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, the Global Deterioration Scale and Barthel's Activities of Daily Living. Urinary incontinence was assessed using a frequency-volume chart and the Incontinence Questionnaire on Urinary Incontinence Short Form. All study participants had a urodynamic study carried out. Based on the Incontinence Questionnaire on Urinary Incontinence Short Form, the most common type of urinary incontinence was urge urinary incontinence followed by enuresis in men, whereas women most commonly complained of urge urinary incontinence followed by stress urinary incontinence. Detrusor overactivity was found in 57.6% of patients (25 men, 58 women) on urodynamic study. No statistical differences were found between those with and without detrusor overactivity in terms of age, sex or duration of education. No significant correlation was found between changes in Incontinence Questionnaire on Urinary Incontinence Short Form scores and those in the Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating and Barthel's Activities of Daily Living status. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed the presence of detrusor overactivity could be predicted using Clinical Dementia Rating and Barthel's Activities of Daily Living scores (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05). The most common type of urinary incontinence in patients with Alzheimer's disease is urge urinary incontinence. Clinical Dementia Rating and Barthel's Activities of Daily Living predict the severity of detrusor overactivity in this patient population. 
24875073	Antipsychotic doses among community-dwelling persons with Alzheimer disease in Finland.
J Clin Psychopharmacol  2014Aug
Use of antipsychotics for treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia is frequent among persons with Alzheimer disease (AD). Doses used in long-term therapy have not been previously reported. We describe antipsychotic doses used among community-dwelling persons with AD and investigate factors associated with high-dose use. The MEDALZ-2005 (Medication use and Alzheimer disease) cohort is a nationwide sample including all persons with clinically diagnosed AD at the end of year 2005 in Finland (n = 28,093). Data including prescriptions, comorbidities, and hospital discharge diagnoses were collected from nationwide registers. Antipsychotic doses in monotherapy were investigated during 2006 to 2009. Among 8920 antipsychotic users, 4% (n = 336) used antipsychotics with high dose. Typical antipsychotics were more often used with high dose than atypical antipsychotics. High-dose use was associated with younger age (&lt;80 years) (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.15]), male sex (OR, 1.52; CI, 1.21-1.91), history of psychiatric disorder (OR, 3.25; CI, 2.54-4.15), and inversely associated with Charlson Comorbidity Index score (score 1: OR, 0.74; CI, 0.57-0.97; score â‰¥2: OR, 0.68; CI, 0.47-0.97). In conclusion, the majority of persons with AD used antipsychotics with low or medium dose. Typical antipsychotics were more often used with high dose than atypical antipsychotics, which indicates a need for precise dosing instructions in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Clinicians should regularly assess dosing levels especially among men and those with history of psychiatric disorder.  
24977484	PS dependent APP cleavage regulates glucosylceramide synthase and is affected in Alzheimer's disease.
Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 20140616 2014
Gangliosides were found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we addressed a potential function of Î³-secretase (presenilin) dependent cleavage of the amyloid-precursor-protein (APP) in the regulation of ganglioside de novo synthesis. To identify a potential role of Î³-secretase and APP in ganglioside de novo synthesis we used presenilin (PS) deficient and APP deficient cells and mouse brains, mutated PS as well as transgenic mice and AD post mortem brains. Changes in glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) activity were identified by incorporation of radiolabeled UDP-glucose in glucosylceramide, changes in gene expression via real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Alterations in ganglioside levels were determined by thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry. We found that PS and APP deficiency, in vitro and in vivo, resulted in increased GCS gene expression, elevated enzyme activity and thus increased glucosylceramide and total ganglioside level. Using a specific Î³-secretase inhibitor revealed that PS proteolytic activity alters ganglioside homeostasis. By the use of mutated PS causing early onset AD in cell culture and transgenic mice we found that GCS is increased in AD, further substantiated by the use of AD post mortem brains, suffering from sporadic AD. APP processing regulates ganglioside de novo synthesis and is affected in AD. 
24996793	Distinct perfusion patterns in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.
Eur Radiol 20140705 2014Sep
To compare pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labelled (PCASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measured quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls, in a region of interest (ROI) and voxel-wise fashion. We analysed whole-brain 3D fast-spin-echo PCASL images of 20 FTD patients, 14 DLB patients, 48Â AD patients and 50 controls from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Regional CBF patterns were compared using analyses of variance for repeated measures. Permutation tests were used for voxel-wise comparisons. Analyses were performed using uncorrected and partial volume corrected (PVC) maps. All analyses were corrected for age and sex. There was an interaction between diagnosis and region (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), implying differences in regional CBF changes between diagnostic groups. In AD patients, CBF was decreased in all supratentorial regions, most prominently so in the posterior regions. DLB patients showed lowest CBF values throughout the brain, but temporal CBF was preserved. Supratentorial PVC cortical CBF values were lowest in the frontal lobes in FTD patients, and in the temporal lobes in AD patients. Patients with AD, FTD and DLB display distinct patterns of quantitative regional CBF changes. 3D-PCASL may provide additional value in the workup of dementia patients. â€¢ Patterns of regional CBF changes differ between AD, FTD and DLB patients â€¢ CBF is lower throughout the brain in DLB than AD and FTD â€¢ 3D-PCASL MRI is a potential non-invasive and easily accessible alternative to FDG-PET â€¢ 3D-PCASL MRI may be of additional value in the workup of dementia. 
24848882	A comparison of end-stage renal disease and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly through a comprehensive geriatric assessment.
Int Urol Nephrol 20140522 2014Aug
The percentage of patients receiving haemodialysis (HD) treatment and of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) within the elderly population is increasing day by day. Functional dependence, malnutrition, cognitive impairment or depression impairs the quality of life and increases mortality in both diseases. This study aims to assess HD and AD patients through comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and compare their results. A total of 579 patients (121 HD, 188 AD patients and 270 control subjects) over the age of 65, who were followed at geriatric and nephrology departments between January 2011 and July 2012, were included in this prospective cross-sectional study. Mini-Mental State Examination, Mini-Nutritional Assessment, Geriatric Depression Scale and basic and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living indexes were applied to all patients. The results obtained were compared among the patient groups. The mean age of the participants was 72.6Â Â±Â 8.2. Based on the CGA findings, the results for both groups were considerably different from control group. While depression scores were observed higher in HD patients than in AD patients, cognition, nutrition and functional capacity were mostly affected in AD patients. The management of geriatric HD patients is substantially complex. Depression, cognitive impairment and decrease in functional capacity can often be overlooked, so findings may be ascribed to underlying kidney impairment. Therefore, comprehensive geriatric assessment should be regularly performed in HD patients in order to detect problems at an early stage, to take necessary preventative measures, to initiate treatment as soon as possible and to enhance quality of life. 
24958218	Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Releasing Growth Factors to the CNS: Focus on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.
Mini Rev Med Chem  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) represent the most common neurodegenerative disorders and affect more than 35 million people. Due to the limited effectiveness of available treatments in halting the neurodegenerative process, new therapies, such therapies based on growth factors (GFs), have been investigated. Nevertheless, the efficacies of these new treatments depend not only on the application of neurotrophins but also on the approaches used to deliver these proteins such that they can reach the brain. This review summarises the most widely used drug delivery systems (DDSs) for releasing GFs as possible treatments for AD and PD.  
24055772	Efficient derivation of cortical glutamatergic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells: a model system to study neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20130918 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most prevalent forms of dementia affecting the aging population, and pharmacological therapies to date have not been successful in preventing disease progression. Future therapeutic efforts may benefit from the development of models that enable basic investigation of early disease pathology. In particular, disease-relevant models based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) may be promising approaches to assess the impact of neurotoxic agents in AD on specific neuronal populations and thereby facilitate the development of novel interventions to avert early disease mechanisms. We implemented an efficient paradigm to convert hPSCs into enriched populations of cortical glutamatergic neurons emerging from dorsal forebrain neural progenitors, aided by modulating Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Since AD is generally known to be toxic to glutamatergic circuits, we exposed glutamatergic neurons derived from hESCs to an oligomeric pre-fibrillar forms of AÎ² known as "globulomers", which have shown strong correlation with the level of cognitive deficits in AD. Administration of such AÎ² oligomers yielded signs of the disease, including cell culture age-dependent binding of AÎ² and cell death in the glutamatergic populations. Furthermore, consistent with previous findings in postmortem human AD brain, AÎ²-induced toxicity was selective for glutamatergic rather than GABAeric neurons present in our cultures. This in vitro model of cortical glutamatergic neurons thus offers a system for future mechanistic investigation and therapeutic development for AD pathology using human cell types specifically affected by this disease.  
24524150	Soluble amyloid precursor proteins and secretases as Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.
Trends Mol Med  2014Jan
Recently revised diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease (AD) emphasise the use of biomarkers, heralding a paradigm shift towards a more biological definition of the disorder. Currently available biomarkers offer added diagnostic accuracy in certain situations, but their performance in terms of early diagnostic sensitivity and specificity does not fully live up to the desired standards. One feasible approach to improve the diagnostic and prognostic performance of AD biomarkers is to measure upstream events of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, which are at the core of the initial phase of AD pathogenesis. Here we review evidence on the APP processing enzymes and their cleavage products and discuss possible applications and limitations in their use as AD biomarkers. 
24842003	Deficits in odor-guided behaviors in the transgenic 3xTg-AD female mouse model of Alzheimer×³s disease.
Brain Res. 20140516 2014Jul14
Alzheimer×³s disease (AD) is characterized by a number of alterations including those in cognition and olfaction. An early symptom of AD is decreased olfactory ability, which may affect odor-guided behaviors. To test this possibility we evaluated alterations in sexual incentive motivation, sexual olfactory preference, sexual olfactory discrimination, nursing-relevant olfactory preference and olfactory discrimination in female mice. We tested 3xTg-AD (a triple transgenic model, which is a "knock in" of PS1M146V, APPSwe, and tauP300L) and wild type (WT) female mice when receptive (estrous) and non-receptive (anestrous). Subjects were divided into three groups of different ages: (1) 4-5 months, (2) 10-11 months, and (3) 16-18 months. In the sexual incentive motivation task, the receptive 3xTg-AD females showed no preference for a sexually active male at any age studied, in contrast to the WT females. In the sexual olfactory preference test, the receptive WT females were able to identify sexually active male secretions at all ages, but the oldest (16-18 months old) 3xTg-AD females could not. In addition, the oldest 3xTg-AD females showed no preference for nursing-relevant odors in dam secretions and were unable to discriminate between cinnamon and strawberry odors, indicating olfactory alterations. Thus, the present study suggests that the olfactory deficits in this mouse model are associated with changes in sexual incentive motivation and discrimination of food-related odors.  
24237400	Preparation and characterization of methylene blue nanoparticles for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.
Curr Drug Deliv  2014
Methylene blue (MB) has been shown to slow down the progression of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies; however distribution of MB into the brain is limited due its high hydrophilicity. In this study, we aimed to prepare novel hydrophobic glutathione coated PLGA nanoparticles to improve bioavailability of MB in the brain. Glutathione coated poly-(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-b-PEG) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared and tested in two different cell culture models of AD expressing microtubule associated protein tau (tau). The NPs showed a particle size averaging 136.5Â±4.4nm, which is suitable for the blood brain barrier (BBB) permeation. The in vitro release profile of the NPs exhibited no initial burst release and showed sustained drug release for up to 144 hours. Interestingly, treatment of newly formulated MB-NPs showed a potent reduction in both endogenous and over expressed tau protein levels in human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells expressing endogenous tau and transfected HeLa cells over-expressing tau protein, respectively. Furthermore, in vitro BBB Transwell(TM) study showed significantly higher permeation of MB-NP compared to the MB solution through the co culture of rat brain endothelial 4 (RBE4) and C6 astrocytoma cells (p&lt;0.05). The proposed MB loaded nanoparticles could provide a more effective treatment option for AD and many other related disorders.  
25089527	Engineering neprilysin activity and specificity to create a novel therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140804 2014
Neprilysin is a transmembrane zinc metallopeptidase that degrades a wide range of peptide substrates. It has received attention as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease due to its ability to degrade the peptide amyloid beta. However, its broad range of peptide substrates has the potential to limit its therapeutic use due to degradation of additional peptides substrates that tightly regulate many physiological processes. We sought to generate a soluble version of the ectodomain of neprilysin with improved activity and specificity towards amyloid beta as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease. Extensive amino acid substitutions were performed at positions surrounding the active site and inner surface of the enzyme and variants screened for activity on amyloid beta 1-40, 1-42 and a variety of other physiologically relevant peptides. We identified several mutations that modulated and improved both enzyme selectivity and intrinsic activity. Neprilysin variant G399V/G714K displayed an approximately 20-fold improved activity on amyloid beta 1-40 and up to a 3,200-fold reduction in activity on other peptides. Along with the altered peptide substrate specificity, the mutant enzyme produced a markedly altered series of amyloid beta cleavage products compared to the wild-type enzyme. Crystallisation of the mutant enzyme revealed that the amino acid substitutions result in alteration of the shape and size of the pocket containing the active site compared to the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzyme offers the potential for the more efficient degradation of amyloid beta in vivo as a therapeutic for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  
25089827	A physically-modified saline suppresses neuronal apoptosis, attenuates tau phosphorylation and protects memory in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140804 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia in the aging population, is characterized by the presence of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and extensive neuronal apoptosis. Neuritic plaques are mainly composed of aggregates of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) protein while neurofibrillary tangles are composed of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite intense investigations, no effective therapy is currently available to halt the progression of this disease. Here, we have undertaken a novel approach to attenuate apoptosis and tau phosphorylation in cultured neuronal cells and in a transgenic animal model of AD. RNS60 is a 0.9% saline solution containing oxygenated nanobubbles that is generated by subjecting normal saline to Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille (TCP) flow under elevated oxygen pressure. In our experiments, fibrillar AÎ²1-42, but not the reverse peptide AÎ²42-1, induced apoptosis and cell death in human SHSY5Y neuronal cells. RNS60, but not NS (normal saline), RNS10.3 (TCP-modified saline without excess oxygen) or PNS60 (saline containing excess oxygen without TCP modification), attenuated AÎ²(1-42)-induced cell death. RNS60 inhibited neuronal cell death via activation of the type 1A phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase - Akt - BAD pathway. Furthermore, RNS60 also decreased AÎ²(1-42)-induced tau phosphorylation via (PI-3 kinase - Akt)-mediated inhibition of GSK-3Î². Similarly, RNS60 treatment suppressed neuronal apoptosis, attenuated Tau phosphorylation, inhibited glial activation, and reduced the burden of AÎ² in the hippocampus and protected memory and learning in 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of AD. Therefore, RNS60 may be a promising pharmaceutical candidate in halting or delaying the progression of AD.  
25089901	Elevated mRNA-Levels of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone and Its Receptor in Plaque-Bearing Alzheimer's Disease Transgenic Mice.
PLoS ONE 20140804 2014
Research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has indicated an association between hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and cognitive senescence, indicating that post meno-/andropausal changes in HPG axis hormones are implicated in the neuropathology of AD. Studies of transgenic mice with AD pathologies have led to improved understanding of the pathophysiological processes underlying AD. The aims of this study were to explore whether mRNA-levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gnrh) and its receptor (Gnrhr) were changed in plaque-bearing Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice and to investigate whether these levels and amyloid plaque deposition were downregulated by treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (Gnrh-a; Leuprorelin acetate). The study was performed on mice carrying the Arctic and Swedish amyloid-Î² precursor protein (AÎ²PP) mutations (tgArcSwe). At 12 months of age, female tgArcSwe mice showed a twofold higher level of Gnrh mRNA and more than 1.5 higher level of Gnrhr mRNA than age matched controls. Male tgArcSwe mice showed the same pattern of changes, albeit more pronounced. In both sexes, Gnrh-a treatment caused significant down-regulation of Gnrh and Gnrhr mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry combined with quantitative image analysis revealed no significant changes in the plaque load after Gnrh-a treatment in hippocampus and thalamus. However, plaque load in the cerebral cortex of treated females tended to be lower than in female vehicle-treated mice. The present study points to the involvement of hormonal changes in AD mice models and demonstrates that these changes can be effectively counteracted by pharmacological treatment. Although known to increase in normal aging, our study shows that Gnrh/Gnrhr mRNA expression increases much more dramatically in tgArcSwe mice. Treatment with Leuprorelin acetate successfully abolished the transgene specific effects on Gnrh/Gnrhr mRNA expression. The present experimental approach should serve as a platform for further studies on the usefulness of Gnrh-a treatment in suppressing plaque development in AD.  
24821011	Synthesis and characterization of 1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole derivatives as multifunctional agents for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20140510 2014Sep
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder that is characterized by dementia, cognitive impairment, and memory loss. Diverse factors are related to the development of AD, such as increased level of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²), acetylcholine, metal ion deregulation, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and oxidative stress. The following methods were used: organic syntheses of 1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole derivatives, inhibition of self-mediated and metal-induced AÎ²1-42 aggregation, inhibition studies for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, anti-oxidation activity studies, CD, MTT assay, transmission electron microscopy, dot plot assay, gel electrophoresis, Western blot, and molecular docking studies. We synthesized and characterized a new type of 1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole derivatives as multifunctional agents for AD treatment. Our results showed that most of these derivatives exhibited strong AÎ² aggregation inhibitory activity. Compound 9g had 74% AÎ²1-42 aggregation inhibitory effect at 10Î¼M concentration with its IC50 value of 6.5Î¼M for self-induced AÎ²1-42 aggregation. This compound also showed good inhibition of metal-mediated (Cu(2+) and Fe(2+)) and acetylcholinesterase-induced AÎ²1-42 aggregation, as indicated by using thioflavin T assay, transmission electron microscopy, gel electrophoresis, and Western blot. Besides, compound 9g exhibited cholinesterase inhibitory activity, with its IC50 values of 0.86Î¼M and 0.51Î¼M for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, respectively. In addition, compound 9g showed good anti-oxidation effect with oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value of 2.29. Compound 9g was found to be a potent multi-target-directed agent for Alzheimer's disease. Compound 9g could become a lead compound for further development as a multi-target-directed agent for AD treatment. 
24492993	Environmental enrichment eliminates the anxiety phenotypes in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci  2014Sep
Although the impacts of environmental enrichment (EE) in several genetic models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been documented, the focus has remained predominantly on cognition. Few have investigated the expression of emotional phenotypes that mimic the notable affective features in AD. Here, we studied the interaction between EE and the coexpression of three genetic risk factors (mutations) for AD. In a longitudinal design, 3Ã—Tg-AD mutants and wild type controls were compared at 6-7 months and subsequently at 12-13 months of age. Under standard housing, phenotypes of heightened anxiety levels were identified in the 3Ã—Tg-AD mice in the elevated plus maze and open-field tests. Such trait differences between genotypes were substantially diminished under EE housing, which was attributable to the anxiolytic impact of EE on the mutant mice as much as the anxiogenic impact of EE on the wild type mice. In contrast, the phenotypes in learned fear were not significantly modified by EE in the tests of Pavlovian freezing and conditioned active avoidance conducted at either age. Rearing under EE thus has uncovered a novel distinction between innate and acquired expressions of fear response in the 3Ã—Tg-AD mouse model that might be relevant to the mental health management of AD.  
24933410	Quantitative EEG in Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive state, resting state and association with disease severity.
Int J Psychophysiol 20140614 2014Sep
Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) recorded during cognitive tasks has been shown to differentiate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy individuals. However, the association between various qEEG markers recorded during mnestic paradigms and clinical measures of AD has not been studied in detail. To evaluate if 'cognitive' qEEG is a useful diagnostic option, particularly if memory paradigms are used as cognitive stimulators. This study is part of the Prospective Registry on Dementia in Austria (PRODEM), a multicenter dementia research project. A cohort of 79 probable AD patients was included in a cross-sectional analysis. qEEG recordings performed in resting states were compared with recordings during cognitively active states. Cognition was evoked with a face-name paradigm and a paired-associate word list task, respectively. Relative band powers, coherence and auto-mutual information were computed as functions of MMSE scores for the memory paradigms and during rest. Analyses were adjusted for the co-variables age, sex, duration of dementia and educational level. MMSE scores explained 36-51% of the variances of qEEG-markers. Face-name encoding with eyes open was superior to resting state with eyes closed in relative theta and beta1 power as well as coherence, whereas relative alpha power and auto-mutual information yielded more significant results during resting state with eyes closed. The face-name task yielded stronger correlations with MMSE scores than the verbal memory task. qEEG alterations recorded during mnestic activity, particularly face-name encoding showed the highest association with the MMSE and may serve as a clinically valuable marker for disease severity. 
24553879	Obesity as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease: the role of adipocytokines.
Metab Brain Dis 20140220 2014Sep
Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. It is an aging-related multi-factorial disorder and growing evidence support the contribution of metabolic factors to what was formerly thought to be a centrally mediated process. Obesity has already been recognized as an important player in the pathogenesis of this type of dementia, independently of insulin resistance or other vascular risk factors. Although the exact underlying mechanisms are still unknown, adipocyte dysfunction and concomitant alteration in adipocyte-derived protein secretion seem to be involved, since these adipocytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier and influence cognitive-related structures. Very few studies have assessed the role of adipocytokines dysfunction on cognitive impaired patients and yielded contradictory results. Interestingly, extensive research on the central effects of leptin in Alzheimer's disease-transgenic mice has demonstrated its capacity to enhance synaptic plasticity and strength, as well as to prevent beta-amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation. In addition, adiponectin, the most abundant adipocytokine whose levels are inversely correlated to adiposity, has shown to be neuroprotective to hippocampal cells. Many other adipose-derived cytokines have mainly pro-inflammatory properties, being able to trigger and/or enhance central inflammatory cascades and also to influence the secretion of other adipocytokines involved in cognition. This paper pretends to review the existing evidence on the contribution of adipocytokines dysfunction to the increased risk of dementia associated with mid-life obesity, unraveling its insulin-independent effects on cognition.  
24664180	Brain metabolite clearance: impact on Alzheimer's disease.
Metab Brain Dis 20140325 2014Sep
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder often associated with aging and characterized by several critical molecular changes that take place in the brain. Among the molecular hallmarks of AD, increased levels of amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) and the subsequent AÎ²-derived damage are the most well-studied factors; however, despite the large amounts of effort and resources devoted to the study of AD and AD pathophysiology, the scientific community still awaits therapeutic alternatives capable of ensuring a better outcome for AD patients. In 2012, Cramer et al. (Science 335:1503-1506 2012) astonished the scientific community by rescuing behavioral and cognitive impairments in AD mouse models via oral administration of bexarotene, a drug used to treat some types of skin cancer. Moreover, these authors demonstrated that bexarotene, a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, exerts major effects on AÎ² levels, mainly through increased apolipoprotein E (ApoE) expression. Apart from the valid questions addressed in Cramer's work, only a few attempts have been made to explain the effects of bexarotene. Most of these explanations have been solely based on the ability of bexarotene to reduce AÎ² levels and not on the mechanisms that lead to such a reduction. Although it is well known that an imbalance in the AÎ² production/excretion rate is the basis of increased AÎ² levels in AD, no further explanations have been proposed to address the potential involvement of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a critical AÎ²-clearance structure, in the bexarotene-mediated effects. Moreover, no attempt has been made to explain how the different effects observed after bexarotene administration are connected to each other. Based on current information and on our own experience with nuclear receptors (NR), we offer new perspectives on the mechanisms of bexarotene action, which should help to improve our knowledge of NRs.  
24588894	TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathology in Alzheimer's disease with psychosis.
Int Psychogeriatr 20140304 2014Jun
TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been identified as a major disease protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. More recently, TDP-43 proteinopathy has also been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a characteristic distribution of TDP-43 predominantly in the mesial temporal lobe, and to a lesser degree in the neocortical areas. AD subjects with psychotic symptoms (AD+P) represent a subgroup characterized by greater impairment of frontal cortex-dependent cognitive functions and more severe frontal cortical neuropathology. The aim of this study is to determine whether there is an association between TDP-43 pathology and AD+P. We hypothesized that TDP-43 pathology would be more frequent in AD+P than in AD without psychosis. We studied the presence and distribution of TDP-43 pathology by immunohistochemistry in the dentate gyrus (DG) and prefrontal cortex (FC) of postmortem brain specimens from 68 subjects with a primary neuropathologic diagnosis of AD as determined by the Neuropathology Core of the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Forty-five (66%) subjects were classified as AD+P. Fourteen (20.6%) subjects had TDP-43 pathology in DG, eight (11.8%) had TDP-43 pathology in FC, and six (8.8%) had TDP-43 pathology in both regions. TDP-43 in DG was not significantly associated with AD+P. However, TDP-43 in FC demonstrated a trend toward reduced likelihood of psychosis (p = 0.068). TDP-43 pathology in DG, but not FC, was significantly associated with greater age at death and longer duration of illness. Our findings indicate that there was no association between concomitant TDP-43 pathology in DG or FC and AD+P. 
24719484	Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide is reduced in Alzheimer disease.
Neurology 20140409 2014May13
There is growing evidence that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology in animal models, but human studies are needed. We studied the brains of patients with pathologically confirmed late-onset AD and age-matched cognitively normal (CN) subjects to investigate the expression of PACAP messenger RNA (34 AD and 14 CN) and protein (12 AD and 11 CN) in a case-control study. We report that PACAP levels are reduced in multiple brain regions, including the entorhinal cortex, the middle temporal gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the primary visual cortex. This reduction is correlated with higher amyloid burden (CERAD plaque density) in the entorhinal cortex and superior frontal gyrus but not in the primary visual cortex, a region spared in most cases of AD. PACAP expression is lower in advanced Braak stages (V and VI) than in moderate stages (III and IV). Increased PACAP levels are associated with decreased scores on the Dementia Rating Scale, a global cognitive measure. Finally, CSF levels paralleled brain levels in AD but not in Parkinson dementia or frontotemporal dementia brains. The close relationship between PACAP reduction and the severity of AD pathology suggests that downregulation of PACAP may contribute to AD pathogenesis. 
24731519	Psychotic Alzheimer's disease is associated with gender-specific tau phosphorylation abnormalities.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140306 2014Sep
Converging evidence suggests that psychotic Alzheimer's disease (AD + P) is associated with an acceleration of frontal degeneration, with tau pathology playing a primary role. Previous histopathologic and biomarker studies have specifically implicated tau pathology in this condition. To precisely quantify tau abnormalities in the frontal cortex in AD + P, we used a sensitive biochemical assay of total tau and 4 epitopes of phospho-tau relevant in AD pathology in a postmortem sample of AD + P and AD - P. Samples of superior frontal gyrus from 26 AD subjects without psychosis and 45 AD + P subjects with psychosis were analyzed. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrate that AD + P females, but not males, had significantly higher levels of phosphorylated tau in the frontal cortex. In males, but not females, AD + P was associated with the presence of Î±-synuclein pathology. These results support a gender dissociation of pathology in AD + P. The design of future studies aimed at the elucidation of cognitive and/or functional outcomes; regional brain metabolic deficits; or genetic correlates of AD + P should take gender into consideration. 
24971004	Add-on prolonged-release melatonin for cognitive function and sleep in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial.
Clin Interv Aging 20140618 2014
A link between poor sleep quality and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently been suggested. Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients. The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52-85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured. Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI â‰¥6) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus -3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (-3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo. Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline. 
24972054	High resolution imaging study of interactions between the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor and APP, beta-secretase and gamma-secretase in Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140627 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia affecting the elderly. Neurodegeneration is caused by the amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide which is generated from the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by the Î²- and Î³- secretases. Previous reports revealed that the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) is involved in APP processing, however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs remains largely unclear. This study sought to assess whether LRP/LR interacted with APP, Î²- or Î³-secretase. Detailed confocal microscopy revealed that LRP/LR showed a strong co-localisation with APP, Î²- and Î³-secretase, respectively, at various sub-cellular locations. Superresolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM) showed that interactions were unlikely between LRP/LR and APP and Î²-secretase, respectively, while there was strong co-localisation between LRP/LR and Î³-secretase at this 80 nm resolution. FRET was further employed to assess the possibility of protein-protein interactions and only an interaction between LRP/LR and Î³-secretase was found. FLAG co-immunoprecipitation confirmed these findings as LRP/LR co-immunoprecipitated with Î³-secretase, but failed to do so with APP. These findings indicate that LRP/LR exerts its influence on AÎ² shedding via a direct interaction with the Î³-secretase and possibly an indirect interaction with the Î²-secretase.  
25019089	Development of dual inhibitors against Alzheimer's disease using fragment-based QSAR and molecular docking.
Biomed Res Int 20140612 2014
Alzheimer's (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among elderly people. Considering the complex heterogeneous etiology of AD, there is an urgent need to develop multitargeted drugs for its suppression. Î²-amyloid cleavage enzyme (BACE-1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), being important for AD progression, have been considered as promising drug targets. In this study, a robust and highly predictive group-based QSAR (GQSAR) model has been developed based on the descriptors calculated for the fragments of 20 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) derivatives. A large combinatorial library of DHP analogues was created, the activity of each compound was predicted, and the top compounds were analyzed using refined molecular docking. A detailed interaction analysis was carried out for the top two compounds (EDC and FDC) which showed significant binding affinity for BACE-1 and AChE. This study paves way for consideration of these lead molecules as prospective drugs for the effective dual inhibition of BACE-1 and AChE. The GQSAR model provides site-specific clues about the molecules where certain modifications can result in increased biological activity. This information could be of high value for design and development of multifunctional drugs for combating AD.  
25061285	Estrogen receptor Î± gene polymorphisms and risk of Alzheimer's disease: evidence from a meta-analysis.
Clin Interv Aging 20140630 2014
Human estrogen receptor Î± (ESR1), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, is one of the key mediators of hormonal response in estrogen-sensitive tissues. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that two of the most widely studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ESR1 - PvuII (T/C, rs223493) and Xbal (A/G, rs9340799) - are possibly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, individual study results are still controversial. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Science Direct, SpringerLink, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for eligible studies assessing the association of ESR1 polymorphisms and AD risk (last search performed in November 2013). Thereafter, a meta-analysis of 13,192 subjects from 18 individual studies was conducted to evaluate the association between ESR1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to AD. The results indicated that a significant association was found between the ESR1 PvuII polymorphism and AD risk in Caucasian populations (CC + CT versus TT, odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.28, P=0.03; CT versus TT, OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.31, P=0.02), whereas no evidence of association was found in Asian populations. Nevertheless, we did not find any significant association between the ESR1 XbaI polymorphism and AD risk for any model in Caucasian and Asian populations (all P&gt;0.05). Based on this meta-analysis, we conclude that the ESR1 PvuII polymorphism might be a risk factor in AD development in Caucasian populations, not in Asian populations. Further confirmation is needed from better-designed and larger studies. 
25075180	Altered diastolic function and aortic stiffness in Alzheimer's disease.
Clin Interv Aging 20140716 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely linked to cardiovascular risk factors. Echocardiographic studies were performed, including left ventricular diastolic functions, left and right atrial conduction times, and arterial stiffness parameters, namely stiffness index, pressure-strain elastic modulus, and distensibility, on 29 patients with AD and 24 age-matched individuals with normal cognitive function. The peak mitral flow velocity of the early rapid filling wave (E) was lower, and the peak velocity of the late filling wave caused by atrial contraction (A), deceleration time of peak E velocity, and isovolumetric relaxation time were higher in the AD group. The early myocardial peak (Ea) velocity was significantly lower in AD patients, whereas the late diastolic (Aa) velocity and E/Ea ratio were similar between the two groups. In Alzheimer patients, stiffness index and pressure-strain elastic modulus were higher, and distensibility was significantly lower in the AD group compared to the control. Interatrial electromechanical delay was significantly longer in the AD group. Our findings suggest that patients with AD are more likely to have diastolic dysfunction, higher atrial conduction times, and increased arterial stiffness compared to the controls of same sex and similar age. 
24973918	GABA from reactive astrocytes impairs memory in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Nat. Med. 20140629 2014Aug
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), memory impairment is the most prominent feature that afflicts patients and their families. Although reactive astrocytes have been observed around amyloid plaques since the disease was first described, their role in memory impairment has been poorly understood. Here, we show that reactive astrocytes aberrantly and abundantly produce the inhibitory gliotransmitter GABA by monoamine oxidase-B (Maob) and abnormally release GABA through the bestrophin 1 channel. In the dentate gyrus of mouse models of AD, the released GABA reduces spike probability of granule cells by acting on presynaptic GABA receptors. Suppressing GABA production or release from reactive astrocytes fully restores the impaired spike probability, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory in the mice. In the postmortem brain of individuals with AD, astrocytic GABA and MAOB are significantly upregulated. We propose that selective inhibition of astrocytic GABA synthesis or release may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for treating memory impairment in AD.  
24176625	Cholinergic basal forebrain atrophy predicts amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131028 2014Mar
We compared accuracy of hippocampus and basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS) atrophy to predict cortical amyloid burden in 179 cognitively normal subjects (CN), 269 subjects with early stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 136 subjects with late stages of MCI, and 86 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Hippocampus and BFCS volumes were determined from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at 3 Tesla, and cortical amyloid load from AV45 (florbetapir) positron emission tomography scans. In receiver operating characteristics analyses, BFCS volume provided significantly more accurate classification into amyloid-negative and -positive categories than hippocampus volume. In contrast, hippocampus volume more accurately identified the diagnostic categories of AD, late and early MCI, and CN compared with whole and anterior BFCS volume, whereas posterior BFCS and hippocampus volumes yielded similar diagnostic accuracy. In logistic regression analysis, hippocampus and posterior BFCS volumes contributed significantly to discriminate MCI and AD from CN, but only BFCS volume predicted amyloid status. Our findings suggest that BFCS atrophy is more closely associated with cortical amyloid burden than hippocampus atrophy in predementia AD.  
23413044	Use of magnetization transfer contrast MRI to detect early molecular pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
Magn Reson Med 20130214 2014Jan
The purpose of this study was to determine if magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) imaging could be used to detect early macromolecular accumulation in a mouse model of early Alzheimer's disease. We obtained MTC images at 9.4 T at three different age points in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The Tg2576 mouse exhibits increased amyloid beta deposition that eventually progresses into amyloid beta plaque formation, increased hyper-phosphorylated tau but does not exhibit neurodegeneration. Our results show an increase in the MTC signal that predates plaque formation and reported learning and memory deficits in the Tg2576 mouse. This increase in the MTC signal was reversed in a model of antioxidant therapy. MTC magnetic resonance imaging can be used to detect early macromolecular changes in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The source of the MTC contrast is likely complex and warrants further investigation in additional preclinical models that represent early and late stage Alzheimer's disease pathologies. 
23763450	Psychometric evaluation of ADAS-Cog and NTB for measuring drug response.
Acta Neurol. Scand. 20130613 2014Feb
To conduct a psychometric analysis to determine the adequacy of instruments that measure cognition in Alzheimer's disease trials. Both the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog) and the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) are validated outcome measures for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease and are approved also for regulatory purposes. However, it is not clear how comparable they are in measuring cognitive function. In fact, many recent trials in Alzheimer's disease patients have failed and it has been questioned if ADAS-Cog still is a sensitive measure. The present paper examines the psychometric properties of ADAS-Cog and NTB, based on a post hoc analysis of data from a clinical trial (NCT01024660), which was conducted by AstraZeneca, in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total score 16-24. Acceptability, reliability, different types of validity and ability to detect change were assessed using relevant statistical methods. Total scores of both tests, as well as separate domains of both tests, including the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Verbal Fluency Condition, were analyzed. Overall, NTB performed well, with acceptable reliability and ability to detect change, while ADAS-Cog had insufficient psychometric properties, including ceiling effects in 8 out of a total of 11 ADAS-Cog items in mild AD patients, as well as low test-retest reliability in some of the items. Based on a direct comparison on the same patient sample, we see advantages of the NTB compared with the ADAS-Cog for the evaluation of cognitive function in the population of mild-to-moderate AD patients. The results suggest that not all of ADAS-Cog items are relevant for both mild and moderate AD population. This validation study demonstrates satisfactory psychometric properties of the NTB, while ADAS-Cog was found to be psychometrically inadequate. 
24366271	Sleep and Alzheimer disease pathology--a bidirectional relationship.
Nat Rev Neurol 20131224 2014Feb
Factors other than age and genetics may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD). Accumulation of the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide in the brain seems to initiate a cascade of key events in the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, evidence is emerging that the sleep-wake cycle directly influences levels of AÎ² in the brain. In experimental models, sleep deprivation increases the concentration of soluble AÎ² and results in chronic accumulation of AÎ², whereas sleep extension has the opposite effect. Furthermore, once AÎ² accumulates, increased wakefulness and altered sleep patterns develop. Individuals with early AÎ² deposition who still have normal cognitive function report sleep abnormalities, as do individuals with very mild dementia due to AD. Thus, sleep and neurodegenerative disease may influence each other in many ways that have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.  
24378367	The role of clusterin in amyloid-Î²-associated neurodegeneration.
JAMA Neurol  2014Feb
Converging evidence indicates that clusterin, a chaperone glycoprotein, influences Alzheimer disease neurodegeneration. However, the precise role of clusterin in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis is still not well understood. To elucidate the relationship between clusterin, amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and the rate of brain atrophy over time among nondemented older individuals. This longitudinal cohort included cognitively normal older participants and individuals with mild cognitive impairment assessed with baseline lumbar puncture and longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging. We examined 241 nondemented older individuals from research centers across the United States and Canada (91 participants with a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 and 150 individuals with a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5). Using linear mixed-effects models, we investigated interactions between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin, CSF AÎ²1-42, and CSF p-tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181p) on the atrophy rate of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Across all participants, we found a significant interaction between CSF clusterin and CSF AÎ²1-42 on the entorhinal cortex atrophy rate but not on the hippocampal atrophy rate. Cerebrospinal fluid clusterin was associated with the entorhinal cortex atrophy rate among CSF AÎ²1-42-positive individuals but not among CSF AÎ²1-42-negative individuals. In secondary analyses, we found significant interactions between CSF AÎ²1-42 and CSF clusterin, as well as CSF AÎ²1-42 and CSF p-tau181p, on the entorhinal cortex atrophy rate. We found similar results in subgroup analyses within the mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal cohorts. In nondemented older individuals, AÎ²-associated volume loss occurs in the presence of elevated clusterin. The effect of clusterin on AÎ²-associated brain atrophy is not confounded or explained by p-tau. These findings implicate a potentially important role for clusterin in the earliest stages of the Alzheimer disease neurodegenerative process and suggest independent effects of clusterin and p-tau on AÎ²-associated volume loss. 
24566363	Why calcium channel blockers could be an elite choice in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a comprehensive review of evidences.
Rev Neurosci  2014
The universality and vitality of calcium ions are implicit from its diverse physiological functions, from regulation of enzymes to synaptic plasticity and memory. However, overloading of these ions could result in life-threatening degenerative disorders. Calcium channels, which are involved in the transport of calcium ions, are targeted and blocked to prevent its overload, favoring vascular relaxation. Besides this primary action, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) also genuinely exhibit cognitive-enhancing abilities and reduce the risk of dementia, especially of Alzheimer's type. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is triggered by the disruption of calcium homeostasis, which underlies the observed progressive cognitive decline that occurs in this neurodegenerative disorder. Fortunately, CCB is expected to offer neuroprotection and additionally demonstrate antiamyloid, antitau, antiphospholipase, antiplatelet, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activity, a solitary solution to all the subcellular physiological complications that are observed in AD. Therefore, the aim of this review was to unearth the prospective of CCB against cognitive frailty with a sole purpose of elucidating CCB as cognitive enhancers, which could find its use as a drug in prevention or treatment of AD. 
24503619	Subregional basal forebrain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease: a multicenter study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Histopathological studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest severe and region-specific neurodegeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS). Here, we studied the between-center reliability and diagnostic accuracy of MRI-based BFCS volumetry in a large multicenter data set, including participants with prodromal (n = 41) or clinically manifest AD (n = 134) and 148 cognitively healthy controls. Atrophy was determined using voxel-based and region-of-interest based analyses of high-dimensionally normalized MRI scans using a newly created map of the BFCS based on postmortem in cranio MRI and histology. The AD group showed significant volume reductions of all subregions of the BFCS, which were most pronounced in the posterior nucleus basalis Meynert (NbM). The mild cognitive impairment-AD group showed pronounced volume reductions in the posterior NbM, but preserved volumes of anterior-medial regions. Diagnostic accuracy of posterior NbM volume was superior to hippocampus volume in both groups, despite higher multicenter variability of the BFCS measurements. The data of our study suggest that BFCS morphometry may provide an emerging biomarker in AD.  
24918636	Metabolomics of human brain aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Jul
Neurons in the mature human central nervous system (CNS) perform a wide range of motor, sensory, regulatory, behavioral, and cognitive functions. Such diverse functional output requires a great diversity of CNS neuronal and non-neuronal populations. Metabolomics encompasses the study of the complete set of metabolites/low-molecular-weight intermediates (metabolome), which are context-dependent and vary according to the physiology, developmental state, or pathologic state of the cell, tissue, organ, or organism. Therefore, the use of metabolomics can help to unravel the diversity-and to disclose the specificity-of metabolic traits and their alterations in the brain and in fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, thus helping to uncover potential biomarkers of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review the current applications of metabolomics in studies of CNS aging and certain age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neurometabolomics will increase knowledge of the physiologic and pathologic functions of neural cells and will place the concept of selective neuronal vulnerability in a metabolic context.  
24918639	mTOR Hyperactivation in down syndrome hippocampus appears early during development.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Jul
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a key developmental pathway involved in mechanisms underlying cellular aging and neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that its deregulation may occur during early brain development in patients with Down syndrome (DS). The expression patterns and cellular distribution of components of mTOR signaling (phosphorylated S6, phosphorylated S6 kinase, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1, and phosphorylated mTOR) were investigated in developing hippocampi from controls and patients with DS and from adults with DS and Alzheimer disease-associated pathology using immunocytochemistry. In control hippocampi, only phosphorylated S6 was detected prenatally (19-41 gestational weeks); it became undetectable 2 months postnatally. Increased expression of phosphorylated S6, phosphorylated S6 kinase, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1, and phosphorylated mTOR was observed in DS hippocampus compared with controls. Phosphorylated S6 and phosphorylated S6 kinase were detected prenatally and persisted throughout postnatal development. Prominent expression of mTOR components was observed in pyramidal neurons with granulovacuolar degeneration and in neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampi of DS subjects with Alzheimer disease pathology. These findings suggest that a dysregulated mTOR pathway may contribute to both early hippocampal developmental abnormalities and hippocampal functional impairment developing before neurodegeneration. Moreover, the expression patterns of mTOR components in adult DS hippocampus support its association with Alzheimer disease-related histopathologic changes.  
24955352	Clinical genetics of Alzheimer's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140513 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It is a complex disorder with environmental and genetic components. There are two major types of AD, early onset and the more common late onset. The genetics of early-onset AD are largely understood with mutations in three different genes leading to the disease. In contrast, while susceptibility loci and alleles associated with late-onset AD have been identified using genetic association studies, the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease are not fully understood. Here we review the known genetics of early- and late-onset AD, the clinical features of EOAD according to genotypes, and the clinical implications of the genetics of AD.  
24971348	Comparison of two analytical platforms for CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140529 2014
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are currently being assessed with two different assays. Our objective was to study if there is a correlation between values obtained by both techniques, to compare their validity and search for conversion factor between values obtained for every protein. We compared the performances of two commonly used platforms, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a multiplex (xMAP) technology for measurement of CSF AÎ² 1-42, total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau 181p) proteins, in 30 AD patients and 28 control subjects. The relations between the variables of both techniques were evaluated using the Spearman p correlation coefficient (Î± = 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve (AUC) analyses were calculated for the variables of both techniques. The two assays platforms yielded different absolute values for the various analytes, always higher in ELISA. We found some correction factor between values: 2,1- to 3-fold for AÎ² 1-42; 4,1- to 4,6-fold for T-tau; and 1,4- to 1,6-fold for P-tau 181p. In addition, those values were highly correlated (AÎ² 1-42: r = 0.70, P &lt; 0.01; T-tau: r = 0.90, P &lt; 0.01; P-tau 181p: r = 0.85, P &lt; 0.01) and the AUC for the variables showed very similar values. In conclusion, the results obtained with ELISA and xMAP platforms were highly correlated and its validity is very similar. Differences in absolute values point to the need for a clear description of the technique used. Moreover, we found some conversion factor between values of every protein that may be useful for transformation between both techniques. 
24968011	Prenatal sex hormone exposure and risk of Alzheimer disease: a pilot study using the 2D: 4D digit length ratio.
Cogn Behav Neurol  2014Jun
Our aim was to investigate an association between prenatal sex hormone exposure and dementia diagnosis. Some evidence indicates that relatively low testosterone levels are a risk factor for men to develop Alzheimer disease (AD). Most research has examined current rather than premorbid testosterone levels, and little research has addressed testosterone and AD in women. In 20 men and women diagnosed with AD and 20 controls, we estimated prenatal exposure to testosterone and estrogen using the ratio of the length of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D). We analyzed the data using a 2 (men versus women)Ã—2 (controls versus AD participants) analysis of variance. The men with AD had significantly higher 2D:4D ratios than the male controls, indicating lower levels of prenatal testosterone and higher levels of prenatal estrogen exposure. The women with AD had significantly lower 2D:4D ratios than the female controls, indicating higher levels of prenatal testosterone and lower levels of prenatal estrogen exposure. These findings suggest that lower levels of prenatal testosterone and higher levels of estrogen exposure are a risk factor for AD in men, and that higher levels of prenatal testosterone and lower levels of prenatal estrogen exposure are a risk factor for women. Risk for AD may be related to prenatal exposure to a sex hormone different from an individual's chromosomal sex. 
24637090	Psychotropic drugs in patients with Alzheimer's Disease: a longitudinal study by the Registry of Dementias of Girona (ReDeGi) in Catalonia, Spain.
J Am Med Dir Assoc 20140314 2014Jul
Psychotropic drugs are usually prescribed to deal with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, especially when nonpharmacologic approaches are not available or have limited efficacy. Poor outcomes and serious adverse events of the drugs used must be addressed, and risk-benefit ratios need to be considered. The aim of this longitudinal study was to describe the evolution of dispensation of psychotropic drugs in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to identify the associated demographic and clinical variables. Longitudinal study using 698 cases with AD included in the Registry of Dementias of Girona in 2007 and 2008 and followed up during 3 years. Drugs were categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to detect the variables associated with the use of antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anxiolytics, and hypnotics. Of the patients, 51.2% consumed antipsychotics at least once during the three years of the study, whereas 73.3% and 58.2% consumed SSRIs and anxiolytics, respectively; 32.8% used hypnotics. Antipsychotic use was associated with a diagnosis of AD with delusions) [odds ratio (OR) = 5.7] and with increased behavior disorders (OR = 1.2). Patients with AD with depressed mood were more likely to be treated with SSRIs (OR = 3.1), while being a woman was associated with increased dispensation of anxiolytics (OR = 1.9) and SSRIs (OR = 2.2). Consumption of psychotropic drugs by the patients with AD registered in the Registry of Dementias of Girona is very high. Despite all the described adverse effects and recommendations of caution in their use, antipsychotics still are extensively used. 
24921156	Dose-dependent inhibition of BACE-1 by the monoterpenoid 2,3,4,4-tetramethyl-5-methylenecyclopent-2-enone in cellular and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Nat. Prod. 20140612 2014Jun27
BACE-1 is an aspartic protease involved in the conversion of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) in vivo, which is one of the key steps in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. In a previous screening procedure for inhibitors of BACE-1 activity, the oil of Lavandula luisieri was identified as the most potent among several essential oils. The inhibitory effect of this essential oil on AÎ² production was also demonstrated in a cellular assay. The composition of the volatile oil and the isolation of the compound responsible for the inhibitory activity were also reported. The present work focused on the characterization of the inhibition of BACE-1 by this active compound, a monoterpene necrodane ketone, 2,3,4,4-tetramethyl-5-methylenecyclopent-2-enone (1), with assessment of its Ki value and the type of inhibition. The dose-related effects of the compound were also evaluated using two different cell lines, with determinations of the respective EC50 values. The entire oil and the 2,3,4,4-tetramethyl-5-methylenecyclopent-2-enone (1) were tested on a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The overall results showed that compound 1 displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of BACE-1 in cellular and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and is therefore capable of passing through cellular membranes and the blood-brain barrier.  
24983862	Investigation of the flexibility of protein kinases implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.
Molecules 20140630 2014
The pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have been linked to the activity of three particular kinases--Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3Î² (GSK3Î²), Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (CDK5) and Extracellular-signal Regulated Kinase 2 (ERK2). As a consequence, the design of selective, potent and drug-like inhibitors of these kinases is of particular interest. Structure-based design methods are well-established in the development of kinase inhibitors. However, progress in this field is limited by the difficulty in obtaining X-ray crystal structures suitable for drug design and by the inability of this method to resolve highly flexible regions of the protein that are crucial for ligand binding. To address this issue, we have undertaken a study of human protein kinases CDK5/p25, CDK5, ERK2 and GSK3Î² using both conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and the new Active Site Pressurisation (ASP) methodology, to look for kinase-specific patterns of flexibility that could be leveraged for the design of selective inhibitors. ASP was used to examine the intrinsic flexibility of the ATP-binding pocket for CDK5/p25, CDK5 and GSK3Î² where it is shown to be capable of inducing significant conformational changes when compared with X-ray crystal structures. The results from these experiments were used to quantify the dynamics of each protein, which supported the observations made from the conventional MD simulations. Additional information was also derived from the ASP simulations, including the shape of the ATP-binding site and the rigidity of the ATP-binding pocket. These observations may be exploited in the design of selective inhibitors of GSK3Î², CDK5 and ERK2. 
24991761	N-alkyl carbazole derivatives as new tools for Alzheimer's disease: preliminary studies.
Molecules 20140702 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting brain cells and is the most common form of "dementia", because of the cognitive detriment which takes place. Neuronal disruption represents its major feature, due to the cytosolic accumulation of amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) which leads to senile plaques formation and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Many studies have focused on the design and therapeutic use of new molecules able to inhibit AÎ² aggregation. In this context, we evaluated the ability of two recently synthesized series of N-alkyl carbazole derivatives to increase the AÎ² soluble forms, through molecular docking simulations and in vitro experiments. Our data evidenced that two carbazole derivatives, the most active, adopt distinct binding modes involving key residues for AÎ² fibrillization. They exhibit a good interfering activity on AÎ² aggregation in mouse (N2a) cells, stably expressing wild-type human amyloid precursor protein (APP) 695. These preliminary results are promising and we are confident that the N-alkyl carbazole derivatives may encourage next future studies needed for enlarging the knowledge about the AD disease approach.  
25057066	[Pathological study of cerebral amyloid angiopathy in rat models of Alzheimer's disease].
Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao  2014Jun
To examine cerebral pathologies in cerebral amyloid angiopathy in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Rat models of Alzheimer's disease was established by stereotactic AÎ²1-42 fiber injection in the bilateral hippocampus. The cognitive function of the rats was evaluated with water maze test. HE staining, Congo red staining and double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence were used to examine the dynamic distribution of AÎ² fiber deposit in the brain. The model rats showed significant differences from the control rats in the escape latency and the times of crossing platform in waster maze test. HE staining revealed a decreased number and degeneration of the granular cells with increased glial cells in the model rats. Congo Red staining showed that the AÎ² fiber was deposited gradually in the small vessels in the brain parenchyma to cause thickening, stenosis or occlusion of the small vessels. Immunofluorescence staining detected AÎ² fiber migration from the parenchyma to the walls of the small arteries in the rat models. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a major pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease. 
25080104	The TRiC/CCT Chaperone Is Implicated in Alzheimer's Disease Based on Patient GWAS and an RNAi Screen in AÎ²-Expressing Caenorhabditis elegans.
PLoS ONE 20140731 2014
The human AÎ² peptide causes progressive paralysis when expressed in the muscles of the nematode worm, C. elegans. We have exploited this model of AÎ² toxicity by carrying out an RNAi screen to identify genes whose reduced expression modifies the severity of this locomotor phenotype. Our initial finding was that none of the human orthologues of these worm genes is identical with the genome-wide significant GWAS genes reported to date (the "white zone"); moreover there was no identity between worm screen hits and the longer list of GWAS genes which included those with borderline levels of significance (the "grey zone"). This indicates that AÎ² toxicity should not be considered as equivalent to sporadic AD. To increase the sensitivity of our analysis, we then considered the physical interactors (+1 interactome) of the products of the genes in both the worm and the white+grey zone lists. When we consider these worm and GWAS gene lists we find that 4 of the 60 worm genes have a +1 interactome overlap that is larger than expected by chance. Two of these genes form a chaperonin complex, the third is closely associated with this complex and the fourth gene codes for actin, the major substrate of the same chaperonin.  
25080229	Widespread disruption of functional brain organization in early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140731 2014
Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients present a different clinical profile than late-onset AD patients. This can be partially explained by cortical atrophy, although brain organization might provide more insight. The aim of this study was to examine functional connectivity in early-onset and late-onset AD patients. Resting-state fMRI scans of 20 early-onset (&lt;65 years old), 28 late-onset (â‰¥65 years old) AD patients and 15 "young" (&lt;65 years old) and 31 "old" (â‰¥65 years old) age-matched controls were available. Resting-state network-masks were used to create subject-specific maps. Group differences were examined using a non-parametric permutation test, accounting for gray-matter. Performance on five cognitive domains were used in a correlation analysis with functional connectivity in AD patients. Functional connectivity was not different in any of the RSNs when comparing the two control groups (young vs. old controls), which implies that there is no general effect of aging on functional connectivity. Functional connectivity in early-onset AD was lower in all networks compared to age-matched controls, where late-onset AD showed lower functional connectivity in the default-mode network. Functional connectivity was lower in early-onset compared to late-onset AD in auditory-, sensory-motor, dorsal-visual systems and the default mode network. Across patients, an association of functional connectivity of the default mode network was found with visuoconstruction. Functional connectivity of the right dorsal visual system was associated with attention across patients. In late-onset AD patients alone, higher functional connectivity of the sensory-motor system was associated with poorer memory performance. Functional brain organization was more widely disrupted in early-onset AD when compared to late-onset AD. This could possibly explain different clinical profiles, although more research into the relationship of functional connectivity and cognitive performance is needed.  
24618911	Association Between Clinical Measures and Florbetapir F18 PET Neuroimaging in Mild or Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Dementia.
J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci  2014Jul1
Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging, with 20% or more of patients misdiagnosed, even by expert clinicians. The authors conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis comparing baseline neuropsychiatric and other clinical characteristics in 199 expert-diagnosed mild and moderate AD dementia patients participating in industry-sponsored clinical trials of an investigational therapy, where 18% lacked florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) evidence of AD neuropathology. Significant differences were found only for cognition and ApoE Îµ4 status, but the large degree of score overlap would preclude using these measures to predict AD misdiagnosis. This study highlights the value of amyloid PET when evaluating patients with seemingly typical AD.  
24893798	Effects of long-term treatment with quercetin on cognition and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurochem. Res. 20140604 2014Aug
Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as a prominent, early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, therapeutics targeted to improve mitochondrial function could be beneficial. Quercetin, a bioflavanoid, has been reported to have potent neuro-protective effects, but its preventive effects on AÎ²-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment have not been well characterised. Three-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to a vehicle group, two quercetin (either 20 or 40Â mgÂ kg(-1)Â day(-1)) groups, or an Aricept (2Â mgÂ kg(-1)Â day(-1)) group. After 16Â weeks of treatment, we observed beneficial effects of quercetin (40Â mgÂ kg(-1)Â day(-1)), including lessening learning and memory deficits, reducing scattered senile plaques, and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species and ATP levels in mitochondria isolated from the hippocampus compared to control. Furthermore, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity significantly increased in the quercetin-treated (40Â mgÂ kg(-1)Â day(-1)) group. These findings suggest that a reduction in plaque burden and mitochondrial dysfunction through the activation of AMPK may be one of the mechanisms by which quercetin improves cognitive functioning in the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mouse model of AD.  
25095818	Retinal manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurodegener Dis Manag  2014Jun
SUMMARYâ€‚ Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neurodegenerative condition and most common cause of dementia worldwide. Current criteria for its diagnosis and monitoring rely on subjective, expensive or invasive methods that lack sufficient sensitivity, such that a concrete diagnosis of AD can only be made postmortem. Given the structural similarities of the neuro-retina and central nervous system, researchers have shown many manifestations of AD to be detectible in the retinae of humans and transgenic models of AD. Due to the eye's unique optical properties allowing noninvasive in vivo imaging, the retina could provide a window for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD long before symptom manifestation.  
23910655	Expression of Ambra1 in mouse brain during physiological and Alzheimer type aging.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130802 2014Jan
Autophagy is a major protein degradation pathway, essential for stress-induced and constitutive protein turnover. In nervous tissue, autophagy is constitutively active and crucial to neuronal survival. The efficiency of the autophagic pathway reportedly undergoes age-related decline, and autophagy defects are observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Since Ambra1 plays a fundamental role in regulating the autophagic process in developing nervous tissue, we investigated the expression of this protein in mature mouse brain and during physiological and Alzheimer type aging. The present study accomplished the first complete map of Ambra1 protein distribution in the various brain areas, and highlights differential expression in neuronal/glial cell populations. Differences in Ambra1 content are possibly related to specific neuronal features and properties, particularly concerning susceptibility to neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the analysis of Ambra1 expression in physiological and pathological brain aging supports important, though conflicting, functions of autophagy in neurodegenerative processes. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches, based on autophagy modulation, should also take into account the age-dependent roles of this mechanism in establishing, promoting, or counteracting neurodegeneration.  
24345046	Resveratrol in peanuts.
Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr  2014
Peanuts are important dietary food source of resveratrol with potent antioxidant properties implicated in reducing risk of cancer, cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease, and delaying aging. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbene phytoalexin phenolic compound produced in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. This paper is a review of trans-resveratrol and related stilbenes from peanuts--their chemical structures, mechanisms for their biosynthesis, and concentrations in comparison with other major food sources. It will also discuss trans-resveratrol's absorption, bioavailability, and major health benefits; processes to enhance their biosynthesis in peanuts by biotic and abiotic stresses; process optimization for enhanced levels in peanuts and their potential food applications; and methods used for its extraction and analysis. 
24623176	Sex modifies the APOE-related risk of developing Alzheimer disease.
Ann. Neurol. 20140414 2014Apr
The APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Case-control studies suggest the APOE4 link to AD is stronger in women. We examined the APOE4-by-sex interaction in conversion risk (from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD or from MCI to AD) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for an APOE-by-sex interaction on conversion in controls (n = 5,496) and MCI patients (n = 2,588). The interaction was also tested in CSF biomarker levels of 980 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Among controls, male and female carriers were more likely to convert to MCI/AD, but the effect was stronger in women (HR = 1.81 for women; HR = 1.27 for men; interaction: p = 0.011). The interaction remained significant in a predefined subanalysis restricted to APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 genotypes. Among MCI patients, both male and female APOE4 carriers were more likely to convert to AD (HR = 2.16 for women; HR = 1.64 for men); the interaction was not significant (p = 0.14). In the subanalysis restricted to APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 genotypes, the interaction was significant (p = 0.02; HR = 2.17 for women; HR = 1.51 for men). The APOE4-by-sex interaction on biomarker levels was significant for MCI patients for total tau and the tau-to-AÎ² ratio (p = 0.009 and p = 0.02, respectively; more AD-like in women). APOE4 confers greater AD risk in women. Biomarker results suggest that increased APOE-related risk in women may be associated with tau pathology. These findings have important clinical implications and suggest novel research approaches into AD pathogenesis. 
24614902	Additional use of AÎ²â‚„â‚‚/AÎ²â‚„â‚€ ratio with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers P-tau and AÎ²â‚„â‚‚ increases the level of evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiological process in routine practice.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have recently been included in the criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since interpretation of CSF profile requires the combination of three parameters, biological data are not always conclusive and isolated elevation of phosphorylated tau (P-tau) or reduction of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)42 alone can be observed. In these cases, AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio could be more relevant than AÎ²42 absolute values by considering inter-individual variations in the total amyloid load. The objective of this study was to assess the use of AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio to improve the accuracy of biological conclusions in the diagnosis of patients with ambiguous CSF AÎ²42 or tau results. Among 386 lumbar punctures analyzed in the lab in 2 years, 122 showed ambiguous biological data that were completed by CSF AÎ²40 quantification and AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio calculation. A biological conclusion was then made using 0.05 as the AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio cut-off. Our results showed that one-third of the biological profiles of patients with atypical dementia were ambiguous. The addition of AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio increased the proportion of interpretable biological profiles from 69% to 87%, without changing the conclusion when usual biomarkers (AÎ²42 and P-tau) were concordant. Our results support the use of the AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio in addition to the usual CSF AD biomarkers for patients with ambiguous biological profiles. This method could be specifically directed to this population in order to improve the level of certainty for clinical routine practice. 
24614905	Differences in routine clinical practice between early and late onset Alzheimer's disease: data from the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem).
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Due to age of onset, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is divided into early onset (EOAD) or late onset (LOAD), but emerging data also suggests that the underlying pathology may be different. Whether differences in clinical care exist is less well investigated. To evaluate whether there are differences in demographics, diagnostic work-up, and pharmacological treatment between EOAD and LOAD. Data on patients with newly diagnosed EOAD (n = 453) and LOAD (n = 4599) was obtained from the Swedish dementia registry (SveDem). Logistic regression models were used to adjust the comparisons for the baseline confounders including gender, cognitive decline, and co-morbidity. The majority of EOAD and LOAD were in the mild stage of the disease when diagnosed. The majority of patients with EOAD went through an extended diagnostic work-up including more technical investigations as well as assessments by neuropsychologists and speech therapists than patients with LOAD. EOAD patients were treated with overall fewer medications but obtained treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors to a higher extent than those with LOAD, while there were no differences between the groups in antidepressant and antipsychotics use. There are differences between EOAD and LOAD in demographics, diagnostic work-up, and pharmacological treatment. Based on our findings, an extensive work-up should be recommended when EOAD is suspected. 
24614908	Hypertension and inflammation in Alzheimer's disease: close partners in disease development and progression!
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is by far the most common sporadic neurodegenerative disorder. Clinically it is associated with cognitive and other neuropsychological impairments, and neuropathologically it is distinguished by presence of amyloid-Î² plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Hypertension has been traditionally associated with the etiology of vascular dementia, however, vascular risk factors including hypertension are increasingly being implicated in AD. Likewise, the importance of neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis is also widely recognized. Data from animal and non-AD human studies suggest a close reciprocal relationship between hypertension and inflammatory systems. Much less is known on the potential pathological interaction between hypertension and inflammation in AD and its subsequent effects on amyloid and tau misfolding, aggregation, and propagation, events recognized as critical for the development and progression of AD. This review summarizes what is known about the mechanistic interactions between hypertension and inflammatory mediators and assesses their potential synergistic/additive role in AD genesis. Increasing our understanding of the pathological interactions between the recognized risk factors for AD is a worthwhile endeavor in a condition which currently has limited treatment options but an increasing number of potential preventative measures.  
24625793	Pyruvate carboxylase and pentose phosphate fluxes are reduced in AÎ²PP-PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: a Â¹Â³C NMR study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Although pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the major pathway of glucose metabolism and source for energy production, pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) account for a significant fraction of glucose oxidation in the mature central nervous system. Flux through the PDH pathway has been reported to be reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients as well as in animal models of AD. However, fluxes through the PPP and PC pathways have not been explored under conditions of AD. The present study investigates the fluxes of PC and PPP in a 20-month-old AÎ²PP-PS1 mouse model of AD using 13C NMR spectroscopy together with an infusion of [2-13C]glucose. Mice were also administered [1,6-13C2]glucose or [1-13C]glucose for 10 or 90 min, respectively, to investigate PDH flux. AÎ²PP-PS1 mice exhibit a significant reduction in the level of NAA and increase in level of myo-inositol. The flux through PDH was found to be significantly lower in the cerebral cortex (AÎ²PP-PS1 0.39 Â± 0.08; control 0.77 Â± 0.08 Î¼mol/g/min), hippocampus (AÎ²PP-PS1 0.31 Â± 0.04; control 0.64 Â± 0.12 Î¼mol/g/min), and striatum (AÎ²PP-PS1 0.34 Â± 0.06; control 0.56 Â± 0.03 Î¼mol/g/min) of AÎ²PP-PS1 as compared with control mice. The fluxes through PC (AÎ²PP-PS1 0.037 Â± 0.006, control 0.079 Â± 0.013 Î¼mol/g/min) and PPP (AÎ²PP-PS1 0.024 Â± 0.005; control 0.062 Â± 0.022 Î¼mol/g/min) were found to be significantly reduced in AÎ²PP-PS1 mice when compared with age-matched controls. The reduction in the fluxes of PC and PPP may lead to a weakened neural defense system of ammonia detoxification and antioxidant reserve in AÎ²PP-PS1 mice, which may be responsible for the compromised neuronal viability and functions in AD.  
24625795	Altered serum levels of adipokines and insulin in probable Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Cerebral hypometabolism of glucose, weight loss, and decreased food intake are characteristic features of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic study on the serum levels of adipokines and insulin, the major hormones regulating energy metabolism, food intake, and body weight, in sporadic AD is necessary. The present study compares the serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, and insulin, measured by commercially available immuno-assay kits, between controls and sporadic AD subjects. The results show a conspicuous decrease in the level of leptin, a dramatic rise in the level of adiponectin, and also a statistically significant increase in insulin level, in the blood of AD subjects, with respect to controls. The changes in the serum levels of adiponectin and insulin in AD are positively correlated with the severity of dementia. Likewise, the serum level of leptin in AD subjects is negatively correlated with the degree of dementia. The changes in the levels of adipokines and insulin have implications in the amyloid pathology, neurodegeneration, and hypometabolism of glucose existing in the AD brain.  
24643135	Retrospective study on the benefits of combined Memantine and cholinEsterase inhibitor treatMent in AGEd Patients affected with Alzheimer's Disease: the MEMAGE study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Combined therapy of memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be associated with higher benefits than either monotherapy. This retrospective multicentric study conducted in seven Italian Ambulatory Centers for Dementia assessed the efficacy and safety of memantine 20 mg/day administered for 6 months in addition to an AChEI in AD patients with worsened cognitive functions and behavioral disorders. A total number of 240 patients (61.7% of women, 38.3% men, mean age 77.9 Â± 7.32 years old) who had started treatment with the combination therapy were recruited. At baseline (T0), Month 3 (T1), and Month 6 (T2), cognitive functions were assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), functional dependence by activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL, behavioral disturbances by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and comorbidities by Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. Adverse events were reported during the study. MMSE total score significantly increased at Month 6 (p = 0.029 versus month 3) and IADL total score significantly decreased from baseline to endpoint (p = 0.033). There were no significant changes from baseline in mean ADL, despite significant improvements in NPI total score. The mean MMSE total score significantly increased with the combination donepezil + memantine compared to rivastigmine + memantine. The adverse events profile was in line with the expected range of the drugs studied and concomitant therapies. Overall, 17 patients discontinued treatment in the observation time. Combined treatment with memantine and AChEIs was effective in patients with AD, particularly in slowing cognitive impairment and preventing the onset of agitation and aggression in elderly AD patients. 
24643139	Chronic treatment with anesthetic propofol improves cognitive function and attenuates caspase activation in both aged and Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
There is a need to seek new treatment(s) for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent study showed that AD patients may have decreased levels of functional GABA receptors. Propofol, a commonly used anesthetic, is a GABA receptor agonist. We therefore set out to perform a proof of concept study to determine whether chronic treatment with propofol (50 mg/kg/week) can improve cognitive function in both aged wild-type (WT) and AD transgenic (Tg) mice. Propofol was administrated to the WT and AD Tg mice once a week for 8 or 12 weeks, respectively. Morris water maze was used to assess the cognitive function of the mice following the propofol treatment. Activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-8 was investigated using western blot analysis at the end of the propofol treatment. In the mechanistic studies, effects of propofol, amyloid-Î² protein (AÎ²), and GABA receptor antagonist flumazenil on caspase-3 activation and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore were assessed in H4 human neuroglioma and mouse neuroblastoma cells by western blot analysis and flow cytometry. Here we showed that the propofol treatment improved cognitive function and attenuated brain caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation in both aged WT and AD Tg mice. Propofol attenuated AÎ²-induced caspase-3 activation and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the cells, and flumazenil inhibited the propofol's effects. These results suggested that propofol might improve cognitive function via attenuating the AÎ²-induced mitochondria dysfunction and caspase activation, which explored the potential that anesthetic propofol could improve cognitive function in elderly and AD patients.  
24662100	Verbal repetition in primary progressive aphasia and Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
We aimed to explore the nature of verbal repetition deficits and infer the cognitive systems involved in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A total of 63 patients (13 semantic variant (sv-PPA), 17 nonfluent/agrammatic variant (nfv-PPA), 10 logopenic variant (lv-PPA), 23 AD) and 13 matched healthy controls completed a battery of tests that included naming, word comprehension, digit span, repetition of multisyllabic single words, monosyllabic word span presented under similar and dissimilar phonological conditions, and sentence repetition. All patient groups displayed some level of impairment, however, specific patterns emerged in each variant. Participants with sv-PPA were the least impaired, showing marginal difficulties exclusively for sentence repetition, whereas those with lv-PPA had the worst overall performance. Cases with nfv-PPA showed compromised repetition of multisyllabic and phonologically similar words. The deficit in cases with AD was confined to span tasks. These distinctive patterns of language impairments can assist in the differential diagnosis of PPA variants and point toward the vulnerability of specific cognitive systems in each syndrome.  
24662101	Robust gene dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease brains.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The brain transcriptome of Alzheimer's disease (AD) reflects the prevailing disease mechanism at the gene expression level. However, thousands of genes have been reported to be dysregulated in AD brains in existing studies, and the consistency or discrepancy among these studies has not been thoroughly examined. Toward this end, we conducted a comprehensive survey of the brain transcriptome datasets for AD and other neurological diseases. We first demonstrated that the frequency of observed dysregulation in AD was highly correlated with the reproducibility of the dysregulation. Based on this observation, we selected 100 genes with the highest frequency of dysregulation to illustrate the core perturbation in AD brains. The dysregulation of these genes was validated in several independent datasets for AD. We further identified 12 genes with strong correlation of gene expression with disease progression. The relevance of these genes to disease progression was also validated in an independent dataset. Interestingly, we found a transcriptional "cushion" for these 100 genes in the less vulnerable visual cortex region, which may be a critical component of the protection mechanism for less vulnerable brain regions. To facilitate the research in this field, we have provided the expression information of ~8000 relevant genes on a publicly accessible web server AlzBIG (http://alz.big.ac.cn).  
24662102	Efficacy and safety of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The role of currently available drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been controversial, with some national formularies restricting their use, and health economists questioning whether the small clinical effects are economically worthwhile. To estimate the efficacy and safety of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine for the treatment of AD. Double-blind, placebo-controlled, with random assignment to a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine trials were included into the pooled studies. Cognitive effects were significant for all drugs, ranging from a -1.29 points mean difference (95% CI -2.30 to -0.28) in the 20 mg daily memantine trials to -3.20 points (95% CI -3.28 to -3.12) in the 32 mg daily galantamine group. Only memantine had no effect on the Clinicians' Global Impression of Change scale. No behavioral benefits were observed, except for -2.72 (95% CI -4.92 to -0.52) in the 10 mg daily donepezil group and -1.72 (95% CI -3.12 to -0.33) for 24 mg daily galantamine trial. Only 5 mg daily donepezil had no effect on the function outcome. Compared with placebo, more dropouts and adverse events occurred with the cholinesterase inhibitors, but not with memantine. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are able to stabilize or slow decline in cognition, function, behavior, and global change. 
24662105	Post-translational modifications in Alzheimer's disease and the potential for new biomarkers.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The ability to detect and diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) early is an ever pressing issue, and the development of markers of disease progression that are able to distinguish AD patients from normal aging and patients with alternative forms of dementia, is at the center of the issue. Protein markers of disease, or biomarkers, can be used not only to monitor the progression of AD, but also allow identification of patients suitable for potential therapy, and the response to therapy to be monitored. Cerebrospinal fluid protein biomarkers are important in this early AD diagnosis, and three such biomarkers have been extensively studied and are reviewed here. In addition, post translational protein modifications of proteins important in AD pathology are also discussed. If additional biomarkers can be identified and thoroughly understood, potential therapeutic agents can be better designed, and the effects of therapeutic intervention on disease progression can be monitored.  
24748117	Is memantine + acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment superior to either therapy alone in Alzheimer's disease?
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Currently, there is no established standard treatment for this disease; therefore, the treatment of Alzheimer's disease will be a major challenge for physicians in the next decade in order to ameliorate quality of life of patients and reduce the costs for the communities.  
24957018	Cocoa extracts reduce oligomerization of amyloid-Î²: implications for cognitive improvement in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by pathological aggregates of amyloid peptide-Î² (AÎ²) and tau protein. Currently available therapies mediate AD symptoms without modifying disease progression. Polyphenol-rich diets are reported to reduce the risk for AD. In the present study, we investigated the AD disease-modifying effects of cocoa, a rich source of flavanols, which are a class of polyphenols. We hypothesized that cocoa extracts interfere with amyloid-Î² oligomerization to prevent synaptic deficits. We tested the effects of three different cocoa extracts, viz. Natural, Dutched, and Lavado extracts, on AÎ²42 and AÎ²40 oligomerization, using photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins technique. To assess the effects of cocoa extracts on synaptic function, we measured long term potentiation in mouse brain hippocampal slices exposed to oligomeric AÎ². Our results indicate that cocoa extracts are effective in preventing the oligomerization of AÎ², with Lavado extract being most effective. Lavado extract, but not Dutched extract, was effective in restoring the long term potentiation response reduced by oligomeric AÎ². Our findings indicate that cocoa extracts have multiple disease-modifying properties in AD and present a promising route of therapeutic and/or preventative initiatives. 
24959800	Neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease with a vascular component.
Ann Agric Environ Med  2014
Vascular changes are observed in most cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Observations of AD and vascular disease (VD) allow us to surmise that vascular changes may not only affect cognitive impairment in AD but may also have a negative influence on the neuropsychiatric symptoms which often occur in the course of the disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of vascular factors on the neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease. The study included 48 people with a preliminary diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease on the basis of NINCDS/ADRDA criteria. The evaluation of impairments in cognitive functioning was carried out by means of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - the cognitive part (ADAS - cog), whereas the behavioural and psychological symptoms were evaluated by means of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - the version adapted for residents of nursing homes for the elderly (Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home Version) (NPI - NH). The score on the Hachinski scale was the basis for dividing the study participants into two groups - those with a mild vascular component (0-1 points on the Hachinski scale) and those with a severe vascular component (2-4 points). The analyzed groups did not differ with respect to the intensity of cognitive impairments (ADAS-cog) or age of the participants. Scores obtained on the NPI - NH scale as well as some of its elements (depression/dysphoria and anxiety) had a discriminating value. Studies show that vascular factors are a serious risk factor for neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. Vascular factors in Alzheimer's Disease influence the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. In the course of angiogenic dementia a greater frequency in depressive disorders was shown. The most visible differences between individuals with a greater and lesser burden of vascular factors was in the realm of depressive and dysphoric disorders. 
24931033	Inflammation, defective insulin signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction as common molecular denominators connecting type 2 diabetes to Alzheimer disease.
Diabetes 20140615 2014Jul
A growing body of evidence supports an intriguing clinical/epidemiological connection between Alzheimer disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D patients have significantly increased risk of developing AD and vice versa. Recent studies have begun to reveal common pathogenic mechanisms shared by AD and metabolic disorders, notably obesity and T2D. In T2D and obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation is a key mechanism leading to peripheral insulin resistance, which progressively causes tissue deterioration and overall health decline. In the brain, proinflammatory signaling was recently found to mediate impaired neuronal insulin signaling, synapse deterioration, and memory loss. Here, we review evidence indicating that inflammation, insulin resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction are common features in AD and T2D. We further propose the hypothesis that dementia and its underlying neuronal dysfunction are exacerbated or driven by peripheral inflammation. Identification of central and peripheral inflammation as potential mediators of brain dysfunction in AD may lead to the development of effective treatments for this devastating disease.  
24931035	Repurposing diabetes drugs for brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer disease.
Diabetes 20140615 2014Jul
A growing body of clinical and epidemiological research suggests that two of the most common diseases of aging, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and Alzheimer disease (AD), are linked. The nature of the association is not known, but this observation has led to the notion that drugs developed for the treatment of T2DM may be beneficial in modifying the pathophysiology of AD and maintaining cognitive function. Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of T2DM have resulted in a growing number of therapies that are approved or in clinical development for this disease. This review summarizes the evidence that T2DM and AD are linked, with a focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms in common, and then assesses the various clinical-stage diabetes drugs for their potential activity in AD. At a time when existing therapies for AD offer only limited symptomatic benefit for some patients, additional clinical trials of diabetes drugs are needed to at least advance the care of T2DM patients at risk for or with comorbid AD and also to determine their value for AD in general.  
24676028	Decreased serum zinc is an effect of ageing and not Alzheimer's disease.
Metallomics  2014Jul
We examined the distribution of zinc in the periphery (erythrocytes and serum) in a large, well-characterised cohort, the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, in order to determine if there is systemic perturbation in zinc homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We observed an age dependent decrease in serum zinc of approximately 0.4% per year. When correcting for the age dependent decline in serum zinc no significant difference between healthy controls (HC), mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) or AD subjects was observed.  
24756858	Significant structural differences between transient amyloid-Î² oligomers and less-toxic fibrils in regions known to harbor familial Alzheimer's mutations.
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 20140423 2014Jul1
Small oligomers of the amyloidâ€…Î² (AÎ²) peptide, rather than the monomers or the fibrils, are suspected to initiate Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their low concentration and transient nature under physiological conditions have made structural investigations difficult. A method for addressing such problems has been developed by combining rapid fluorescence techniques with slower two-dimensional solid-state NMR methods. The smallest AÎ²40 oligomers that demonstrate a potential sign of toxicity, namely, an enhanced affinity for cell membranes, were thus probed. The two hydrophobic regions (residues 10-21 and 30-40) have already attained the conformation that is observed in the fibrils. However, the turn region (residues 22-29) and the N-terminal tail (residues 1-9) are strikingly different. Notably, ten of eleven known AÎ²â€…mutants that are linked to familial AD map to these two regions. Our results provide potential structural cues for AD therapeutics and also suggest a general method for determining transient protein structures.  
24967370	Computational design of apolipoprotein E4 inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease therapy from traditional Chinese medicine.
Biomed Res Int 20140521 2014
Apolipoprotein E4 (Apo E4) is the major genetic risk factor in the causation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we utilize virtual screening of the world's largest traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database and investigate potential compounds for the inhibition of ApoE4. We present the top three TCM candidates: Solapalmitine, Isodesacetyluvaricin, and Budmunchiamine L5 for further investigation. Dynamics analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were used to simulate protein-ligand complexes for observing the interactions and protein variations. Budmunchiamine L5 did not have the highest score from virtual screening; however, the dynamics pose is similar to the initial docking pose after MD simulation. Trajectory analysis reveals that Budmunchiamine L5 was stable over all simulation times. The migration distance of Budmunchiamine L5 illustrates that docked ligands are not variable from the initial docked site. Interestingly, Arg158 was observed to form H-bonds with Budmunchiamine L5 in the docking pose and MD snapshot, which indicates that the TCM compounds could stably bind to ApoE4. Our results show that Budmunchiamine L5 has good absorption, blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and less toxicity according to absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction and could, therefore, be safely used for developing novel ApoE4 inhibitors.  
24964199	Amyloid beta-mediated epigenetic alteration of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 controls cell survival in Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140625 2014
Swedish double mutation (KM670/671NL) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is reported to increase toxic amyloid Î² (AÎ²) production via aberrant cleavage at the Î²-secretase site and thereby cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to AD pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Previously, our transcriptome sequence analyses revealed global expressional modifications of over 600 genes in APP-Swedish mutant-expressing H4 (H4-sw) cells compared to wild type H4 cells. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) is one gene that showed significantly decreased mRNA expression in H4-sw cells. In this study, we investigated the functional role of IGFBP3 in AD pathogenesis and elucidated the mechanisms regulating its expression. We observed decreased IGFBP3 expression in the H4-sw cell line as well as the hippocampus of AD model transgenic mice. Treatment with exogenous IGFBP3 protein inhibited AÎ²1-42- induced cell death and caspase-3 activity, whereas siRNA-mediated suppression of IGFBP3 expression induced cell death and caspase-3 cleavage. In primary hippocampal neurons, administration of IGFBP3 protein blocked apoptotic cell death due to AÎ²1-42 toxicity. These data implicate a protective role for IGFBP3 against AÎ²1-42-mediated apoptosis. Next, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of IGFBP3 expression in AD pathogenesis. We observed abnormal IGFBP3 hypermethylation within the promoter CpG island in H4-sw cells. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored IGFBP3 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Chronic exposure to AÎ²1-42 induced IGFBP3 hypermethylation at CpGs, particularly at loci -164 and -173, and subsequently suppressed IGFBP3 expression. Therefore, we demonstrate that expression of anti-apoptotic IGFBP3 is regulated by epigenetic DNA methylation, suggesting a mechanism that contributes to AD pathogenesis.  
25076894	Estrogen intake and copper depositions: implications for Alzheimer's disease?
Case Rep Neurol 20140619 2014May
We present a patient with chronic postmenopausal estrogen intake with presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea and Alzheimer's disease and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms of estrogen intake and copper accumulation in various tissues, including the central nervous system. Sonography was compatible with copper accumulation in the basal ganglia, but the patient showed no clinical signs of Wilson's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography revealed a typical pattern for Alzheimer's disease. We propose increased copper levels as a direct effect of estrogen intake due to an augmented ATP7A-mRNA in the intestine. Moreover, we discuss the impact of elevated free serum copper on accompanying Alzheimer's disease, knowing that copper plays a crucial role in the formation of amyloid plaques and tau aggregation. This might offer a partial explanation for the observation that postmenopausal estrogen therapy is associated with a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.  
25076902	Metal and complementary molecular bioimaging in Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140715 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting over 27 million people worldwide. AD represents a complex neurological disorder which is best understood as the consequence of a number of interconnected genetic and lifestyle variables, which culminate in multiple changes to brain structure and function. These can be observed on a gross anatomical level in brain atrophy, microscopically in extracellular amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, and at a functional level as alterations of metabolic activity. At a molecular level, metal dyshomeostasis is frequently observed in AD due to anomalous binding of metals such as Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (Zn), or impaired regulation of redox-active metals which can induce the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and neuronal damage. Metal chelators have been administered therapeutically in transgenic mice models for AD and in clinical human AD studies, with positive outcomes. As a result, neuroimaging of metals in a variety of intact brain cells and tissues is emerging as an important tool for increasing our understanding of the role of metal dysregulation in AD. Several imaging techniques have been used to study the cerebral metallo-architecture in biological specimens to obtain spatially resolved data on chemical elements present in a sample. Hyperspectral techniques, such as particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) can reveal relative intensities and even semi-quantitative concentrations of a large set of elements with differing spatial resolution and detection sensitivities. Other mass spectrometric and spectroscopy imaging techniques such as laser ablation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LA ESI-MS), MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to correlate changes in elemental distribution with the underlying pathology in AD brain specimens. Taken together, these techniques provide new techniques to probe the pathobiology of AD and pave the way for identifying new therapeutic targets. The current review aims to discuss the advantages and challenges of using these emerging elemental and molecular imaging techniques, and highlight clinical achievements in AD research using bioimaging techniques.  
25076901	Effects of caprylic triglyceride on cognitive performance and cerebral glucose metabolism in mild Alzheimer's disease: a single-case observation.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140716 2014
To examine the effect of 109â€‰days of caprylic triglyceride (CT) in a 70-year-old male with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral metabolism is limited to glucose under most conditions, and diminished cerebral glucose metabolism is a characteristic feature of AD. Another substrate available for cerebral metabolism is ketone bodies. Ketone bodies (KB) are normally derived from fat stores under conditions of low glucose availability as an alternative energy substrate to glucose. KB can also be produced by oral administration of CT. Prior studies suggest that the alternative energy source of CT may improve cognitive function due to mild to moderate AD, by circumventing the diminished glucose metabolism. The effect of CT was analyzed in a single-case of mild AD with cognitive alterations in an open label study. Study outcomes included the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), mini mental state exam (MMSE), and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scans. After 109â€‰days of CT, MoCA scores changed from a baseline value of 24-28, and MMSE scores changed from 23 to 28. No changes were observed on FDG PET scans. The results suggest that, in a case of mild AD, CT may have affected cognitive function, assessed by means of MMSE and MoCA, although glucose uptake and metabolism remained unchanged. 
24887203	Early alterations in energy metabolism in the hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20140602 2014Sep
The present study had focused on the behavioral phenotype and gene expression profile of molecules related to insulin receptor signaling in the hippocampus of 3 and 6month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated levels of the insoluble AÎ² (1-42) were detected in the brain extracts of the transgenic animals as early as 3months of age, prior to the AÎ² plaque formation (pre-plaque stage). By the early plaque stage (6months) both the soluble and insoluble AÎ² (1-40) and AÎ² (1-42) peptides were detectable. We studied the expression of genes related to memory function (Arc, Fos), insulin signaling, including insulin receptor (Insr), Irs1 and Irs2, as well as genes involved in insulin growth factor pathways, such as Igf1, Igf2, Igfr and Igfbp2. We also examined the expression and protein levels of key molecules related to energy metabolism (PGC1-Î±, and AMPK) and mitochondrial functionality (OXPHOS, TFAM, NRF1 and NRF2). 6month-old APP/PS1 mice demonstrated impaired cognitive ability, were glucose intolerant and showed a significant reduction in hippocampal Insr and Irs2 transcripts. Further observations also suggest alterations in key cellular energy sensors that regulate the activities of a number of metabolic enzymes through phosphorylation, such as a decrease in the Prkaa2 mRNA levels and in the pAMPK (Thr172)/Total APMK ratio. Moreover, mRNA and protein analysis reveals a significant downregulation of genes essential for mitochondrial replication and respiratory function, including PGC-1Î± in hippocampal extracts of APP/PS1 mice, compared to age-matched wild-type controls at 3 and 6months of age. Overall, the findings of this study show early alterations in genes involved in insulin and energy metabolism pathways in an APP/PS1 model of AD. These changes affect the activity of key molecules like NRF1 and PGC-1Î±, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the impairments in both insulin signaling and energy metabolism precede the development of AD amyloidogenesis.  
25091487	The role of ubiquitin-proteasome in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP): implications for novel therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.
Discov Med  2014 Jul-Aug
The proteasome serves as a major protein quality control system inside the cell. Dysfunction of this system has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Amyloid Î² accumulation is considered as the central molecular event in the development of AD. This accumulation can result from dysregulated proteolysis of its precursor, APP. Here, we will review the evidence that links proteasome dysfunction to altered APP metabolism, and summarize recent progress in identifying the regulators of APP ubiquitination. Pinpointing UPS components that are APP-specific could lead new pharmaceutical strategies to combat AD.  
24028075	Comparing atomistic molecular mechanics force fields for a difficult target: a case study on the Alzheimer's amyloid Î²-peptide.
J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 20130913 2014Nov
Macromolecular function arises from structure, and many diseases are associated with misfolding of proteins. Molecular simulation methods can augment experimental techniques to understand misfolding and aggregation pathways with atomistic resolution, but the reliability of these predictions is a function of the parameters used for the simulation. There are many biomolecular force fields available, but most are validated using stably folded structures. Here, we present the results of molecular dynamics simulations on the intrinsically disordered amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²), whose misfolding and aggregation give rise to the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Because of the link between secondary structure changes and pathology, being able to accurately model the structure of AÎ² would greatly improve our understanding of this disease, and it may facilitate application of modeling approaches to other protein misfolding disorders. To this end, we compared five popular atomistic force fields (AMBER03, CHARMM22 + CMAP, GROMOS96 53A6, GROMOS96 54A7, and OPLS-AA) to determine which could best model the structure of AÎ². By comparing secondary structure content, NMR shifts, and radius of gyration to available experimental data, we conclude that AMBER03 and CHARMM22 + CMAP over-stabilize helical structure within AÎ², with CHARMM22 + CMAP also producing elongated AÎ² structures, in conflict with experimental findings. OPLS-AA, GROMOS96 53A6, and GROMOS96 54A7 produce very similar results in terms of helical and Î²-strand content, calculated NMR shifts, and radii of gyration that agree well with experimental data.  
24500883	Stem-cell challenges in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a long way from bench to bedside.
Med Res Rev 20140205 2014Sep
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, and its neuropathology is characterized by deposition of insoluble Î²-amyloid peptides, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and the loss of diverse neurons. Current pharmacological treatments for AD relieve symptoms without affecting the major pathological characteristics of the disease. Therefore, it is essential to develop new and effective therapies. Stem-cell types include tissue-specific stem cells, such as neural stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells derived from blastocysts, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) reprogrammed from somatic cells. Recent preclinical evidence suggests that stem cells can be used to treat or model AD. The mechanisms of stem cell based therapies for AD include stem cell mediated neuroprotection and trophic actions, antiamyloidogenesis, beneficial immune modulation, and the replacement of the lost neurons. iPSCs have been recently used to model AD, investigate sporadic and familial AD pathogenesis, and screen for anti-AD drugs. Although considerable progress has been achieved, a series of challenges must be overcome before stem cell based cell therapies are used clinically for AD patients. This review highlights the recent experimental and preclinical progress of stem-cell therapies for AD, and discusses the translational challenges of their clinical application.  
24991033	Visuoperception test predicts pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in corticobasal syndrome.
Neurology 20140702 2014Aug5
To use the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP) to distinguish Alzheimer disease (AD) from non-AD pathology in corticobasal syndrome (CBS). This clinicopathologic study assessed 36 patients with CBS on the VOSP. All were autopsied. The primary dependent variable was a binary pathologic outcome: patients with CBS who had primary pathologic diagnosis of AD (CBS-AD, n = 10) vs patients with CBS without primary pathologic diagnosis of AD (CBS-nonAD, n = 26). We also determined sensitivity and specificity of individual VOSP subtests. Patients with CBS-AD had younger onset (54.5 vs 63.6 years, p = 0.001) and lower memory scores on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (16 vs 22 points, p = 0.003). Failure on the VOSP subtests Incomplete Letters (odds ratio [OR] 11.5, p = 0.006), Position Discrimination (OR 10.86, p = 0.008), Number Location (OR 12.27, p = 0.026), and Cube Analysis (OR 45.71 p = 0.0001) had significantly greater odds of CBS-AD than CBS-nonAD. These associations remained when adjusting for total Mattis Dementia Rating score, disease laterality, education, age, and sex. Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated significant accuracy for Incomplete Letters and all VOSP spatial subtests, with Cube Analysis performing best (area under the curve 0.91, p = 0.0004). In patients with CBS, failure on specific VOSP subtests is associated with greater odds of having underlying AD. There may be preferential involvement of the dorsal stream in CBS-AD. This study provides Class II evidence that some subtests of the VOSP accurately distinguish patients with CBS-AD from those without AD pathology (e.g., Cube Analysis sensitivity 100%, specificity 77%). 
25035300	Lewy body compared with Alzheimer dementia is associated with decreased functional connectivity in resting state networks.
Psychiatry Res 20140627 2014Sep30
Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure whole brain functional connectivity within specific networks hypothesised to be more affected in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (a disease characterised by prominent attentional deficits, spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism and depression) than in Alzheimer×³s disease (AD) and controls. This study involved 68 subjects (15 DLB, 13 AD and 40 controls) who were scanned using resting state BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) fMRI on a 3T MRI scanner. Functional connectivity was measured using a model-free independent component analysis approach that consisted of temporally concatenating the resting state fMRI data of all study subjects and investigating group differences using a back-reconstruction procedure. Resting state functional connectivity was affected in the default mode, salience, executive and basal ganglia networks in DLB subjects compared with AD and controls. Functional connectivity was lower in DLB compared with AD and controls in these networks, except for the basal ganglia network, where connectivity was greater in DLB. No resting state networks showed less connectivity in AD compared with DLB or controls. Our results suggest that functional connectivity of resting state networks can identify differences between DLB and AD subjects that may help to explain why DLB subjects have more frequent attentional deficits, parkinsonian symptoms, and depression than those with AD.  
24297060	Antibody-based magnetic nanoparticle immunoassay for quantification of Alzheimer's disease pathogenic factor.
J Biomed Opt  2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to a decline in cognitive and intellectual abilities and an irreversible mental deterioration. Based on multidisciplinary AD research, the most universally accepted hypotheses on AD pathogenesis are the intracerebral aggregate formation of beta-amyloid (AÎ²) peptides. According to medical paradigmatic transition from medical treatment to early diagnostic prevention, scientists have considered physiological body fluid as a biomarker medium, in which the promising AD biomarkers could be verified. Recently, use of saliva has been considered as one of the diagnostic fluids over the past decade with meaningful diagnostic potential. We utilized saliva as a biomarker medium to correlate the salivary AÎ² levels to AD pathological aspects, especially to the mild cognitive impairment group among AD patients, and to verify our detecting system to be sensitive enough for an early diagnostic tool. The identification of the salivary AD biomarkers using a facile microarraying method would motivate this study with the assistance of magnetically assembled antibody-conjugated nanoparticles and a photomultiplier tube as an optical detector. This simple magnetoimmunoassay system measures the photointensity generated by fluorescence, enables the quantification of the AÎ² peptides from AD salivary samples, and consequently classifies the salivary AÎ² levels into AD pathological aspects. This method demonstrates a facile approach enabling it to simply detect salivary AÎ² peptides at a concentration as low as ~20â€‰â€‰pg/ml. It is expected that our simple magnetoimmunoassay system may have a potential as a detector for low-level AÎ² peptides with weak-fluorescence emission. 
24297061	In vivo imaging of human adipose-derived stem cells in Alzheimer's disease animal model.
J Biomed Opt  2014May
Stem cell therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of diverse conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). To understand transplanted stem cell biology, in vivo imaging is necessary. Nanomaterial has great potential for in vivo imaging and several noninvasive methods are used, such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, fluorescence imaging (FI) and near-infrared FI. However, each method has limitations for in vivo imaging. To overcome these limitations, multimodal nanoprobes have been developed. In the present study, we intravenously injected human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) that were labeled with a multimodal nanoparticle, LEO-LIVEâ„¢-Magnoxide 675 or 797 (BITERIALS, Seoul, Korea), into Tg2576 mice, an AD mouse model. After sequential in vivo tracking using Maestro Imaging System, we found fluorescence signals up to 10 days after injection. We also found strong signals in the brains extracted from hASC-transplanted Tg2576 mice up to 12 days after injection. With these results, we suggest that in vivo imaging with this multimodal nanoparticle may provide a useful tool for stem cell tracking and understanding stem cell biology in other neurodegenerative diseases. 
23962722	Acetylation of the KXGS motifs in tau is a critical determinant in modulation of tau aggregation and clearance.
Hum. Mol. Genet. 20130819 2014Jan1
The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is a neuropathological hallmark of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, but effective therapies directly targeting the tau protein are currently lacking. Herein, we describe a novel mechanism in which the acetylation of tau on KXGS motifs inhibits phosphorylation on this same motif, and also prevents tau aggregation. Using a site-specific antibody to detect acetylation of KXGS motifs, we demonstrate that these sites are hypoacetylated in patients with AD, as well as a mouse model of tauopathy, suggesting that loss of acetylation on KXGS motifs renders tau vulnerable to pathogenic insults. Furthermore, we identify histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as the enzyme responsible for the deacetylation of these residues, and provide proof of concept that acute treatment with a selective and blood-brain barrier-permeable HDAC6 inhibitor enhances acetylation and decreases phosphorylation on tau's KXGS motifs in vivo. As such, we have uncovered a novel therapeutic pathway that can be manipulated to block the formation of pathogenic tau species in disease.  
24290657	Tau hyperphosphorylation: a downstream effector of isoflurane-induced neuroinflammation in aged rodents.
Med. Hypotheses 20131121 2014Jan
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a severe neurological sequela after anesthesia and surgery. Multiple risk factors, such as advanced age and anesthesia duration, relevant to POCD have been made out, although the pathophysiological mechanisms of this complication need to be further elucidated. To date, there is a substantial body of evidence implicating that neuroinflammatory cytokines and the subsequent neuroinflammatory response contribute to the cognitive impairment in aged rodents exposed to isoflurane, a commonly used general anesthetic. Interestingly, this cognitive disorder is mitigated by anti-inflammatory agents even 14 days after isoflurane exposure. In addition, isoflurane-induced upregulation of neuroinflammatory cytokines is only limited within 48 h. So a first possibility to consider is a downstream effector of isoflurane-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines which contributes to the long-lasting cognitive dysfunction. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) models, proinflammatory cytokines can induce tau hyperphosphorylation which is associated with synaptic abnormality and further cognitive impairment. It is unknown whether isoflurane-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines can trigger tau hyperphosphorylation. Taken together, we hypothesize that tau hyperphosphorylation is a downstream target of isoflurane-induced neuroinflammatory response and thus bridges the isoflurane-induced relatively transient neuroinflammatory process to the long-term cognitive impairment. 
24211686	Altered source-based EEG coherence of resting-state sensorimotor network in early-stage Alzheimer's disease compared to mild cognitive impairment.
Neurosci. Lett. 20131107 2014Jan13
Although the altered coherence between cortical areas in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been widely studied, it remains unclear whether the source-based coherence measures within sensorimotor network show significant difference between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. In the present study, resting-state electroencephalographic signals were recorded from 21 MCI and 21 mild AD patients. The spectral power and coherence in the sensorimotor areas were analyzed using the minimum norm estimate (MNE) combined with fast Fourier transform and coherence analysis in delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-25 Hz), and gamma (25-40 Hz) bands. Our results indicated that source-based coherence in AD showed increased delta coherences between the bilateral precentral, left supplementary motor area (SMA) and right precentral, and left SMA and right postcentral areas. However, no significant difference of spectral powers was observed between AD and MCI. To conclude, the phenotype conversion from MCI to AD may be associated with an altered connectivity of the sensorimotor cortical network. This is a promising finding; however, further large-scale studies are needed. 
24211693	Klotho in the cerebrospinal fluid of adults with and without Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci. Lett. 20131107 2014Jan13
The aging-suppressor gene klotho encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein that is predominantly secreted by the choroid plexus of the brain and in the kidney. Klotho-deficient mice develop multiple aging phenotypes, including impaired cognition. Klotho concentrations have not been described in the CSF of humans. We measured klotho in the CSF of 20 older adults with Alzheimer's disease and in 20 older and 20 younger adults with normal cognition. In 10 adults, aged 38-87 years, CSF klotho measurements were made at baseline and every 6h up to 18-30 h later. Mean (95% confidence interval [C.I.]) CSF klotho in men versus women were 899 (814, 983) and 716 (632, 801) pg/mL, respectively (P=0.002). Mean (95% C.I.) CSF klotho in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease were 664 (603, 725) and 776 (705, 828) pg/mL, respectively (P=0.02), adjusting for sex. Mean (95% C.I.) klotho in older versus younger adults were 766 (658, 874) and 992 (884, 1100) pg/mL, respectively (P=0.005), adjusting for sex. In the longitudinal study of CSF klotho, no significant circadian fluctuations were found in CSF klotho levels. This study suggests that CSF klotho concentrations are lower in females compared with males, in Alzheimer's disease, and in older versus younger adults. 
24534472	Regulation of protein conformation by Pin1 offers novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease.
Discov Med  2014Feb
Pin1 is a unique enzyme that changes the shape of target proteins by acting on specific amino acids that have been phosphorylated: serine or threonine residues that precede proline. Pin1 catalyzes the flip between two distinct orientations, called cis and trans, around the proline bond. This change in shape has profound effects on protein function and is a major signaling mechanism in the cell. Abnormal regulation of Pin1 has been associated with premature aging and multiple pathological processes, notably cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD), two major age-related diseases. In AD, Pin1 affects two proteins thought to be key to disease pathology: the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the microtubule-binding protein tau, by switching them from a dysfunctional shape (cis) back to a functional one (trans), which can be distinguished by cis and trans-specific antibodies. In the brains of people with AD, Pin1 is absent or inactivated and cis tau is accumulated at early stages of AD. In the absence of Pin1, APP is processed into toxic beta-amyloid and tau becomes misshapen to form tangles. As a result, Pin1-deficient mice develop age-dependent tau and AÎ² pathologies and neuronal degeneration and loss. Thus, regulation of protein conformation by Pin1 has a critical neuroprotective role and offers a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for AD. Notably, antibodies or vaccines specifically against the dysfunctional misshapen tau (while leaving the functional one untouched) may offer early diagnosis and treatment of AD and related disorders.  
24630364	High-fat diet-induced memory impairment in triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease (3xTgAD) mice isÂ independent of changes in amyloid and tau pathology.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140215 2014Aug
Obesity and consumption of a high-fat diet are known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diets high in fat also increase disease neuropathology and/or cognitive deficits in AD mouse models. However, the effect of a high-fat diet on both the neuropathology and memory impairments in the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTgAD) is unknown. Therefore, groups of 2-month-old male 3xTgAD and control (non-Tg) mice were maintained on a high-fat or control diet and memory was assessed at the age of 3-4, 7-8, 11-12, and 15-16Â months using a series of behavioral tests. A comparable increase in body weight was observed in non-Tg and 3xTgAD mice after high-fat feeding at all ages tested but a significantly greater increase in epididymal adipose tissue was observed in 3xTgAD mice at the age of 7-8, 11-12, and 15-16Â months. A high-fat diet caused memory impairments in non-Tg control mice as early as the age of 3-4Â months. In 3xTgAD mice, high-fat consumption led to a reduction in the age of onset and an increase in the extent of memory impairments. Some of these effects of high-fat diet on cognition in non-Tg and 3xTgAD mice were transient, and the age at which cognitive impairment was detected depended on the behavioral test. The effect of high-fat diet on memory in the 3xTgAD mice was independent of changes in AD neuropathology as no significant differences in (plaques, oligomers) or tau neuropathology were observed. An acute increase in microglial activation was seen in high-fat fed 3xTgAD mice at the age of 3-4Â months but in non-Tg control mice microglial activation was not observed until the age of 15-16Â months. These data indicate therefore that a high-fat diet has rapid and long-lasting negative effects on memory in both control and AD mice that are associated with neuroinflammation, but independent of changes in beta amyloid and tau neuropathology in the AD mice.  
24854788	The amyloid state and its association with protein misfolding diseases.
Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.  2014Jun
The phenomenon of protein aggregation and amyloid formation has become the subject of rapidly increasing research activities across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Such activities have been stimulated by the association of amyloid deposition with a range of debilitating medical disorders, from Alzheimer's disease to type II diabetes, many of which are major threats to human health and welfare in the modern world. It has become clear, however, that the ability to form the amyloid state is more general than previously imagined, and that its study can provide unique insights into the nature of the functional forms of peptides and proteins, as well as understanding the means by which protein homeostasis can be maintained and protein metastasis avoided.  
24920631	Chronic GluN2B antagonism disrupts behavior in wild-type mice without protecting against synapse loss or memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.

Extensive evidence implicates GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (GluN2B-NMDARs) in excitotoxic-insult-induced neurodegeneration and amyloid Î² (AÎ²)-induced synaptic dysfunction. Therefore, inhibiting GluN2B-NMDARs would appear to be a potential therapeutic strategy to provide neuroprotection and improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are no reports of long-term in vivo treatment of AD mouse models with GluN2B antagonists. We used piperidine18 (Pip18), a potent and selective GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, for long-term dosing in AD mouse models. Reduced freezing behavior in Tg2576 mice during fear conditioning was partially reversed after subchronic (17 d) Pip18 treatment. However, analysis of freezing behavior in different contexts indicated that this increased freezing likely involves elevated anxiety or excessive memory generalization in both nontransgenic (NTG) and Tg2576 mice. In PS2APP mice chronically fed with medicated food containing Pip18 for 4 months, spatial learning and memory deficits were not rescued, plaque-associated spine loss was not affected, and synaptic function was not altered. At the same time, altered open field activity consistent with increased anxiety and degraded performance in an active avoidance task were observed in NTG after chronic treatment. These results indicate that long-term treatment with a GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist does not provide a disease-modifying benefit and could cause cognitive liabilities rather than symptomatic benefit in AD mouse models. Therefore, these results challenge the expectation of the therapeutic potential for GluN2B-NMDAR antagonists in AD.  
24956173	Human cerebrospinal fluid fatty acid levels differ between supernatant fluid and brain-derived nanoparticle fractions, and are altered in Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140623 2014
Although saturated (SAFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids are important structural components of neuronal membranes and precursors of signaling molecules, knowledge of their metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is limited. Based on recent discovery that lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are distributed in both brain-derived nanoparticles (NP) and supernatant fluid (SF), we hypothesized that fatty acid (FA) abundance and distribution into these compartments is altered in early AD pathology. We assayed the FA composition and abundance in CSF fractions from cognitively healthy (CH), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD study participants using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In the SF fraction, concentration of docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, (C22:6n-3)] was less in AD compared with CH, while alpha linolenic acid [Î±-LNA, (C18:3n-3)] was lower in MCI compared with CH. In the NP fraction, levels of SAFAs (C15:0, C16:0) and a MUFA (C15:1) differentiated CH from MCI, while two MUFAs (C15:1, C19:1) and four PUFAs (C20:2n-6, C20:3n-3, C22:4n-6, C22:5n-3) were higher in AD compared with CH. Levels of even-chain free SAFA and total free FA levels were higher in AD, levels of odd-chain free SAFAs, MUFAs, n-3 PUFAs, and total PUFA, were lower in AD compared with CH. Free n-6 PUFA levels were similar in all three groups. FA metabolism is compartmentalized differently in NP versus SF fractions of CSF, and altered FA levels reflect the importance of abnormal metabolism and oxidative pathways in AD. Depleted DHA in CSF fractions in AD is consistent with the importance of n-3 PUFAs in cognitive function, and suggests that disturbed PUFA metabolism contributes to AD pathology. This study of FA levels in CSF fractions from different cognitive stages shows potential AD biomarkers, and provides further insight into cell membrane dysfunctions, including mechanisms leading to amyloid production. 
24813062	Enhancement of the nonamyloidogenic pathway by exogenous NGF in an Alzheimer transgenic mouse model.
Neuropeptides 20140422 2014Aug
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is an important nerve cell growth regulatory factor and has an indispensable role in the development, survival and regeneration of the cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons, and it has multiple targets when used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) therapy. In this study, we observed whether NGF can affect cholinergic neurons to change amyloid-Î² precursor protein (APP) metabolism process and reduce amyloidosis in AD brains. NGF was administered intranasally to APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice for 14weeks. We observed an increase in APP695 and ADAM10 and a decrease in BACE1 and PS1 protein levels and, subsequently, a reduction in AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 levels and AÎ² burden were present in NGF-treated mice brains, suggesting that NGF enhanced the APP nonamyloidogenic cleavage pathway and reduced the AÎ² generation in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice brains. 
24959687	Variability of CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: implications for clinical practice.
PLoS ONE 20140624 2014
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are increasingly being used for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the influence of CSF intralaboratory and interlaboratory variability on diagnostic CSF-based AD classification of subjects and identified causes of this variation. We measured CSF amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) 1-42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) by INNOTEST enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in a memory clinic population (nâ€Š=â€Š126). Samples were measured twice in a single or two laboratories that served as reference labs for CSF analyses in the Netherlands. Predefined cut-offs were used to classify CSF biomarkers as normal or abnormal/AD pattern. CSF intralaboratory variability was higher for AÎ²1-42 than for t-tau and p-tau. Reanalysis led to a change in biomarker classification (normal vs. abnormal) of 26% of the subjects based on AÎ²1-42, 10% based on t-tau, and 29% based on p-tau. The changes in absolute biomarker concentrations were paralleled by a similar change in levels of internal control samples between different assay lots. CSF interlaboratory variability was higher for p-tau than for AÎ²1-42 and t-tau, and reanalysis led to a change in biomarker classification of 12% of the subjects based on AÎ²1-42, 1% based on t-tau, and 22% based on p-tau. Intralaboratory and interlaboratory CSF variability frequently led to change in diagnostic CSF-based AD classification for AÎ²1-42 and p-tau. Lot-to-lot variation was a major cause of intralaboratory variability. This will have implications for the use of these biomarkers in clinical practice. 
25049450	Apathy and emotion-based decision-making in amnesic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Behav Neurol 20140622 2014
Apathy and reduced emotion-based decision-making are two behavioral modifications independently described in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The aims of this study were to investigate decision-making based on emotional feedback processing in AD and aMCI and to study the impact of reduced decision-making performances on apathy. We recruited 20 patients with AD, 20 participants with aMCI, and 20 healthy controls. All participants completed the Lille apathy rating scale (LARS) and the Iowa gambling task (IGT). Both aMCI and AD participants had reduced performances on the IGT and were more apathetic compared to controls without any difference between aMCI and AD groups. For the entire sample, LARS initiation dimension was related to IGT disadvantageous decision-making profile. We provide the first study showing that both aMCI and AD individuals make less profitable decisions than controls, whereas aMCI and AD did not differ. Disadvantageous decision-making profile on the IGT was associated with higher level of apathy on the action initiation dimension. The role of an abnormal IGT performance as a risk factor for the development of apathy needs to be investigated in other clinical populations and in normal aging. 
24967550	A gene-brain-cognition pathway for the effect of an Alzheimer×³s risk gene on working memory in young adults.
Neuropsychologia 20140623 2014Aug
Identifying pathways by which genetic Alzheimer×³s disease (AD) risk factors exert neurocognitive effects in young adults are essential for the effort to develop early interventions to forestall or prevent AD onset. Here, in a brain-imaging cohort of 59 young adults, we investigated effects of a variant within the clusterin (CLU) gene on working memory function and gray matter volume in cortical areas that support working memory. In addition, we investigated the extent to which effects of CLU genotype on working memory were independent of variation in the strongest AD risk factor gene apolipoprotein E (APOE). CLU is among the strongest genetic AD risk factors and, though it appears to share AD pathogenesis-related features with, APOE, it has been far less well studied. CLU genotype was associated with working memory performance in our study cohort. Notably, we found that variation in gray matter volume in a parietal region, previously implicated in maintenance of information for working memory, mediated the effect of CLU on working memory performance. APOE genotype did not affect working memory within our sample, and did not interact with CLU genotype. To our knowledge, this work represents the first evidence of a behavioral effect of CLU genotype in young people. In addition, this work identifies the first gene-brain-cognition mediation effect pathway for the transmission of the effect of an AD risk factor. Relative to conventional pairwise associations in cognitive neurogenetic research, gene-brain-cognition mediation modeling provides a more integrated understanding of how genetic effects transmit from gene to brain to cognitive function.  
24970754	Decreased platelet serotonin concentration in Alzheimer's disease with involuntary emotional expression disorder.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140623 2014Aug22
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder manifested by progressive decline in cognitive functions. A variety of behavioral disturbances appear very often in AD which might be associated with altered function of serotoninergic system. The aim of the study was to determine platelet serotonin (5-HT) concentrations in 49 patients with AD (NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV-TR criteria) subdivided in three groups: (a) patients with aggressive behavior, (b) patients with involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED) and (c) patients without aggression or IEED (controls). Platelet 5-HT concentrations were measured using ELISA. Platelet 5-HT concentrations were significantly lower in patients with AD and co-existing IEED compared to AD patients with aggressive behavior or control patients. No significant difference in platelet 5-HT concentrations was found between patients expressing aggressive behavior and controls. Our results suggest disruptions in serotoninergic system in AD patients with comorbid IEED but not with aggressive behavior and support the presumption that platelet 5-HT concentration is a suitable and easy measured peripheral indicator of some behavioral and psychological symptoms of AD.  
24996191	Altered effective connectivity patterns of the default mode network in Alzheimer's disease: An fMRI study.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140701 2014Aug22
The aim of this work is to investigate the differences of effective connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and normal controls (NC). The technique of independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to identify DMN components and multivariate Granger causality analysis (mGCA) was used to explore an effective connectivity pattern. We found that: (i) connections in AD were decreased than those in NC, in terms of intensity and quantity. Posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) exhibited significant activity in NC as it connected with most of the other regions within the DMN. Besides, the PCC was the convergence center which only received interactions from other regions; (ii) right inferior temporal cortex (rITC) in the NC exhibited stronger interactions with other regions within the DMN compared with AD patients; and (iii) interactions between medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral inferior parietal cortex (IPC) in the NC were weaker than those in AD patients. These findings may implicate a brain dysfunction in AD patients and reveal more pathophysiological characteristics of AD.  
24996192	Meta-analysis of the association between CR1 polymorphisms and risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140701 2014Aug22
CR1 polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) susceptibility. The findings of these studies, however, have been inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between CR1 variants and LOAD susceptibility. We retrieved all relevant studies of the associations between CR1 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to LOAD for the period up to March 30, 2014. The strength of the association between CR1 polymorphisms and LOAD risk was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 6 articles were eventually identified with 2752 LOAD cases and 2313 controls for the rs6656401 polymorphism, and 4 studies containing 2547 LOAD cases and 2338 controls were included for the rs3818361 polymorphism. Overall, the pooled data showed that the CR1 rs6656401 polymorphism was significantly associated with LOAD risk in the overall population (A vs. G: OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.17-1.50, P=0.000; AG+AA vs. GG: OR=1.39, 95%CI=1.20-1.61, P=0.000). With respect to the CR1 rs3818361 polymorphism, a statistically significant increased LOAD risk was observed in the overall population (T vs. C: OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.13-1.37, P=0.000; TT+TC vs. CC: OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.15-1.46, P=0.000; TT vs. TC+CC: OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.06-1.71, P=0.014). This meta-analysis demonstrated significant associations of both the CR1 rs6656401 and CR1 rs3818361 polymorphisms with LOAD susceptibility.  
24950120	MicroRNA-922 promotes tau phosphorylation by downregulating ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) expression in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroscience 20140617 2014Sep5
Decreased levels of soluble ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) have been reported in the brains of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and the introduction of UCHL1 rescued the synaptic and cognitive function of AD model mice. Obviously, a reduction in the levels of UCHL1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of UCHL1 levels in AD have not been fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been shown to participate in the process of AD. In our study, we discovered that microRNA-922 decreased the levels of UCHL1. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) mainly consisting of the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau are the defining pathological features of AD. In the present study, we found the levels of UCHL1 affected the levels of phosphorylated tau: the phosphorylated tau levels increased after knockdown of UCHL1 expression, and the phosphorylated tau levels decreased when UCHL1 was overexpressed. Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA-922 increased the phosphorylated tau levels. In conclusion, miR-922 increasing the levels of phosphorylated tau by regulating UCHL1 levels contributed to the pathogenesis of AD. Our study partly explained one of the mechanisms underlying the downregulation of UCHL1 levels in AD patients and could enrich the content of tau pathology in the pathogenesis of AD.  
24200528	Olfactory identification and cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
Chem. Senses 20131107 2014Jan
Olfactory impairment constitutes one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. We investigated which aspects of neuropsychological measures are correlated with olfactory identification performance among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Total of 220 participants with mild cognitive impairment (mean age 71.7 years) were examined. Odor identification was assessed using the Open Essence test. Participants underwent comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation, including measures of verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, attention/executive function, and processing speed. We examined associations between olfactory function and cognitive performance scores. Participants with severe hyposmia exhibited significantly poor verbal and visual memory performance, attention/executive function, and slower processing speed scores compared with those without severe hyposmia. In multivariable logistic regression models, better performance scores on verbal and visual memory were significantly associated with decreased likelihood of severe hyposmia after adjusting for age, sex, education, and other cognitive performance scores. These findings suggest that olfactory impairment might be more closely associated with memory loss compared with other aspects of cognitive functioning in mild cognitive impairment subjects.  
24644280	Molecular basis for increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer disease due to the naturally occurring L28P mutation in apolipoprotein E4.
J. Biol. Chem. 20140318 2014May2
The apolipoprotein (apo) E4 isoform has consistently emerged as a susceptibility factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), although the exact mechanism is not clear. A rare apoE4 mutant, apoE4[L28P] Pittsburgh, burdens carriers with an added risk for late-onset AD and may be a useful tool for gaining insights into the role of apoE4 in disease pathogenesis. Toward this end, we evaluated the effect of the L28P mutation on the structural and functional properties of apoE4. ApoE4[L28P] was found to have significantly perturbed thermodynamic properties, to have reduced helical content, and to expose a larger portion of the hydrophobic surface to the solvent. Furthermore, this mutant is thermodynamically destabilized and more prone to proteolysis. When interacting with lipids, apoE4[L28P] formed populations of lipoprotein particles with structural defects. The structural perturbations brought about by the mutation were accompanied by aberrant functions associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Specifically, apoE4[L28P] promoted the cellular uptake of extracellular amyloid Î² peptide 42 (AÎ²42) by human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells as well as by primary mouse neuronal cells and led to increased formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species that persisted for at least 24 h. Furthermore, lipoprotein particles containing apoE4[L28P] induced intracellular reactive oxygen species formation and reduced SK-N-SH cell viability. Overall, our findings suggest that the L28P mutation leads to significant structural and conformational perturbations in apoE4 and can induce functional defects associated with neuronal AÎ²42 accumulation and oxidative stress. We propose that these structural and functional changes underlie the observed added risk for AD development in carriers of apoE4[L28P].  
25001178	MicroRNA-125b induces tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
EMBO J. 20140707 2014Aug1
Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, but no clear disease-initiating mechanism is known. AÎ² deposits and neuronal tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau are characteristic for AD. Here, we analyze the contribution of microRNA-125b (miR-125b), which is elevated in AD. In primary neurons, overexpression of miR-125b causes tau hyperphosphorylation and an upregulation of p35, cdk5, and p44/42-MAPK signaling. In parallel, the phosphatases DUSP6 and PPP1CA and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-W are downregulated as direct targets of miR-125b. Knockdown of these phosphatases induces tau hyperphosphorylation, and overexpression of PPP1CA and Bcl-W prevents miR-125b-induced tau phosphorylation, suggesting that they mediate the effects of miR-125b on tau. Conversely, suppression of miR-125b in neurons by tough decoys reduces tau phosphorylation and kinase expression/activity. Injecting miR-125b into the hippocampus of mice impairs associative learning and is accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-W, DUSP6, and PPP1CA, resulting in increased tau phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, DUSP6 and PPP1CA are also reduced in AD brains. These data implicate miR-125b in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting pathological tau phosphorylation.  
24846203	Retinal alterations in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: an optical coherence tomography study.
J. Neurol. 20140521 2014Aug
Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) measured by means of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has been used as a marker not only of ophthalmologic diseases but also of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that patients with amnestic MCI show an intermediate RNFL thickness between normality and AD, and a macular volume and thickness as well. In a cross-sectional study we consecutively recruited 18 patients with AD, 21 with MCI, and 41 healthy controls. OCT was performed in all of them to measure circumpapillary RNFL thickness in Âµm, as well as macular volume and thickness. In the analysis of variance we saw that RNFL was thinner in MCI patients compared with controls, and it was also thinner in AD patients compared with MCI patients and controls. With regard to the macular measurements in mm(3), MCI patients had the greatest macular volume in comparison with AD patients and controls. In turn the controls had greater macular volume than AD patients. The decreased RNFL thickness in MCI and AD patients suggests loss of retinal neurons and their axons. The increased thickness and macular volume have never been reported before in aMCI. This finding could be explained by inflammation and/or gliosis in early stages of AD. OCT could be a useful marker of AD for early detection and monitoring progression.  
24764071	Relationships between balance and cognition in patients with subjective cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer disease.
Phys Ther 20140424 2014Aug
Balance impairments are common in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), but which aspects of balance are affected, at which stage of cognitive impairment, and their associations with cognitive domains remain unexplored. The aims of this study were: (1) to explore differences in balance abilities among patients with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild AD, and moderate AD and (2) to examine the relationship between the various aspects of balance and cognitive domains. This was a cross-sectional study. Home-dwelling patients with SCI or MCI (n=33), mild AD (n=99), and moderate AD (n=38) participated in this study. The Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest), comprising 6 subscales-"Biomechanical Constraints," "Stability Limits/Verticality," "Anticipatory Postural Adjustments," "Postural Responses," "Sensory Orientation," and "Stability in Gait"-was used to assess balance. Cognitive domains were assessed using the following measures: Mini-Mental Status Examination, Word-List Learning Test from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), Verbal Fluency Test, Clock Drawing Test, and Trail Making Test, parts A and B (TMT-A and TMT-B, respectively). Two-way between-group analyses of variance, adjusted for age, were used to analyze differences among the groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the associations between balance and cognition. Differences were found between the groups on all BESTest subscales; the moderate AD group had the worst scores. The TMT-B (measuring executive function) was associated with all of the BESTest subscales after controlling for demographic factors. The cross-sectional design hampered interpretation of the development of balance impairments. The study findings indicate that all aspects of balance control deteriorate with increasing severity of cognitive impairment and that executive function plays an important role in balance control. Physical therapists should pay attention to these findings both in clinical practice and in future research. 
23313563	Is there an association between peripheral immune markers and structural/functional neuroimaging findings?
Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry 20130111 2014Jan3
There is mounting evidence that inflammatory processes play a key role in emotional as well as cognitive dysfunctions. In this context, research employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MR spectroscopy) suggests a possible link between structural/functional anomalies in the brain and an increase of circulating inflammation markers. The present paper reviews this research, with particular focus on major depressive disorder (MDD), cognitive impairment in older adults, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. In MDD, cognitive impairment and AD, inflammatory processes have been found to be associated with both structural and functional anomalies, perhaps under the influence of environmental stress. Not enough research can suggest similar considerations in schizophrenia, although studies in mice and non-human primates support the belief that inflammatory responses generated during pregnancy can affect brain development and contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia. The present review suggests a link between inflammatory processes and MRI detected anomalies in the brain of individuals with MDD, older adults with cognitive impairment as well as of individuals with AD and schizophrenia. 
23891730	Reduced frequency of T lymphocytes expressing CTLA-4 in frontotemporal dementia compared to Alzheimer's disease.
Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry 20130725 2014Jan3
Studies suggest that inflammation is involved in the neurodegenerative cascade of dementias. Immunological mechanisms may be part of the pathophysiological process in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but up till now only vague evidence of such mechanisms has been presented. The B7- CD28/CTLA-4 pathway is an important immunological signaling pathway involved in modulation of T cell activation. The aim of this study was to compare the expression of molecules associated with co-stimulatory signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of FTD to Alzheimer disease (AD) and control groups. Our results confirm the previous demonstrated increased expression of CD80 in CD14+ Alzheimer patients T cells but show, for the first time, a reduction in the expression of CTLA-4 in CD4+ FTD cells. As CTLA-4 is the most potent negative regulators of T-cell activation we speculated that peripheral T lymphocytes in FTD are more activated and this could be involved in the neurodegeneration observed in this dementia.  
24603951	Acupuncture modulates resting state hippocampal functional connectivity in Alzheimer disease.
PLoS ONE 20140306 2014
Our objective is to clarify the effects of acupuncture on hippocampal connectivity in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-eight right-handed subjects (14 AD patients and 14 healthy elders) participated in this study. Clinical and neuropsychological examinations were performed on all subjects. MRI was performed using a SIEMENS verio 3-Tesla scanner. The fMRI study used a single block experimental design. We first acquired baseline resting state data during the initial 3 minutes and then performed acupuncture stimulation on the Tai chong and He gu acupoints for 3 minutes. Last, we acquired fMRI data for another 10 minutes after the needle was withdrawn. The preprocessing and data analysis were performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM5) software. Two-sample t-tests were performed using data from the two groups in different states. We found that during the resting state, several frontal and temporal regions showed decreased hippocampal connectivity in AD patients relative to control subjects. During the resting state following acupuncture, AD patients showed increased connectivity in most of these hippocampus related regions compared to the first resting state. In conclusion, we investigated the effect of acupuncture on AD patients by combing fMRI and traditional acupuncture. Our fMRI study confirmed that acupuncture at Tai chong and He gu can enhance the hippocampal connectivity in AD patients.  
24608847	A novel blood-brain barrier co-culture system for drug targeting of Alzheimer's disease: establishment by using acitretin as a model drug.
PLoS ONE 20140307 2014
In the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) the homeostasis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in the brain is impaired. The expression of the competing proteases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE-1 (beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1) is shifted in favor of the A-beta generating enzyme BACE-1. Acitretin--a synthetic retinoid-e.g., has been shown to increase ADAM10 gene expression, resulting in a decreased level of A-beta peptides within the brain of AD model mice and thus is of possible value for AD therapy. A striking challenge in evaluating novel therapeutically applicable drugs is the analysis of their potential to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for central nervous system targeting. In this study, we established a novel cell-based bio-assay model to test ADAM10-inducing drugs for their ability to cross the BBB. We therefore used primary porcine brain endothelial cells (PBECs) and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) transfected with an ADAM10-promoter luciferase reporter vector in an indirect co-culture system. Acitretin served as a model substance that crosses the BBB and induces ADAM10 expression. We ensured that ADAM10-dependent constitutive APP metabolism in the neuronal cells was unaffected under co-cultivation conditions. Barrier properties established by PBECs were augmented by co-cultivation with SH-SY5Y cells and they remained stable during the treatment with acitretin as demonstrated by electrical resistance measurement and permeability-coefficient determination. As a consequence of transcellular acitretin transport measured by HPLC, the activity of the ADAM10-promoter reporter gene was significantly increased in co-cultured neuronal cells as compared to vehicle-treated controls. In the present study, we provide a new bio-assay system relevant for the study of drug targeting of AD. This bio-assay can easily be adapted to analyze other Alzheimer- or CNS disease-relevant targets in neuronal cells, as their therapeutical potential also depends on the ability to penetrate the BBB. 
24833295	Liver X receptors in lipid metabolism: opportunities for drug discovery.
Nat Rev Drug Discov 20140516 2014Jun
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are pivotal regulators of lipid homeostasis in mammals. These transcription factors control the expression of a battery of genes involved in the uptake, transport, efflux and excretion of cholesterol in a tissue-dependent manner. The identification of the LXRs, and an increased understanding of the mechanisms by which LXR signalling regulates lipid homeostasis in different tissues (including the liver, intestine and brain), has highlighted new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in human metabolism. New strategies for the pharmacological manipulation of LXRs and their target genes offer promise for the treatment of human diseases in which lipids have a central role, including atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.  
24874321	[A role of glutamate decarboxylase in Alzheimer's disease].
Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova  2014
To evaluate the levels of the main GABA synthetic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase (represented by two isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67) in the cerebellum cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mentally healthy subjects. Samples of the cerebellum cortex from 13 mentally healthy subjects (the control group) and 13 patients with AD were studied. Samples obtained after autopsy were frozen and stored at -80 Â°C. The groups are matched by sex, age, postmortem interval and cause of death. Protein extracts from cerebellum tissues were obtained after removing of nuclei and cell debris by centrifugation and treatment of the obtained fractions with detergent (SDS). Relative amounts of GAD65 and GAD67 were determined using SDS-PAAG-electrophoresis with the following semi-quantitative ECL-Western-immunoblotting with chemiluminescence detection. The amounts of both isoenzymes (GAD65 and GAD67) were significantly reduced in AD samples. The decreased amount of both glutamate decarboxylase isoenzymes suggests the decreased synthesis of neurotransmitter and basic GABA pools that indicates insufficient functioning of the GABA system in the cerebellar cortex of AD patients. 
24954589	Role of zinc and copper ions in the pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Biochemistry Mosc.  2014May
Disbalance of zinc (Zn2+) and copper (Cu2+) ions in the central nervous system is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative disorders such as multisystem atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Wilson-Konovalov disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Among these, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most frequent age-related neurodegenerative pathologies with disorders in Zn2+ and Cu2+ homeostasis playing a pivotal role in the mechanisms of pathogenesis. In this review we generalized and systematized current literature data concerning this problem. The interactions of Zn2+ and Cu2+ with amyloid precursor protein (APP), Î²-amyloid (Abeta), tau-protein, metallothioneins, and GSK3Î² are considered, as well as the role of these interactions in the generation of free radicals in AD and PD. Analysis of the literature suggests that the main factors of AD and PD pathogenesis (oxidative stress, structural disorders and aggregation of proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction, energy deficiency) that initiate a cascade of events resulting finally in the dysfunction of neuronal networks are mediated by the disbalance of Zn2+ and Cu2+.  
24852829	The association of single nucleotide polymorphism of the Fyn gene with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in the Chinese Han population.

Recent studies suggested genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Fibroblast Yes related novel (Fyn), a tau kinase, has been reported to be associated with aberrant phosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles formation. Fyn gene may be a potential candidate gene for AD. To investigate the association of the polymorphisms in Fyn gene with the susceptibility to sAD, we conducted a case-control study in a Chinese Han cohort including 200 sAD patients and 243 control participants. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs111787668, rs1057979, rs6916861 and rs12910) within the promoter region of Fyn gene and one (rs7768046) in intron were selected and genotyped with a polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. Logistic regression under four genetic models was used to analyze the association between target SNPs and the risk of sAD. After adjusting for age, sex and APOE É›4 status, no association was revealed between these SNPs or the haplotypes containing four SNPs and the risk of sAD (P&gt;0.05). The SNPs in the selected regions of the Fyn gene are unlikely to confer the susceptibility of sAD in the Chinese Han population. Further studies with a larger sample size and different ethnic populations are needed to reveal the role of Fyn gene in the pathogenesis of sAD.  
24954834	Imaging discrepancies between magnetic resonance imaging and brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and verification with amyloid positron emission tomography.
Psychogeriatrics  2014Jun
In the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), discrepancies are often observed between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings. MRI, brain perfusion SPECT, and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) findings were compared in patients with mild cognitive impairment or early AD to clarify the discrepancies between imaging modalities. Several imaging markers were investigated, including the cortical average standardized uptake value ratio on amyloid PET, the Z-score of a voxel-based specific regional analysis system for AD on MRI, periventricular hyperintensity grade, deep white matter hyperintense signal grade, number of microbleeds, and three indicators of the easy Z-score imaging system for a specific SPECT volume-of-interest analysis. Based on the results of the regional analysis and the three indicators, we classified patients into four groups and then compared the results of amyloid PET, periventricular hyperintensity grade, deep white matter hyperintense signal grade, and the numbers of microbleeds among the groups. The amyloid deposition was the highest in the group that presented typical AD findings on both the regional analysis and the three indicators. The two groups that showed an imaging discrepancy between the regional analysis and the three indicators demonstrated intermediate amyloid deposition findings compared with the typical and atypical groups. The patients who showed hippocampal atrophy on the regional analysis and atypical AD findings using the three indicators were approximately 60% amyloid-negative. The mean periventricular hyperintensity grade was highest in the typical group. Patients showing discrepancies between MRI and SPECT demonstrated intermediate amyloid deposition findings compared with patients who showed typical or atypical findings. Strong white matter signal abnormalities on MRI in patients who presented typical AD findings provided further evidence for the involvement of vascular factors in AD. 
24881006	Persons with moderate Alzheimer's disease use simple technology aids to manage daily activities and leisure occupation.
Res Dev Disabil 20140528 2014Sep
Two studies assessed technology-aided programs to support performance of daily activities and selection/activation of music items with patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease. In Study I, four patients were presented with activity-related pictorial instructions via a computer fitted with inexpensive, commercial software. In Study II, four patients were (a) presented with different music options and (b) allowed to select and activate the preferred option via a microswitch response. Study I showed that each patient learned to perform the two activities available with percentages of correct responses exceeding 85 by the end of the intervention. Study II showed that all patients learned to choose and activate music options. Psychology students, employed in a social validation check, scored the patients' behavior within the program better than their behavior in a control situation. The relevance and usability of simplified pictorial-instruction programs and music choice programs for patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease were discussed.  
24655393	Relative importance of redox buffers GSH and NAD(P)H in age-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer disease-like mouse neurons.
Aging Cell 20140321 2014Aug
Aging, a major risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with an oxidative redox shift, decreased redox buffer protection, and increased free radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, probably linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. While NADH is the ultimate electron donor for many redox reactions, including oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione (GSH) is the major ROS detoxifying redox buffer in the cell. Here, we explored the relative importance of NADH and GSH to neurodegeneration in aging and AD neurons from nontransgenic and 3xTg-AD mice by inhibiting their synthesis to determine whether NADH can compensate for the GSH loss to maintain redox balance. Neurons stressed by either depleting NAD(P)H or GSH indicated that NADH redox control is upstream of GSH levels. Further, although depletion of NAD(P)H or GSH correlated linearly with neuron death, compared with GSH depletion, higher neurodegeneration was observed when NAD(P)H was extrapolated to zero, especially in old age, and in the 3xTg-AD neurons. We also observed an age-dependent loss of gene expression of key redox-dependent biosynthetic enzymes, NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), and NNT (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase). Moreover, age-related correlations between brain NNT or NAMPT gene expression and NADPH levels suggest that these genes contribute to the age-related declines in NAD(P)H. Our data indicate that in aging and more so in AD-like neurons, NAD(P)H redox control is upstream of GSH and an oxidative redox shift that promotes neurodegeneration. Thus, NAD(P)H generation may be a more efficacious therapeutic target upstream of GSH and ROS.  
25071554	Application of a MRI based index to longitudinal atrophy change in Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment and healthy older individuals in the AddNeuroMed cohort.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140714 2014
Cross sectional studies of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) have identified several brain regions known to be prone to degeneration suitable as biomarkers, including hippocampal, ventricular, and whole brain volume. The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate an index based on morphometric measures derived from MRI data that could be used for classification of AD and healthy control subjects, as well as prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Patients originated from the AddNeuroMed project at baseline (119 AD, 119 MCI, 110 controls (CTL)) and 1-year follow-up (62 AD, 73 MCI, 79 CTL). Data consisted of 3D T1-weighted MR images, demographics, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CERAD and CDR scores, and APOE e4 status. We computed an index using a multivariate classification model (AD vs. CTL), using orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS). Sensitivity, specificity and AUC were determined. Performance of the classifier (AD vs. CTL) was high at baseline (10-fold cross-validation, 84% sensitivity, 91% specificity, 0.93 AUC) and at 1-year follow-up (92% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 0.93 AUC). Predictions of conversion from MCI to AD were good at baseline (77% of MCI converters) and at follow-up (91% of MCI converters). MCI carriers of the APOE e4 allele manifested more atrophy and presented a faster cognitive decline when compared to non-carriers. The derived index demonstrated a steady increase in atrophy over time, yielding higher accuracy in prediction at the time of clinical conversion. Neuropsychological tests appeared less sensitive to changes over time. However, taking the average of the two time points yielded better correlation between the index and cognitive scores as opposed to using cross-sectional data only. Thus, multivariate classification seemed to detect patterns of AD changes before conversion from MCI to AD and including longitudinal information is of great importance.  
25071556	Intraindividual variability across cognitive tasks as a potential marker for prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140704 2014
Recent studies have shown that increased cognitive intraindividual variability (IIV) across accuracy scores from tests representing different cognitive domains (across-domain IIV) might indicate prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although IIV has been proposed to index cognitive control processes, IIV across accuracy scores from cognitive control tasks (within-domain IIV) has not been examined in healthy controls subjects (HCS), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients in a single comparative study. This study examines the discriminative properties of within-domain IIV, and across-domain IIV in 149 HCS, 31 MCI, and 26 AD. Three tasks representing different cognitive domains were identified to calculate across-domain IIV. Three other tasks representing cognitive control were identified to calculate within-domain IIV. The intraindividual standard deviation was calculated across accuracy scores. To compare IIV between groups, ANCOVAs with the covariates age, gender, education, and mean performance were computed. IIV scores in general were higher in AD vs. HCS (p &lt; 0.01). Only across-domain IIV was higher in AD vs. MCI (p = 0.001), and only within-domain IIV was higher in MCI vs. HCS (p = 0.05). Within-domain IIV may constitute a cognitive marker for the detection of prodromal AD at the MCI stage, whereas across-domain IIV may detect beginning AD at the MCI stage.  
25071725	Insulin as a Bridge between Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer Disease - How Anti-Diabetics Could be a Solution for Dementia.
Front Endocrinol (Lausanne) 20140708 2014
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are two major health issues nowadays. T2D is an ever increasing epidemic, affecting millions of elderly people worldwide, with major repercussions in the patients' daily life. This is mostly due to its chronic complications that may affect brain and constitutes a risk factor for AD. T2D principal hallmark is insulin resistance which also occurs in AD, rendering both pathologies more than mere unrelated diseases. This hypothesis has been reinforced in the recent years, with a high number of studies highlighting the existence of several common molecular links. As such, it is not surprising that AD has been considered as the "type 3 diabetes" or a "brain-specific T2D," supporting the idea that a beneficial therapeutic strategy against T2D might be also beneficial against AD. Herewith, we aim to review some of the recent developments on the common features between T2D and AD, namely on insulin signaling and its participation in the regulation of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation (the two major neuropathological hallmarks of AD). We also critically analyze the promising field that some anti-T2D drugs may protect against dementia and AD, with a special emphasis on the novel incretin/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.  
25071820	Using the zebrafish model for Alzheimer's disease research.
Front Genet 20140630 2014
Rodent models have been extensively used to investigate the cause and mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease. Despite many years of intensive research using these models we still lack a detailed understanding of the molecular events that lead to neurodegeneration. Although zebrafish lack the complexity of advanced cognitive behaviors evident in rodent models they have proven to be a very informative model for the study of human diseases. In this review we give an overview of how the zebrafish has been used to study Alzheimer's disease. Zebrafish possess genes orthologous to those mutated in familial Alzheimer's disease and research using zebrafish has revealed unique characteristics of these genes that have been difficult to observe in rodent models. The zebrafish is becoming an increasingly popular model for the investigation of Alzheimer's disease and will complement studies using other models to help complete our understanding of this disease.  
25071582	HFE gene variants, iron, and lipids: a novel connection in Alzheimer's disease.
Front Pharmacol 20140708 2014
Iron accumulation and associated oxidative stress in the brain have been consistently found in several neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple genetic studies have been undertaken to try to identify a cause of neurodegenerative diseases but direct connections have been rare. In the iron field, variants in the HFE gene that give rise to a protein involved in cellular iron regulation, are associated with iron accumulation in multiple organs including the brain. There is also substantial epidemiological, genetic, and molecular evidence of disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in several neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the efforts that have been made to identify factors that can trigger the pathological events associated with neurodegenerative diseases they remain mostly unknown. Because molecular phenotypes such as oxidative stress, synaptic failure, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline, characteristics associated with AD, have been shown to result from disruption of a number of pathways, one can easily argue that the phenotype seen may not arise from a linear sequence of events. Therefore, a multi-targeted approach is needed to understand a complex disorder like AD. This can be achieved only when knowledge about interactions between the different pathways and the potential influence of environmental factors on them becomes available. Toward this end, this review discusses what is known about the roles and interactions of iron and cholesterol in neurodegenerative diseases. It highlights the effects of gene variants of HFE (H63D- and C282Y-HFE) on iron and cholesterol metabolism and how they may contribute to understanding the etiology of complex neurodegenerative diseases.  
24553999	Network-wide dysregulation of calcium homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease.
Cell Tissue Res. 20140220 2014Aug
Dysregulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis has been proposed as a common proximal cause of neural dysfunction during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, aberrant Ca(2+) signaling has been viewed as a neuronal phenomenon mostly related to the dysfunction of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. However, recent data suggest that, in AD, Ca(2+) dyshomeostasis is not restricted to neurons but represents a global phenomenon affecting virtually all cells in the brain. AD-related aberrant Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytes and microglia, which is activated during the disease, probably contributes profoundly to an inflammatory response that, in turn, impacts neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis and brain function. Based on recent data obtained in vivo and in vitro, we propose that bidirectional interactions between the inflammatory responses of glial cells and aberrant Ca(2+) signaling represent a vicious cycle accelerating disease progression.  
24870034	Genome-wide analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae identifies cellular processes affecting intracellular aggregation of Alzheimer's amyloid-Î²42: importance of lipid homeostasis.
Mol. Biol. Cell 20140528 2014Aug1
Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)-containing plaques are a major neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The two major isoforms of AÎ² peptide associated with AD are AÎ²40 and AÎ²42, of which the latter is highly prone to aggregation. Increased presence and aggregation of intracellular AÎ²42 peptides is an early event in AD progression. Improved understanding of cellular processes affecting AÎ²42 aggregation may have implications for development of therapeutic strategies. AÎ²42 fused to green fluorescent protein (AÎ²42-GFP) was expressed in âˆ¼4600 mutants of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-wide deletion library to identify proteins and cellular processes affecting intracellular AÎ²42 aggregation by assessing the fluorescence of AÎ²42-GFP. This screening identified 110 mutants exhibiting intense AÎ²42-GFP-associated fluorescence. Four major cellular processes were overrepresented in the data set, including phospholipid homeostasis. Disruption of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and/or phosphatidylethanolamine metabolism had a major effect on intracellular AÎ²42 aggregation and localization. Confocal microscopy indicated that AÎ²42-GFP localization in the phospholipid mutants was juxtaposed to the nucleus, most likely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER membrane. These data provide a genome-wide indication of cellular processes that affect intracellular AÎ²42-GFP aggregation and may have important implications for understanding cellular mechanisms affecting intracellular AÎ²42 aggregation and AD disease progression.  
24549099	Plasma prion protein concentration and progression of Alzheimer disease.
Prion 20140218 2014Feb18
Recently, PrP(c) has been linked to AD pathogenesis. Second, a relation of PrP(c) plasma levels with cognitive status and decline of healthy elderly subjects has been reported. Therefore, we hypothesized baseline plasma levels of PrP(c) to be associated with AD progression in cognitive and functional domains. AD patients (n = 84) were included into an observational study at time of diagnosis. Baseline plasma PrP(c) levels were determined. Decline was assessed annually (mean follow-up time 3 years) with the aid of different standardized tests (MMSE, iADL, bADL, GDS, UPDRSIII). Multiple regression analyses were used to uncover potential associations between decline and PrP(c) levels. No association of PrP(c) and decline could be established. Presence of diabetes mellitus was linked to slower deterioration. Intake of neuroleptic drugs or memantine was associated with faster progression. Plasma PrP(c) at baseline could not be shown to be related to AD progression in this study. An interesting association of diabetes mellitus and decline warrants further investigation. 
23963290	Behavioral syndromes in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Behavioral disturbances belong to the core symptoms of dementia and are also common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The identification of sets of symptoms is clinically interesting, as interventions targeting syndromes may be more effective than the management of individual symptoms. This study aimed to identify, describe, measure, and compare the fundamental behavioral syndromes that underlie the observed behavioral symptoms in MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a prospective, longitudinal study on behavioral symptoms in MCI and dementia was performed. The study population consisted of 270 MCI and 402 AD patients. Behavioral assessment was performed by means of Middelheim Frontality Score (MFS), Behave-AD, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). Principal components factor analysis with Direct Oblimin rotation was carried out on the MFS score â‰¥5, seven cluster scores of the Behave-AD and the total scores of the CMAI and the CSDD. We identified three factors explaining behavior in the MCI group: a depression, a psychosis, and an agitation syndrome. Similar factors were found in AD, but the order: an agitation, a depression, and a psychosis syndrome, respectively, and the structure differed slightly. Diurnal rhythm disturbances and frontal lobe symptoms loaded with the depression syndrome in MCI and in AD they loaded with the agitation syndrome. Behavioral syndromes correlated in AD, but not in MCI, and the prevalence and severity of the behavioral syndromes were higher in AD than in MCI, except for the severity of the depression syndrome. In both MCI and AD, three similar behavioral syndromes exist, but behavior in MCI is more dominated by a depression syndrome, while behavior in AD is more subject to an agitation syndrome. 
24144550	Bizarre behaviors and risk assessment in 3xTg-AD mice at early stages of the disease.
Behav. Brain Res. 20131019 2014Jan1
Bizarre behaviors (stereotyped stretching, stereotyped rearing, backward movements and jumps) were conspicuously elicited in classical unconditioned tests with different levels of anxiogenic conditions. They were characterized for the first time as early-BPSD-like symptoms in 6 month-old male and female 3xTg-AD mice. The pattern of these behaviors differed from that exhibited by their age- and gender-matched NTg counterparts. Confrontation of an open and illuminated field was the best trigger of such behaviors as compared to mild neophobia in the corner test or the choice between two compartments in the dark-light box. Here we also report that increased freezing, delayed thigmotaxis and enhancement of emotional behaviors were early BPSD-like symptoms indicative of their response to low-stressful environments. Independently of the genotype, consistent gender effects pointed toward the relevance of female gender to study bizarre behaviors and risk assessment. The identification of items of behavior and its gender component were relevant to find out bidirectional and selective behavioral long-lasting effects of postnatal handling. This early life treatment reduced freezing and most of the bizarre behaviors whereas potentiated risk assessment and the horizontal locomotor activity. In contrast, vertical exploratory activity was not modified by the treatment. The results also talk in favor of the beneficence of early-life interventions on the behavioral outcome in adulthood in both healthy and disease conditions. As shown, the consideration of bizarre behaviors and risk assessment may become an additional tool for evaluating BPSD-like symptoms in relation to preventive and/or therapeutical strategies targeted at AD. It may also have a role in the evaluation of the potential risk factors for the disease.  
23612599	Pentosidine determination in CSF: a potential biomarker of Alzheimer's disease?
Clin. Chem. Lab. Med.  2014Jan1
The histopathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD) include neuronal cell death, formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Glycoxidation plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis, as pentosidine and NÎµ- carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), were detected in AD hallmarks, and in vivo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the definitive role of AGEs in the neuropathology of AD is inconclusive. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the level of pentosidine in CSF of patients affected by neurological disorders, including probable AD, in order to assess the feasibility of AGEs detection in CSF and to explore pentosidine as a potential biomarker in AD. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with AD (NINCDS ADRDA criteria) and different neurological disorders were enrolled. Diabetic patients were excluded. Pentosidine, CML, amyloid Î²1-42 were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Odetti modified method,and by sandwich ELISA respectively. Our data showed the presence of pentosidine in all CSF samples, a significant increase in CSF pentosidine levels with age (p&lt;0.05) and a significant decreased concentration of pentosidine in four AD subjects (p&lt;0.01), after normalization to CSF protein concentration. The study showed that AGEs concentration in CSF might benefit from age correction, at least for pentosidine, originally addressing a potential systemic age-dependent AGEs accumulation. The significant decrease of CSF pentosidine in AD, even in 4 patients, might conceive that different AGEs inform specific types of neurodegeneration, depending on oxidative stress levels, blood - brain barrier permeability, brain localization and systemic risk factors. 
24381967	Effect of vitamin E and memantine on functional decline in Alzheimer disease: the TEAM-AD VA cooperative randomized trial.
JAMA  2014Jan1
Although vitamin E and memantine have been shown to have beneficial effects in moderately severe Alzheimer disease (AD), evidence is limited in mild to moderate AD. To determine if vitamin E (alpha tocopherol), memantine, or both slow progression of mild to moderate AD in patients taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial involving 613 patients with mild to moderate AD initiated in August 2007 and concluded in September 2012 at 14 Veterans Affairs medical centers. Participants received either 2000 IU/d of alpha tocopherol (nâ€‰=â€‰152), 20 mg/d of memantine (nâ€‰=â€‰155), the combination (nâ€‰=â€‰154), or placebo (nâ€‰=â€‰152). Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Inventory score (range, 0-78). Secondary outcomes included cognitive, neuropsychiatric, functional, and caregiver measures. Data from 561 participants were analyzed (alpha tocopherolâ€‰=â€‰140, memantineâ€‰=â€‰142, combinationâ€‰=â€‰139, placeboâ€‰=â€‰140), with 52 excluded because of a lack of any follow-up data. Over the mean (SD) follow-up of 2.27 (1.22) years, ADCS-ADL Inventory scores declined by 3.15 units (95% CI, 0.92 to 5.39; adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰.03) less in the alpha tocopherol group compared with the placebo group. In the memantine group, these scores declined 1.98 units less (95% CI, -0.24 to 4.20; adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰.40) than the placebo group's decline. This change in the alpha tocopherol group translates into a delay in clinical progression of 19% per year compared with placebo or a delay of approximately 6.2 months over the follow-up period. Caregiver time increased least in the alpha tocopherol group. All-cause mortality and safety analyses showed a difference only on the serious adverse event of "infections or infestations," with greater frequencies in the memantine (31 events in 23 participants) and combination groups (44 events in 31 participants) compared with placebo (13 events in 11 participants). Among patients with mild to moderate AD, 2000 IU/d of alpha tocopherol compared with placebo resulted in slower functional decline. There were no significant differences in the groups receiving memantine alone or memantine plus alpha tocopherol. These findings suggest benefit of alpha tocopherol in mild to moderate AD by slowing functional decline and decreasing caregiver burden. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00235716. 
24402389	Utility of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT for dementia diagnoses and therapeutic strategies in elderly patients.
J Nutr Health Aging  2014Jan
Evaluation of the influence of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the dopamine transporter (123I-FP-CIT) on diagnosis and treatment strategies in elderly patients with mild dementia. Retrospective study. Geriatrics memory clinic. Consecutive ambulatory patients who had 123I-FP-CIT SPECT for a suspicion of DLB. Clinical diagnoses before SPECT were compared with imaging results. 46 patients were included. Pre imaging clinical hypotheses were probable DLB in 14, possible DLB in 21 and alternate diagnoses in 11. Rates of abnormal imaging in these groups were respectively 71%, 43% and 18%. Overall, diagnoses were revised in 37% of the cases. Four patients with probable DLB had normal imaging. Their number of core criteria did not differ from the remainder (2.75 Â± 0.5 vs. 2.1 Â± 0.6), but hallucinations in 2 patients were not well formed and detailed as usual in DLB. Among 38 patients free of antipsychotics, rates of abnormal scans were 36% in patients with questionable parkinsonism, 57% in definite parkinsonism, 67% in patients with no parkinsonism. Among 9 patients on Levodopa, 6 had normal scans and Levodopa was stopped. We show a significant impact of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT on diagnoses, even in cases of definite parkinsonism or probable DLB. In the latter, scarcity of hallucinations, especially if there are not well formed and detailed, should prompt 123I-FP-CIT SPECT. 
24336208	Rare coding variants in the phospholipase D3 gene confer risk for Alzheimer's disease.
Nature 20131211 2014Jan23
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk variants for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). These common variants have replicable but small effects on LOAD risk and generally do not have obvious functional effects. Low-frequency coding variants, not detected by GWAS, are predicted to include functional variants with larger effects on risk. To identify low-frequency coding variants with large effects on LOAD risk, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 14 large LOAD families and follow-up analyses of the candidate variants in several large LOAD case-control data sets. A rare variant in PLD3 (phospholipase D3; Val232Met) segregated with disease status in two independent families and doubled risk for Alzheimer's disease in seven independent case-control series with a total of more than 11,000 cases and controls of European descent. Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387 cases and controls of European descent and 302 African American cases and controls, with complete sequence data for PLD3, reveal that several variants in this gene increase risk for Alzheimer's disease in both populations. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain regions that are vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology, including hippocampus and cortex, and is expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons from Alzheimer's disease brains compared to control brains. Overexpression of PLD3 leads to a significant decrease in intracellular amyloid-Î² precursor protein (APP) and extracellular AÎ²42 and AÎ²40 (the 42- and 40-residue isoforms of the amyloid-Î² peptide), and knockdown of PLD3 leads to a significant increase in extracellular AÎ²42 and AÎ²40. Together, our genetic and functional data indicate that carriers of PLD3 coding variants have a twofold increased risk for LOAD and that PLD3 influences APP processing. This study provides an example of how densely affected families may help to identify rare variants with large effects on risk for disease or other complex traits.  
24468453	[Recommendations for diagnosis and therapy of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD)].
Praxis (Bern 1994)  2014Jan29
In patients with dementia, Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are frequent findings that accompany deficits caused by cognitive impairment and thus complicate diagnostics, therapy and care. BPSD are a burden both for affected individuals as well as care-givers, and represent a significant challenge for therapy of a patient population with high degree of multi-morbidity. The goal of this therapy-guideline issued by swiss professional associations is to present guidance regarding therapy of BPSD as attendant symptoms in dementia, based on evidence as well as clinical experience. Here it appears to be of particular importance to take into account professional experience, as at this point for most therapeutic options no sufficiently controlled clinical trials are available. A critical discussion of pharmaco-therapeutic intervention is necessary, as this patient-population is particularly vulnerable for medication side-effects. Finally, a particular emphasis is placed on incorporating and systematically reporting psycho-social and nursing options therapeutic intervention.  
24616709	Detection of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Defects in Alzheimer's Disease Using SD-OCT.
Front Psychiatry 20140225 2014
Our aim is to examine the clinical value of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Spectralis OCT) to detect retinal nerve fibre layer defects in patients with clinically defined Alzheimer's disease (AD). This cross-sectional study included 22 patients with AD (mean age: 75.9â€‰Â±â€‰6.1â€‰years) and 22 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Neuro-ophthalmologic examinations and a series of high-resolution OCT examinations of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness using the Spectralis 3.5-mm circle scan protocol with ART-Modus and eye tracking were obtained, and compared to age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Patients with AD showed a significant decrease in RNFL thickness in the nasal superior sector compared to the control group (101.0â€‰Â±â€‰18.18â€‰Î¼m versus 122.8â€‰Â±â€‰28.08â€‰Î¼m; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001). In all other sectors, independently of disease duration, no significant difference in RNFL thickness compared to controls was detected. Using the advanced age- and gender-matched measurement model, 32 out of 42 eyes (76.19%) as pathologic with 67 abnormal sectors were detected. As examined by spectral-domain OCT, patients with mild to moderate stages of AD showed a significant reduction of RNFL thickness in the nasal superior sector. Nevertheless, successive studies are needed. 
24678298	Anodal tDCS during face-name associations memory training in Alzheimer's patients.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140319 2014
Given the limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological interventions to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) have gained attention in recent years. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS (AtDCS) combined with memory training on face-name associations in an AD patient sample. Thirty six AD patients were randomly assigned to one of three study groups: Group 1, AtDCS plus individualized computerized memory training; Group 2, placebo tDCS plus individualized computerized memory training; Group 3, AtDCS plus motor training. A general improvement in performance was observed after 2 weeks of memory training. Both the anodal tDCS plus individualized computerized memory training and the placebo tDCS plus individualized computerized memory training groups had significantly improved performances at 2 weeks compared with the AtDCS plus motor training group. Our findings suggest a beneficial effect of individualized memory rehabilitation in AD patients. 
24715863	Meta-Review of CSF Core Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: The State-of-the-Art after the New Revised Diagnostic Criteria.

Current research criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers into the diagnostic algorithm. However, spreading their use to the clinical routine is still questionable. To provide an updated, systematic and critical review on the diagnostic utility of the CSF core biomarkers for AD. MEDLINE, PreMedline, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and CRD. (1a) Systematic reviews with meta-analysis; (1b) Primary studies published after the new revised diagnostic criteria; (2) Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of at least one CSF core biomarker. The diagnostic performance of CSF biomarkers is generally satisfactory. They are optimal for discriminating AD patients from healthy controls. Their combination may also be suitable for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prognosis. However, CSF biomarkers fail to distinguish AD from other forms of dementia. (1) Use of clinical diagnosis as standard instead of pathological postmortem confirmation; (2) variability of methodological aspects; (3) insufficiently long follow-up periods in MCI studies; and (4) lower diagnostic accuracy in primary care compared with memory clinics. Additional work needs to be done to validate the application of CSF core biomarkers as they are proposed in the new revised diagnostic criteria. The use of CSF core biomarkers in clinical routine is more likely if these limitations are overcome. Early diagnosis is going to be of utmost importance when effective pharmacological treatment will be available and the CSF core biomarkers can also be implemented in clinical trials for drug development. 
24694197	Association of genetic variants in senataxin and Alzheimer's disease in a chinese han population in taiwan.
Chin J Physiol  2014Apr30
Development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neuronal death and a decline in learning and memory. Mutations in human senataxin (SETX), an ortholog yeast protein of Sen1, have been identified to cause the syndrome of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) and juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS4), two types of progressive motor neuron degeneration. However, the relationship between the SETX gene, which is involved in the regulation of RNA processing and DNA repair, and the predisposition for AD remains unclear. In this research, potential association of polymorphisms in the SETX gene with AD was investigated. A case-control study of a Chinese Han population in Taiwan was performed. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3455T&gt;G (rs3739922), 3576T&gt;G (rs1185193) and 7759A&gt;G (rs1056899) were studied. The experimental data showed that upon genotyping of the exonic polymorphism in the SETX gene, the T allele appeared at a lower rate than the G allele at position 3455 in AD patients compared with normal groups (P &lt; 0.05, odds ratio (OR), 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40-0.89). Subjects with the GA genotype at position 7759 have higher incidences of AD development than with the AA genotype (P &lt; 0.05, OR, 6.45, 95% CI, 1.24 to 33.70). Our results also showed that with six haplotypes (Hts) observed from the analyzed polymorphisms, distributions of the Ht4-GAA and Ht5-GCA haplotypes appeared to be significant 'risk' haplotypes between AD patients and controls (both P &lt; 0.05, OR, 8.44, 95% CI, 1.07-66.60). These observations suggest that genetic variations in the SETX gene may contribute to AD pathogenesis in the Taiwanese Han population.  
24948022	[Vitamin D and Alzheimer's disease: from an intriguing idea to a therapeutic option].
Biol Aujourdhui 20140623 2014
Beyond the classically described regulation of calcium and bone metabolism, vitamin D is a neurosteroid hormone essential to neurophysiological function (regulation of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins) with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant neuroprotective action. In contrast, hypovitaminosis D, which is extremely frequent in the elderly, may result in neurological dysfunction and may explain part of the cognitive disorders in this population. Epidemiology is consistent with this notion and has repeatedly shown an association between hypovitaminosis D and cognitive decline, either in the general population or in Alzheimer's patients. Preliminary intervention trials confirm the causal relationship and quantify the cognitive effect of vitamin D supplementation in the elderly. This raises prospects for primary/secondary prevention of cognitive decline by exogenous supplies of vitamin D. In particular, although current anti-dementia drugs are only symptomatic, future treatment options could rely on drug combinations preventing several neurodegenerative mechanisms at once. As such, vitamin D enhances the efficacy of memantine in terms of neuronal protection and prevention of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.  
24689864	Intrinsic brain activity of cognitively normal older persons resembles more that of patients both with and at risk for Alzheimer's disease than that of healthy younger persons.
Brain Connect  2014Jun
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent findings suggest that amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)-pathology might start 20-30 years before first cognitive symptoms arise. To account for age as most relevant risk factor for sporadic AD, it has been hypothesized that lifespan intrinsic (i.e., ongoing) activity of hetero-modal brain areas with highest levels of functional connectivity triggers AÎ²-pathology. This model induces the simple question whether in older persons without any cognitive symptoms intrinsic activity of hetero-modal areas is more similar to that of symptomatic patients with AD or to that of younger healthy persons. We hypothesize that due to advanced age and therefore potential impact of pre-clinical AD, intrinsic activity of older persons resembles more that of patients than that of younger controls. We tested this hypothesis in younger (ca. 25 years) and older healthy persons (ca. 70 years) and patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD-dementia (ca. 70 years) by the use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, distinct measures of intrinsic brain activity, and different hierarchical clustering approaches. Independently of applied methods and involved areas, healthy older persons' intrinsic brain activity was consistently more alike that of patients than that of younger controls. Our result provides evidence for larger similarity in intrinsic brain activity between healthy older persons and patients with or at-risk for AD than between older and younger ones, suggesting a significant proportion of pre-clinical AD cases in the group of cognitively normal older people. The observed link of aging and AD with intrinsic brain activity supports the view that lifespan intrinsic activity may contribute critically to the pathogenesis of AD. 
24735020	Single-subject gray matter graph properties and their relationship with cognitive impairment in early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Brain Connect  2014Jun
Abstract We investigated the relationships between gray matter graph properties and cognitive impairment in a sample of 215 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also whether age of disease onset modifies such relationships. We expected that more severe cognitive impairment in AD would be related to more random graph topologies. Single-subject gray matter graphs were constructed from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. The following global and local graph properties were calculated: betweenness centrality, normalized clustering coefficient Î³, and normalized path length Î». Local clustering, path length, and betweenness centrality measures were determined for 90 anatomically defined areas. Regression models with as interaction term age of onset (i.e., early onset when patients were â‰¤65 years old and late onset when they were &gt;65 years old at the time of diagnosis)Ã—graph property were used to assess the relationships between cognitive functioning in five domains (memory, language, visuospatial, attention, and executive). Worse cognitive impairment was associated with more random graphs, as indicated by low Î³, Î», and betweenness centrality values. Three interaction effects for age of onsetÃ—global graph property were found: Low Î³ and Î» values more strongly related to memory impairment in early-onset patients; low beta values were significantly related to impaired visuospatial functioning in late-onset patients. For the local graph properties, language impairment showed the strongest relationship with decreased clustering coefficient in the left superior temporal gyrus across the entire sample. Our study shows that single-subject gray matter graph properties are associated with individual differences in cognitive impairment.  
24796856	Network dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: refining the disconnection hypothesis.
Brain Connect  2014Jun
Much effort in recent years has focused on understanding the effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on neural function. This effort has resulted in an enormous number of papers describing different facets of the functional derangement seen in AD. A particularly important tool for these investigations has been resting-state functional connectivity. Attempts to comprehensively synthesize resting-state functional connectivity results have focused on the potential utility of functional connectivity as a biomarker for disease risk, disease staging, or prognosis. While these are all appropriate uses of this technique, the purpose of this review is to examine how functional connectivity disruptions inform our understanding of AD pathophysiology. Here, we examine the rationale and methodological considerations behind functional connectivity studies and then provide a critical review of the existing literature. In conclusion, we propose a hypothesis regarding the development and spread of functional connectivity deficits seen in AD. 
24870443	In Alzheimer's disease, hypometabolism in low-amyloid brain regions may be a functional consequence of pathologies in connected brain regions.
Brain Connect  2014Jun
In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), prominent hypometabolism has been observed in brain regions with minor amyloid load. These hypometabolism-only (HO) areas cannot be explained merely as a consequence of local amyloid toxicity. The aim of this multimodal imaging study was to explore whether such HO phenomenon may be related to pathologies in functionally connected, remote brain regions. Nineteen AD patients and 15 matched controls underwent examinations with [(11)C]PiB-PET and [(18)F]FDG-PET. Voxel-based statistical group comparisons were performed to obtain maps of significantly elevated amyloid burden and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism, respectively, in patients. An HO area was identified by subtraction of equally thresholded result maps (hypometabolism minus amyloid burden). To identify the network typically functionally connected to this HO area, it was used as a seed region for a functional connectivity analysis in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 17 elderly healthy controls. The resulting intrinsic connectivity network (HO-ICN) was retransferred into the brains of AD patients to be able to analyze pathologies within this network in the positron emission tomography (PET) datasets. The most prominent HO area was detected in the left middle frontal gyrus of AD patients. The HO-ICN in healthy controls showed a major overlap with brain areas significantly affected by both amyloid deposition and hypometabolism in patients. This association was substantiated by the results of region-of-interest-based and voxel-wise correlation analyses, which revealed strong correlations between the degree of hypometabolism within the HO region and within the HO-ICN. These results support the notion that hypometabolism in brain regions not strongly affected by locoregional amyloid pathology may be related to ongoing pathologies in remote but functionally connected regions, that is, by reduced neuronal input from these regions. 
24901258	Directed progression brain networks in Alzheimer's disease: properties and classification.
Brain Connect  2014Jun
This article introduces a new approach in brain connectomics aimed at characterizing the temporal spread in the brain of pathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main instrument is the development of "directed progression networks" (DPNets), wherein one constructs directed edges between nodes based on (weakly) inferred directions of the temporal spreading of the pathology. This stands in contrast to many previously studied brain networks where edges represent correlations, physical connections, or functional progressions. In addition, this is one of a few studies showing the value of using directed networks in the study of AD. This article focuses on the construction of DPNets for AD using longitudinal cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance imaging data. The network properties are then characterized, providing new insights into AD progression, as well as novel markers for differentiating normal cognition (NC) and AD at the group level. It also demonstrates the important role of nodal variations for network classification (i.e., the significance of standard deviations, not just mean values of nodal properties). Finally, the DPNets are utilized to classify subjects based on their global network measures using a variety of data-mining methodologies. In contrast to most brain networks, these DPNets do not show high clustering and small-world properties. 
24571648	Aggregates of small nuclear ribonucleic acids (snRNAs) in Alzheimer's disease.
Brain Pathol. 20140414 2014Jul
We recently discovered that protein components of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) spliceosome form cytoplasmic aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, resulting in widespread changes in RNA splicing. However, the involvement of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), also key components of the spliceosome complex, in the pathology of AD remains unknown. Using immunohistochemical staining of post-mortem human brain and spinal cord, we identified cytoplasmic tangle-shaped aggregates of snRNA in both sporadic and familial AD cases but not in aged controls or other neurodegenerative disorders. Immunofluorescence using antibodies reactive with the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap of snRNAs and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated snRNA localization with tau and paired helical filaments, the main component of neurofibrillary tangles. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed U1 snRNA accumulation in the insoluble fraction of AD brains whereas other U snRNAs were not enriched. In combination with our previous results, these findings demonstrate that aggregates of U1 snRNA and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins represent a new pathological hallmark of AD.  
24946075	The pericyte: a forgotten cell type with important implications for Alzheimer's disease?
Brain Pathol.  2014Jul
Pericytes are cells in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that degenerate in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early neurovascular dysfunction, elevation of amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²), tau pathology and neuronal loss, leading to progressive cognitive decline and dementia. Pericytes are uniquely positioned within the neurovascular unit between endothelial cells of brain capillaries, astrocytes and neurons. Recent studies have shown that pericytes regulate key neurovascular functions including BBB formation and maintenance, vascular stability and angioarchitecture, regulation of capillary blood flow, and clearance of toxic cellular by-products necessary for normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we review the concept of the neurovascular unit and neurovascular functions of CNS pericytes. Next, we discuss vascular contributions to AD and review new roles of pericytes in the pathogenesis of AD such as vascular-mediated AÎ²-independent neurodegeneration, regulation of AÎ² clearance and contributions to tau pathology, neuronal loss and cognitive decline. We conclude that future studies should focus on molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying aberrant signal transduction between pericytes and its neighboring cells within the neurovascular unit, that is, endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons, which could represent potential therapeutic targets to control pericyte degeneration in AD and the resulting secondary vascular and neuronal degeneration.  
24798577	Research and development of anti-Alzheimer's drugs: an analysis based on technology flows measured by patent citations.
Expert Opin Ther Pat 20140505 2014Jul
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious illness with dramatically increasing incidence. Tremendous worldwide efforts have been exerted to find better ways to treat the disease, delay its onset and prevent it from progressing. In order to discover future anti-AD medicines more rationally, it is crucial to understand the evolving process of existing related technologies from the perspective of technology flow. Patent citation has been used broadly as a powerful tool to capture technology flows. This study collects patent data from IMS Health databases on anti-AD drugs, both marketed and in the research and development (R&amp;D) pipeline. In all, 329 US patents from 1978 through 2013 and citations between them are analyzed, in addition to patents related to marketed drugs. To discover effective agents for AD treatment, one promising strategy is to integrate various technology clusters related to anti-AD drugs in terms of the extremely dispersed patent citation network in this area. In this context, governments should pay more attention to encourage basic research, especially to focus on cross-mechanism anti-AD agents. New theories and targets for AD, such as the tau protein hypothesis, are worthy of researcher note. Drugs targeting Î²-amyloid peptide theory show promise for investors. 
24807206	Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan prevents and rescues cerebrovascular, neuropathological and cognitive deficits in an Alzheimer's disease model.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20140505 2014Aug
Angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blockers that bind selectively AngII type 1 (AT1) receptors may protect from Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied the ability of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan to cure or prevent AD hallmarks in aged (~18months at endpoint, 3months treatment) or adult (~12months at endpoint, 10months treatment) human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. We tested learning and memory with the Morris water maze, and evaluated neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling using [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET and laser Doppler flowmetry responses to whisker stimulation. Cerebrovascular reactivity was assessed with on-line videomicroscopy. We measured protein levels of oxidative stress enzymes (superoxide dismutases SOD1, SOD2 and NADPH oxidase subunit p67phox), and quantified soluble and deposited amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), AngII receptors AT1 and AT2, angiotensin IV receptor AT4, and cortical cholinergic innervation. In aged APP mice, losartan did not improve learning but it consolidated memory acquisition and recall, and rescued neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling and cerebrovascular dilatory capacity. Losartan normalized cerebrovascular p67phox and SOD2 protein levels and up-regulated those of SOD1. Losartan attenuated astrogliosis, normalized AT1 and AT4 receptor levels, but failed to rescue the cholinergic deficit and the AÎ² pathology. Given preventively, losartan protected cognitive function, cerebrovascular reactivity, and AT4 receptor levels. Like in aged APP mice, these benefits occurred without a decrease in soluble AÎ² species or plaque load. We conclude that losartan exerts potent preventive and restorative effects on AD hallmarks, possibly by mitigating AT1-initiated oxidative stress and normalizing memory-related AT4 receptors.  
24753305	Structural evolution and membrane interactions of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide oligomers: new knowledge from single-molecule fluorescence studies.
Protein Sci. 20140604 2014Jul
Amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) oligomers may represent the proximal neurotoxin in Alzheimer's disease. Single-molecule microscopy (SMM) techniques have recently emerged as a method for overcoming the innate difficulties of working with amyloid-Î², including the peptide's low endogenous concentrations, the dynamic nature of its oligomeric states, and its heterogeneous and complex membrane interactions. SMM techniques have revealed that small oligomers of the peptide bind to model membranes and cells at low nanomolar-to-picomolar concentrations and diffuse at rates dependent on the membrane characteristics. These methods have also shown that oligomers grow or dissociate based on the presence of specific inhibitors or promoters and on the ratio of AÎ²40 to AÎ²42. Here, we discuss several types of single-molecule imaging that have been applied to the study of AÎ² oligomers and their membrane interactions. We also summarize some of the recent insights SMM has provided into oligomer behavior in solution, on planar lipid membranes, and on living cell membranes. A brief overview of the current limitations of the technique, including the lack of sensitive assays for AÎ²-induced toxicity, is included in hopes of inspiring future development in this area of research. 
24893984	Potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate improves memory deficits and attenuates amyloid and Ï„ pathologies in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 20140603 2014Aug
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Dl-PHPB [potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate], has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemic, vascular dementia, and AÎ²-induced animal models by inhibiting oxidative injury, neuronal apoptosis, and glial activation. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of dl-PHPB on learning and memory in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic AD mouse models (APP/PS1) and the mechanisms of dl-PHPB in reducing AÎ² accumulation and Ï„ phosphorylation. Twelve-month-old APP/PS1 mice were given 30 mg/kg dl-PHPB by oral gavage for 3 months. Dl-PHPB treatment significantly improved the spatial learning and memory deficits compared with the vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice. In the meantime, dl-PHPB obviously reduced Ï„ hyperphosphorylation at Ser199, Thr205, and Ser396 sites in APP/PS1 mice. This reduction was accompanied by APP phosphorylation reduction and protein kinase C activation. In addition, expression of cyclin-dependent kinase and glycogen synthase kinase 3Î², the most important kinases involved in Ï„ phosphorylation, was markedly decreased by dl-PHPB treatment. Phosphorylated protein kinase B and phosphoinositide 3-kinase levels of APP/PS1 mice were significantly reduced compared with levels in wild-type mice, and dl-PHPB reversed the reduction. The effects of dl-PHPB effecting a decrease in Ï„ phosphorylation and kinase activation were further confirmed in neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells overexpressing wild-type human APP695. These data raised the possibility that dl-PHPB might be a promising multitarget neuronal protective agent for the treatment of AD.

25016785	[Biomarkers of Alzheimer disease].
Prz. Lek.  2014
Cognitive impairment is one of the most abundant age-related psychiatric disorders. The outcome of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease has both individual (the patients and their families) and socio-economic effects. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease doubles after the age of 65 years, every 4.5 years. An etiologically heterogenic group of disorders related to aging as well as genetic and environmental interactions probably underlie the impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Those factors cause the degeneration of brain tissue which leads to significant cognitive dysfunction. There are two main hypotheses that are linked to the process of neurodegeneration: (i) amyloid cascade and (ii) the role of secretases and dysfunction of mitochondria. From the therapeutic standpoint it is crucial to get an early diagnosis and start with an adequate treatment. The undeniable progress in the field of biomarker research should lead to a better understanding of the early stages of the disorder. So far, the best recognised and described biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, which can be detected in both cerebrospinal fluid and blood, are: beta-amyloid, tau-protein and phosphorylated tau-protein (phospho-tau). The article discusses the usefulness of the known biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in early diagnosis. 
24992153	Brain-penetrant, orally bioavailable microtubule-stabilizing small molecules are potential candidate therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies.
J. Med. Chem. 20140703 2014Jul24
Microtubule (MT) stabilizing drugs hold promise as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. However, thus far epothilone D has been the only brain-penetrant MT-stabilizer to be evaluated in tau transgenic mice and in AD patients. Furthermore, this natural product exhibits potential deficiencies as a drug candidate, including an intravenous route of administration and the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transporter. Thus, the identification of alternative CNS-active MT-stabilizing agents that lack these potential limitations is of interest. Toward this objective, we have evaluated representative compounds from known classes of non-naturally occurring MT-stabilizing small molecules. This led to the identification of selected triazolopyrimidines and phenylpyrimidines that are orally bioavailable and brain-penetrant without disruption of Pgp function. Pharmacodynamic studies confirmed that representative compounds from these series enhance MT-stabilization in the brains of wild-type mice. Thus, these classes of MT-stabilizers hold promise for the development of orally active, CNS-directed MT-stabilizing therapies.  
25061748	Cloning and Characterization of a Norbelladine 4'-O-Methyltransferase Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Alzheimer's Drug Galanthamine in Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus.
PLoS ONE 20140725 2014
Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This compound is primarily isolated from daffodil (Narcissus spp.), snowdrop (Galanthus spp.), and summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum). Despite its importance as a medicine, no genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of galanthamine have been identified. This absence of genetic information on biosynthetic pathways is a limiting factor in the development of synthetic biology platforms for many important botanical medicines. The paucity of information is largely due to the limitations of traditional methods for finding biochemical pathway enzymes and genes in non-model organisms. A new bioinformatic approach using several recent technological improvements was applied to search for genes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway, first targeting methyltransferases due to strong signature amino acid sequences in the proteins. Using Illumina sequencing, a de novo transcriptome assembly was constructed for daffodil. BLAST was used to identify sequences that contain signatures for plant O-methyltransferases in this transcriptome. The program HAYSTACK was then used to identify methyltransferases that fit a model for galanthamine biosynthesis in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues. One candidate gene for the methylation of norbelladine to 4'-O-methylnorbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway was identified. This methyltransferase cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the protein purified by affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was found to be a norbelladine 4'-O-methyltransferase (NpN4OMT) of the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway.  
25049335	Acid sphingomyelinase modulates the autophagic process by controlling lysosomal biogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Exp. Med. 20140721 2014Jul28
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), abnormal sphingolipid metabolism has been reported, although the pathogenic consequences of these changes have not been fully characterized. We show that acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is increased in fibroblasts, brain, and/or plasma from patients with AD and in AD mice, leading to defective autophagic degradation due to lysosomal depletion. Partial genetic inhibition of ASM (ASM(+/-)) in a mouse model of familial AD (FAD; amyloid precursor protein [APP]/presenilin 1 [PS1]) ameliorated the autophagocytic defect by restoring lysosomal biogenesis, resulting in improved AD clinical and pathological findings, including reduction of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposition and improvement of memory impairment. Similar effects were noted after pharmacologic restoration of ASM to the normal range in APP/PS1 mice. Autophagic dysfunction in neurons derived from FAD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was restored by partial ASM inhibition. Overall, these results reveal a novel mechanism of ASM pathogenesis in AD that leads to defective autophagy due to impaired lysosomal biogenesis and suggests that partial ASM inhibition is a potential new therapeutic intervention for the disease.  
24335160	Taking advantage of physiological proteolytic processing of the prion protein for a therapeutic perspective in prion and Alzheimer diseases.
Prion  2014 Jan-Feb
Prion and Alzheimer diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by misfolding and aggregation of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and the Î²-amyloid peptide, respectively. Soluble oligomeric species rather than large aggregates are now believed to be neurotoxic. PrP(C) undergoes three proteolytic cleavages as part of its natural life cycle, Î±-cleavage, Î²-cleavage, and ectodomain shedding. Recent evidences demonstrate that the resulting secreted PrP(C) molecules might represent natural inhibitors against soluble toxic species. In this mini-review, we summarize recent observations suggesting the potential benefit of using PrP(C)-derived molecules as therapeutic agents in prion and Alzheimer diseases. 
24553069	D-amino acid-based peptide inhibitors as early or preventative therapy in Alzheimer disease.
Prion  2014 Jan-Feb
Beta amyloid (AÎ²) accumulation is recognized as a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and the aggregation of AÎ² peptide is hypothesized to drive pathogenesis. As such, AÎ² is a logical target for therapeutic intervention and there have been many studies looking at diverse classes of drugs that target AÎ². Of concern is the recent failure of several clinical trials, highlighting the need for earlier, possibly preventative intervention, and raising the question of what form of AÎ² is the best target. The AÎ² oligomers are considered to be the toxic species, but many therapies, such as antibody therapies, target monomers, removing them as substrates for aggregation. Peptide inhibitors, in contrast, are able to interfere with the aggregation process itself. Designing peptide inhibitors requires some knowledge of AÎ² structure; while there is structural information about the amyloid core of AÎ² fibrils, the transient nature of oligomers makes them difficult to characterize. Fortunately, some interaction sites have been identified between monomers and oligomers of AÎ² and these, plus known aggregation-prone sequences in AÎ², can serve as a basis for inhibitor design. In this mini-review we focus on D-amino acid based peptide inhibitors and discuss how their non-toxic and stable nature can be beneficial, while they specifically target aggregation-prone sequences within the AÎ² peptide. Many peptide inhibitors have been designed using the LVFFA domain within AÎ² to disrupt the self-assembly of AÎ² peptide. While this may be sufficient to stop aggregation in vitro, other aggregation sites at the C-terminus may promote aggregation independently and the flexible N terminus may be a good target to induce clearance of aggregates. Ultimately, it may be a combination of targets that provides the best therapeutic strategy. 
25076779	[The involvement of hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulatingpeptide and its precursor in Alzheimer pathogenesis].
Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi  2014Jun
Hippocampal cholinergic neruostimulating peptide (HCNP) induces acethylcholine synthesis in the adult hippocampus of mice via increasing the amount of cholineacethyl transferase. The precursor protein of HCNP (HCNP-pp), composed of 186 amino acids, is a multifunctional protein, such as c-Raf kinase inhibitory protein and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein. In the adult hippocampus, HCNP-pp co-localizes in presynapse terminals with non-phosphorylated collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP)-2, and might play a crucial role in hippocampal neuronal activity. The quantitative alteration of HCNP-pp might be related to the phosphorylation of CRMP-2. The expression of HCNP-pp mRNA is decreased in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of CA1 from the early stage in Alzheimer's disease. The HCNP-related antigens are also deposited in the Hirano body, one locus of Alzheimer pathology. CRMP-2 is one of microtubule-associated proteins such as tau protein, and its phosphorylated form increased in the hippocampus of Alzheimer brains. HCNP and HCNP-pp might be candidates for the key molecules as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. 
25075530	Key network approach reveals new insight into Alzheimer's disease.
IET Syst Biol  2014Aug
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder without curative treatment. Extensive data on pathological molecular processes have been accumulated over the last years. These data combined allows a systems biology approach to identify key regulatory elements of AD and to establish a model descriptive of the disease process which can be used for the development of therapeutic agents. In this study, the authors propose a closed network that uses a set of nodes (amyloid beta, tau, beta-secretase, glutamate, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha) as key elements of importance to the pathogenesis of AD. The proposed network, in total 39 nodes, is able to become a novel tool capable of providing new insights into AD, such as feedback loops. Further, it highlights interconnections between pathways and identifies their combination for therapy of AD.  
24825898	A Neuroprotective Brain-penetrating Endopeptidase Fusion Protein Ameliorates Alzheimer Disease Pathology and Restores Neurogenesis.
J. Biol. Chem. 20140513 2014Jun20
Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration throughout the association cortex and limbic system, deposition of amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) in the neuropil and around the blood vessels, and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The endopeptidase neprilysin has been successfully used to reduce the accumulation of AÎ² following intracranial viral vector delivery or ex vivo manipulated intracranial delivery. These therapies have relied on direct injections into the brain, whereas a clinically desirable therapy would involve i.v. infusion of a recombinant enzyme. We previously characterized a recombinant neprilysin that contained a 38-amino acid brain-targeting domain. Recombinant cell lines have been generated expressing this brain-targeted enzyme (ASN12). In this report, we characterize the ASN12 recombinant protein for pharmacology in a mouse as well as efficacy in two APPtg mouse models of AD. The recombinant ASN12 transited to the brain with a tÂ½ of 24 h and accumulated to 1.7% of injected dose at 24 h following i.v. delivery. We examined pharmacodynamics in the tg2576 APPtg mouse with the prion promoter APP695 SWE mutation and in the Line41 mThy1 APP751 mutation mouse. Treatment of either APPtg mouse resulted in reduced AÎ², increased neuronal synapses, and improved learning and memory. In addition, the Line41 APPtg mice showed increased levels of C-terminal neuropeptide Y fragments and increased neurogenesis. These results suggest that the recombinant brain-targeted neprilysin, ASN12, may be an effective treatment for AD and warrant further investigation in clinical trials.  
24611490	A new role for the nonpathogenic nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms of acetylcholinesterase in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a computational study.
J. Comput. Biol. 20140310 2014Aug
Abstract Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are implicated in the complexity of understanding the genetics of diseases and their therapeutics. Here we have attempted to determine the impact of nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) on structure, dynamics, and ligand-binding properties of the human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) protein, which has been targeted in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Of the reported 153 SNPs, 4 nsSNPs, namely, A415G, P104A, V302E, and Y119H, were prioritized to be functionally unfavorable by SIFT and PolyPhen algorithms. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed these nsSNP forms to be structurally stable, and they are also considered functionally active as they lie away from the catalytic triad. However, the aromatic amino acids lining the active-site gorge exhibited altered degrees of side chain dihedral angles. Such conformational alterations were evaluated for their ability to interfere with binding of hAChE inhibitors. The inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine) were oriented differently in comparison to the native because of the steric hindrance offered by the altered dihedral angles. Interestingly, huperzine A alone exhibited higher efficiency in its binding to the AChE and retained similar orientation irrespective of the polymorphisms since the orientation of Asp74 involved in its binding and trafficking remained unaltered in all protein forms. Therefore, we conclude that nsSNPs confer changes to the dynamicity of proteins, which in turn affects their ligand-binding properties rather than their stability. Considering the diverse polymorphic nature of hAChE, while contemplating any structure-based drug design, the common, nonpathogenic nsSNPs should be considered for the utmost efficacy of drugs.  
24662962	Effects of naproxen on immune responses in a colchicine-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroimmunomodulation 20140321 2014
The components of the immune system have been indicated to be linked with the neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The participation of the immune system in the neurodegeneration in a rat model of colchicine-induced AD has not been explored. In the present study, hippocampal neurodegeneration along with reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrite and TNF-Î± in the hippocampus and some systemic immune responses were measured after 15 and 21 days of intracerebroventricular colchicine injection in rats and again after oral administration of different doses of the anti-inflammatory drug naproxen in AD rats. Chromatolysis and amyloid plaques were found along with higher ROS, nitrite and TNF-Î± levels in the hippocampus of colchicine-induced AD rats, and these changes were prevented by naproxen in a dose-dependent manner. Alterations in immunological parameters [increased phagocytic activity of white blood cells and splenic polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), increased cytotoxicity and decreased leucocyte adhesive inhibition index (LAI) of splenic mononuclear cells (MNC)] were also observed in colchicine-injected rats, which showed a dose-dependent recovery after oral administration of naproxen in AD rats. The number of plaques, chromatolysis of Nissl granules, TNF-Î±, nitrite and ROS levels in the hippocampus, phagocytic activity of splenic PMN and LAI of splenic MNC in AD rats showed greater changes in the 21- than in the 15-day study, and the recovery of these parameters after administration of naproxen differed between the two study durations. The present study shows that colchicine-induced neurodegeneration is time dependent and mediated by cyclooxygenase-induced neuroinflammation, which is reflected in the systemic immunological responses.

25072545	[Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease: from research to clinical practice and ethics].
Recenti Prog Med  2014 Jul-Aug
In 2011, the so-called Dubois criteria introduced the use of biomarkers in research (in particular, brain amyloid positron emission tomography imaging and the cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau/fosfo-tau and beta-amyloid 1-42) for the early or preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Even so, we are looking at an increased use of these markers in clinical practice. In the 1960s, Alzheimer's disease was considered a rare form of presenile dementia, but gradually it has been recognized as the prevalent form of old-age dementia. As a consequence, what was once regarded as an inevitable outcome of old age is now recognized as a true disease. Several factors contributed to this paradigm shift, in particular a longer lifespan, new techniques of in vivo study of the central nervous system, and the pressure exerted by the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups. The current lack of disease-modifying therapies and the high incidence of mild cognitive impairment, which is a risk factor for dementia, raise a series of clinical ethical problems ranging from how diagnosis is communicated to how resources are used. This article offers a conceptual scheme through which these issues can be addressed.  
24319654	White matter tract integrity metrics reflect the vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts in Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroimage Clin 20131109 2014
Post-mortem and imaging studies have observed that white matter (WM) degenerates in a pattern inverse to myelin development, suggesting preferential regional vulnerabilities influencing cognitive decline in AD. This study applied novel WM tract integrity (WMTI) metrics derived from diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) to examine WM tissue properties in AD within this framework. Using data from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, nÂ =Â 12), AD (nÂ =Â 14), and normal control (NC; nÂ =Â 15) subjects, mixed models revealed interaction effects: specific WMTI metrics of axonal density and myelin integrity (i.e. axonal water fraction, radial extra-axonal diffusivity) in late-myelinating tracts (i.e. superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi) changed in the course of disease, but were stable in the initial stages for early-myelinating tracts (i.e. posterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncles). WMTI metrics in late-myelinating tracts correlated with semantic verbal fluency, a cognitive function known to decline in AD. These findings corroborate the preferential vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts, and illustrate an application of WMTI metrics to characterizing the regional course of WM changes in AD.  
24487796	Clinicopathological outcomes of prospectively followed normal elderly brain bank volunteers.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Mar
Existing reports on the frequencies of neurodegenerative diseases are typically based on clinical diagnoses. We sought to determine these frequencies in a prospectively assessed, community-based autopsy series. Included subjects had normal cognitive and movement disorder assessments at study entry. Of the 119 cases meeting these criteria, 52% were women; the median age of study entry was 83.5 years (range, 67-99 years), and the median duration from the first visit until death was 4.3 years (range, 0-10 years). At autopsy, clinicopathological diagnoses were made in 30 cases (25%). These diagnoses included 20 with Alzheimer disease (AD) (17%), 7 with vascular dementia (6%), 4 with progressive supranuclear palsy (3%), 3 with Parkinson disease and 1 each with dementia with Lewy bodies, corticobasal degeneration, or multiple system atrophy (0.8% each). Of the 87 subjects still clinically normal at death (73%), 33 had extensive AD pathology (preclinical AD) (38%), 17 had incidental Lewy bodies (20%), and 4 had incidental pathology consistent with progressive supranuclear palsy (5%). The diagnoses were not mutually exclusive. Although limited by a relatively small sample size, the neuropathological outcome of these initially normal elderly subjects represents a rough estimate of the incidence of these neurodegenerative conditions over a defined time period.  
24621494	Amyloid burden, neuronal function, and cognitive decline in middle-aged adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
J Int Neuropsychol Soc 20140312 2014Apr
The relative influence of amyloid burden, neuronal structure and function, and prior cognitive performance on prospective memory decline among asymptomatic late middle-aged individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently unknown. We investigated this using longitudinal cognitive data from 122 middle-aged adults (21 "Decliners" and 101 "Stables") enrolled in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention who underwent multimodality neuroimaging [11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and structural/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)] 5.7 Â± 1.4 years (range = 2.9-8.9) after their baseline cognitive assessment. Covariate-adjusted regression analyses revealed that the only imaging measure that significantly distinguished Decliners from Stables (p = .027) was a Neuronal Function composite derived from FDG and fMRI. In contrast, several cognitive measures, especially those that tap episodic memory, significantly distinguished the groups (p's&lt;.05). Complementary receiver operating characteristic curve analyses identified the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) Total (.82 Â± .05, p &lt; .001), the BVMT-R Delayed Recall (.73 Â± .06, p = .001), and the Reading subtest from the Wide-Range Achievement Test-III (.72 Â± .06, p = .002) as the top three measures that best discriminated the groups. These findings suggest that early memory test performance might serve a more clinically pivotal role in forecasting future cognitive course than is currently presumed. 
24941200	Mechanisms of U87 astrocytoma cell uptake and trafficking of monomeric versus protofibril Alzheimer's disease amyloid-Î² proteins.
PLoS ONE 20140618 2014
A significant hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the formation of senile plaques in the brain due to the unbalanced levels of amyloid-beta (AÎ²). However, although how AÎ² is produced from amyloid precursor proteins is well understood, little is known regarding the clearance and metabolism of various AÎ² aggregates from the brain. Similarly, little is known regarding how astrocytes internalize and degrade AÎ², although astrocytes are known to play an important role in plaque maintenance and AÎ² clearance. The objective of this study is to investigate the cellular mechanisms that mediate the internalization of soluble monomeric versus oligomeric AÎ² by astrocytes. We used a combination of laser confocal microscopy and genetic and pharmacological experiments to dissect the internalization of sAÎ²42 and oAÎ²42 and their postendocytic transport by U87 human brain astrocytoma cell line. Both AÎ²42 species were internalized by U87 cells through fluid phase macropinocytosis, which required dynamin 2. Depleting LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) decreased sAÎ²42 uptake more significantly than that of oAÎ²42. We finally show that both AÎ²42 species were rapidly transported to lysosomes through an endolytic pathway and subjected to proteolysis after internalization, which had no significant toxic effects to the U87 cells under relatively low concentrations. We propose that macropinocytic sAÎ²42 and oAÎ²42 uptake and their subsequent proteolytic degradation in astroglial cells is a significant mechanism underlying AÎ² clearance from the extracellular milieu. Understanding the molecular events involved in astrocytic AÎ² internalization may identify potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease.  
24132829	Firing properties of entorhinal cortex neurons and early alterations in an Alzheimer's disease transgenic model.
Pflugers Arch. 20131017 2014Jul
The entorhinal cortex (EC) is divided into medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) anatomical areas, and layer II neurons of these two regions project to granule cells of the dentate gyrus through the medial and lateral perforant pathways (MPP and LPP), respectively. Stellate cells (SCs) represent the main neurons constituting the MPP inputs, while fan cells (FCs) represent the main LPP inputs. Here, we first characterized the excitability properties of SCs and FCs in adult wild-type (WT) mouse brain. Our data indicate that, during sustained depolarization, action potentials (APs) generated by SCs exhibit increased fast afterhyperpolarization and overshoot, making them able to fire at higher frequencies and to exhibit higher spike frequency adaptation (SFA) than FCs. Since the EC is one of the earliest brain regions affected during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, we compared SCs and FCs firing in 4-month-old WT and transgenic Tg2576 mice, a well-established AD mouse model. Tg2576-SCs displayed a slight increase in firing frequency during mild depolarization but otherwise normal excitability properties during higher stimulations. On the contrary, Tg2576-FCs exhibited a decreased firing frequency during mild and higher depolarizations, as well as an increased SFA. Our data identify the FCs as a neuronal population particularly sensitive to early pathological effects of chronic accumulation of APP-derived peptides, as it occurs in Tg2576 mice. As FCs represent the major input of sensory information to the hippocampus during memory acquisition, early alterations in their excitability profile could significantly contribute to the onset of cognitive decline in AD.  
24944190	Parallel discovery of Alzheimer's therapeutics.
Sci Transl Med  2014Jun18
As the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) grows, so do the costs it imposes on society. Scientific, clinical, and financial interests have focused current drug discovery efforts largely on the single biological pathway that leads to amyloid deposition. This effort has resulted in slow progress and disappointing outcomes. Here, we describe a "portfolio approach" in which multiple distinct drug development projects are undertaken simultaneously. Although a greater upfront investment is required, the probability of at least one success should be higher with "multiple shots on goal," increasing the efficiency of this undertaking. However, our portfolio simulations show that the risk-adjusted return on investment of parallel discovery is insufficient to attract private-sector funding. Nevertheless, the future cost savings of an effective AD therapy to Medicare and Medicaid far exceed this investment, suggesting that government funding is both essential and financially beneficial. 
24596271	Onset of hippocampus-dependent memory impairments in 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Hippocampus 20140314 2014Jul
The 5XFAD mice are an early-onset transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which amyloid plaques are first observed between two and four months of age in the cortical layer five and in the subiculum of the hippocampal formation. Although cognitive alterations have been described in these mice, there are no studies that focused on the onset of hippocampus-dependent memory deficits, which are a hallmark of the prodromal stage of AD. To identify when the first learning and memory impairments appear, 5XFAD mice of two, four, and six months of age were compared with their respective wild-type littermates using the olfactory tubing maze, which is a very sensitive hippocampal-dependent task. Deficits in learning and memory started at four months with a substantial increase at six months of age while no olfactory impairments were observed. The volumetric study using magnetic resonance imaging of the whole brain and specific areas (olfactory bulb, striatum, and hippocampus) did not reveal neuro-anatomical difference. Slight memory deficits appeared at 4 months of age in correlation with an increased astrogliosis and amyloid plaque formation. This early impairment in learning and memory related to the hippocampal dysfunction is particularly suited to assess preclinical therapeutic strategies aiming to delay or suppress the onset of AD. 
24956922	The heterogeneous course of depressive symptoms for the dementia caregiver.
Int J Aging Hum Dev  2014
Caregiving may be burdensome to caregivers, negatively affecting health and impacting decisions to institutionalize patients. It is unclear how caregiver depression changes over longer periods or whether heterogeneous trajectories for caregivers are apparent. The goals of this article are to characterize the course of depressive symptoms among caregivers over time and to examine the impact of baseline patient and caregiver characteristics on these trajectories. Patients with dementia and their caregivers were followed every 6 months for up to 6 years or until death (n = 133). Growth mixture modeling identified trajectories of caregiver depression over time. Most caregivers had stable trajectories of symptoms, with a smaller subset showing evidence of wear-and-tear. Patient clinical characteristics had no impact on symptom course for caregivers. Future work should utilize a longitudinal perspective and consider that there may be heterogeneous trajectories for caregivers. Those caregivers who follow a wear-and-tear trajectory may require targeted interventions to improve outcomes. 
25051175	Histone Acetyltransferase p300 Mediates Histone Acetylation of PS1 and BACE1 in a Cellular Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
PLoS ONE 20140722 2014
Epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have suggested that histone hypoacetylation may regulate the expression of genes associated with memory and learning in AD, little is known about histone regulation of AD-related genes such as Presenilin 1(PS1) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1). By utilizing neuroblastoma N2a cells transfected with Swedish mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (N2a/APPswe) and wild-type APP (N2a/APPwt) as cellular models of AD, we examined the alterations of histone acetylation at the promoter regions of PS1 and BACE1 in these cells. Our results revealed that histone H3 acetylation in PS1 and BACE1 promoters is markedly increased in N2a/APPswe cells when compared to N2a/APPwt cells and control cells (vector-transfected), respectively, causing the elevated expression of PS1 and BACE1. In addition, expression of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) adenoviral E1A-associated 300-kDa protein (p300) is dramatically enhanced in N2a/APPswe cells compared to N2a/APPwt and control cells. We have further demonstrated the direct binding of p300 protein to the PS1 and BACE1 promoters in N2a/APPswe cells. The expression levels of H3 acetylation of the PS1 and BACE1 promoters and p300 protein, however, were found to be not significantly different in N2a/APPwt cells when compared to controls in our studies. Furthermore, curcumin, a natural selective inhibitor of p300 in HATs, significantly suppressed the expression of PS1 and BACE1 through inhibition of H3 acetylation in their promoter regions in N2a/APPswe cells. These findings indicated that histone acetyltransferase p300 plays a critical role in controlling the expression of AD-related genes through regulating the acetylation of their promoter regions, suggesting that p300 may represent a novel potential therapeutic target for AD.  
25051234	Intracellular clusterin interacts with brain isoforms of the bridging integrator 1 and with the microtubule-associated protein tau in Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140722 2014
Sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to affect 50% of individuals reaching 85 years of age. The most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the e4 allele of APOE gene encoding apolipoprotein E, a lipid carrier shown to modulate brain amyloid burden. Recent genome-wide association studies have uncovered additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to AD susceptibility, including those in the CLU and BIN1 genes encoding for clusterin (CLU) and the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) proteins, respectively. Because CLU has been implicated in brain amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) clearance in mouse models of amyloid deposition, we sought to investigate whether an AD-linked SNP in the CLU gene altered AÎ²42 biomarker levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Instead, we found that the CLU rs11136000 SNP modified CSF levels of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in AD patients. We also found that an intracellular form of CLU (iCLU) was upregulated in the brain of Tau overexpressing Tg4510 mice, but not in Tg2576 amyloid mouse model. By overexpressing iCLU and Tau in cell culture systems we discovered that iCLU was a Tau-interacting protein and that iCLU associated with brain-specific isoforms of BIN1, also recently identified as a Tau-binding protein. Through expression analysis of CLU and BIN1 variants, we found that CLU and BIN1 interacted via their coiled-coil motifs. In co-immunoprecipitation studies using human brain tissue, we showed that iCLU and the major BIN1 isoform expressed in neurons were associated with modified Tau species found in AD. Finally, we showed that expression of certain coding CLU variants linked to AD risk led to increased levels of iCLU. Together, our findings suggest that iCLU and BIN1 interaction might impact Tau function in neurons and uncover potential new mechanisms underlying the etiology of Tau pathology in AD.  
24685624	Regional cortical thinning and cerebrospinal biomarkers predict worsening daily functioning across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) heralds the transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia and is a major source of burden for both the patient and caregiver. To investigate the relationship between IADL and regional cortical thinning and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers cross-sectionally and longitudinally in clinically normal (CN) elderly, MCI, and mild AD dementia subjects. Two hundred and twenty nine CN, 395 MCI, and 188 AD dementia subjects participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent baseline magnetic resonance imaging, baseline lumbar puncture, and clinical assessments, including the Functional Activities Questionnaire used to measure IADL, every 6 to 12 months up to 3 years. General linear regression and mixed effects models were employed. IADL impairment was associated with the interactions between lower inferior temporal cortical thickness and diagnosis (p &lt; 0.0001), greater lateral occipital cortical thickness and diagnosis (p &lt; 0.0001), and greater amyloid-Î² 1-42 (AÎ²1-42) and diagnosis (p = 0.0002) at baseline (driven by AD dementia). Lower baseline supramarginal (p = 0.02) and inferior temporal (p = 0.05) cortical thickness, lower AÎ²1-42 (p &lt; 0.0001), and greater total tau (t-tau) (p = 0.02) were associated with greater rate of IADL impairment over time. Temporal atrophy is associated with IADL impairment in mild AD dementia at baseline, while baseline parietal and temporal atrophy, lower CSF AÎ²1-42, and greater t-tau predict worsening IADL impairment over time across the AD spectrum. These results emphasize the importance of assessing IADL at the stage of MCI and even at the transition from CN to MCI. 
24685626	Neuroanatomical correlates of emotional blunting in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Emotional blunting is a characteristic feature of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and can help discriminate between patients with bvFTD and other forms of younger-onset dementia. We compared the presence of emotional blunting symptoms in patients with bvFTD and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), and investigated the neuroanatomical associations between emotional blunting and regional brain volume. Twenty-five individuals with bvFTD (n = 11) and early-onset AD (n = 14) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were rated on symptoms of emotional blunting using the Scale for Emotional Blunting (SEB). The two groups were compared on SEB ratings and MRI-derived brain volume using tensor-based morphometry. Voxel-wise linear regression was performed to determine neuroanatomical correlates of SEB scores. The bvFTD group had significantly higher SEB scores compared to the AD group. On MRI, bvFTD patients had smaller bilateral frontal lobe volume compared to AD patients, while AD patients had smaller bilateral temporal and left parietal volume than bvFTD patients. In bvFTD, SEB ratings were strongly correlated with right anterior temporal volume, while the association between SEB and the right orbitofrontal cortex was non-significant. Symptoms of emotional blunting were more prevalent in bvFTD than early-onset AD patients. These symptoms were particularly associated with right-sided atrophy, with significant involvement of the right anterior temporal region. Based on these findings, the SEB appears to measure symptoms of emotional blunting that are localized to the right anterior temporal lobe. 
25061569	AÎ² and tau toxicities in Alzheimer's are linked via oxidative stress-induced p38 activation: protective role of vitamin E.
Redox Biol 20140310 2014
Oxidative stress is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose that rather than causing damage because of the action of free radicals, oxidative stress deranges signaling pathways leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, a hallmark of the disease. Indeed, incubation of neurons in culture with 5 ÂµM beta-amyloid peptide (AÎ²) causes an activation of p38 MAPK (p38) that leads to tau hyperphosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 prevents AÎ²-induced tau phosphorylation. AÎ²-induced effects are prevented when neurons are co-incubated with trolox (the water-soluble analog of vitamin E). We have confirmed these results in vivo, in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice of AD. We have found that APP/PS1 transgenic mice exhibit a high level of P-p38 in the hippocampus but not in cortex and this is prevented by feeding animals with a diet supplemented with vitamin E. Our results underpin the role of oxidative stress in the altered cell signaling in AD pathology and suggest that antioxidant prevention may be useful in AD therapeutics. 
24936870	Repair of oxidative DNA damage, cell-cycle regulation and neuronal death may influence the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140617 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline associated with a featured neuropathology (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). Several studies have implicated oxidative damage to DNA, DNA repair, and altered cell-cycle regulation in addition to cell death in AD post-mitotic neurons. However, there is a lack of studies that systematically assess those biological processes in patients with AD neuropathology but with no evidence of cognitive impairment. We evaluated markers of oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG, H2AX), DNA repair (p53, BRCA1, PTEN), and cell-cycle (Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdk5, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, p27Kip1, phospho-Rb and E2F1) through immunohistochemistry and cell death through TUNEL in autopsy hippocampal tissue samples arrayed in a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of three groups: I) "clinical-pathological AD" (CP-AD)--subjects with neuropathological AD (Braak â‰¥ IV and CERAD = B or C) and clinical dementia (CDR â‰¥ 2, IQCODE&gt;3.8); II) "pathological AD" (P-AD)--subjects with neuropathological AD (Braak â‰¥ IV and CERAD = B or C) and without cognitive impairment (CDR 0, IQCODE&lt;3.2); and III) "normal aging" (N)--subjects without neuropathological AD (Braak â‰¤ II and CERAD 0 or A) and with normal cognitive function (CDR 0, IQCODE&lt;3.2). Our results show that high levels of oxidative DNA damage are present in all groups. However, significant reductions in DNA repair and cell-cycle inhibition markers and increases in cell-cycle progression and cell death markers in subjects with CP-AD were detected when compared to both P-AD and N groups, whereas there were no significant differences in the studied markers between P-AD individuals and N subjects. This study indicates that, even in the setting of pathological AD, healthy cognition may be associated with a preserved repair to DNA damage, cell-cycle regulation, and cell death in post-mitotic neurons. 
24325271	7,8-dihydroxyflavone ameliorates scopolamine-induced Alzheimer-like pathologic dysfunction.
Rejuvenation Res  2014Jun
Scopolamine (Sco) can induce amyloid Î² (AÎ²) deposition, oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and learning/memory impairment as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia affecting more than 25 million elderly people worldwide. Herein we explored the protective effect of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) on Sco-induced AÎ² deposition, oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and learning/memory defects. Rats were randomly divided into four groups (n=12 for each group). The control group received normal saline (NS); the Sco group received Sco (1â€‰mg/kg per day) intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 2 weeks. Mice in the Sco+7,8-DHF group received 1â€‰mg/kg per day 7,8-DHF i.p. for 2 weeks, followed by Sco (1â€‰mg/kg per day)+1â€‰mg/kg per day 7,8-DHF (i.p.) for another 2 weeks. The 7,8-DHF group received 1â€‰mg/kg per day 7,8-DHF (i.p.) for 4 weeks. Results showed that the supplement of 7,8-DHF significantly reversed AÎ² deposition, oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive defects. Our data suggest that 7,8-DHF might serve as a promising therapeutic candidate for attenuating Sco-induced AD-like pathological dysfuntion. 
24685632	Cognitive, genetic, and brain perfusion factors associated with four year incidence of Alzheimer's disease from mild cognitive impairment.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
There is a range of factors that predict the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia among patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To identify the neuropsychological, genetic, and functional brain imaging data that best predict conversion to AD dementia in patients with amnestic MCI. From an initial group of 42 amnestic MCI patients assessed with neurological, neuropsychological, and brain SPECT, 39 (25 converters, 14 non-converters) were followed for 4 years, and 36 had APOE Îµ4 genotyping. Baseline neuropsychological data and brain SPECT data were used to predict which of the MCI patients would develop dementia by the end of the 4 years of observation. The MCI patients who had converted to AD dementia had poorer performance on long-term visual memory and Semantic Fluency tests. The MCI subjects who developed dementia were more likely to carry at least one copy of the APOE Îµ4 allele (Hazard Risk = 4.22). There was lower brain perfusion in converters than non-converters, mainly in postcentral gyrus. An additional analysis of the SPECT data found differences between the MCI subjects and controls in the posterior cingulate gyrus and the basal forebrain. When the brain imaging and neuropsychological test data were combined in the same Cox regression model, only the neuropsychological test data were significantly associated with time to dementia. Although the presence of reduced brain perfusion in postcentral gyrus and basal forebrain indicated an at-risk condition, it was the extent of memory impairment that was linked to the speed of decline from MCI to AD. 
25069266	[Role of apolipoprotein E in the molecular pathomechanism of Alzheimer disease].
Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi  2014Feb
Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) is a major cholesterol carrier regulating lipid transport and injury repair in the brain. It is known that individuals carrying the epsilon4 allele are at increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) compared with those carrying the more common epsilon3 allele, whereas the epsilon2 allele decreases risk. ApoE-HDL binds to several cell-surface receptors to deliver lipids, and also to amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins. Abeta is thought to initiate toxic events that lead to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD. It has been shown that Apo-E isoforms differentially regulate Abeta aggregation and clearance in the brain, and have distinct functions in regulating brain lipid transport, and mitochondrial function. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about Apo-E in the CNS, with a particular emphasis on its functions to generate HDL and clear/degradate of HDL-bound Abeta with different ApoE isoforms. 
24641683	Accelerated microglial pathology is associated with AÎ² plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Aging Cell 20140318 2014Aug
Microglia integrate within the neural tissue with a distinct ramified morphology through which they scan the surrounding neuronal network. Here, we used a digital tool for the quantitative morphometric characterization of fine cortical microglial structures in mice, and the changes they undergo with aging and in Alzheimer's-like disease. We show that, compared with microglia in young mice, microglia in old mice are less ramified and possess fewer branches and fine processes along with a slightly increased proinflammatory cytokine expression. A similar microglial pathology appeared 6-12Â months earlier in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with a significant increase in brain parenchyma lacking coverage by microglial processes. We further demonstrate that microglia near amyloid plaques acquire unique activated phenotypes with impaired process complexity. We thus show that along with a chronic proinflammatory reaction in the brain, aging causes a significant reduction in the capacity of microglia to scan their environment. This type of pathology is markedly accelerated in mouse models of AD, resulting in a severe microglial process deficiency, and possibly contributing to enhanced cognitive decline.  
24604080	Tauopathy contributes to synaptic and cognitive deficits in a murine model for Alzheimer's disease.
FASEB J. 20140306 2014Jun
Tau alterations are now considered an executor of neuronal demise and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mouse models combining amyloidosis and tauopathy and their parental counterparts are important tools to further investigate the interplay of abnormal amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and Tau species in pathogenesis, synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Here, we crossed APP/PS1 mice with 5 early-onset familial AD mutations (5xFAD) and TauP301S (PS19) transgenic mice, denoted F(+)/T(+) mice, and phenotypically compared them to their respective parental strains, denoted F(+)/T(-) and F(-)/T(+) respectively, as controls. We found dramatically aggravated tauopathy (âˆ¼10-fold) in F(+)/T(+) mice compared to the parental F(-)/T(+) mice. In contrast, amyloidosis was unaltered compared to the parental F(+)/T(-) mice. Tauopathy was invariably and very robustly aggravated in hippocampal and cortical brain regions. Most important, F(+)/T(+) displayed aggravated cognitive deficits in a hippocampus-dependent spatial navigation task, compared to the parental F(+)/T(-) strain, while parental F(-)/T(+) mice did not display cognitive impairment. Basal synaptic transmission was impaired in F(+)/T(+) mice compared to nontransgenic mice and the parental strains (â‰¥40%). Finally, F(+)/T(+) mice displayed a significant hippocampal atrophy (âˆ¼20%) compared to nontransgenic mice, in contrast to the parental strains. Our data indicate for the first time that pathological AÎ² species (or APP/PS1) induced changes in Tau contribute to cognitive deficits correlating with synaptic deficits and hippocampal atrophy in an AD model. Our data lend support to the amyloid cascade hypothesis with a role of pathological AÎ² species as initiator and pathological Tau species as executor.-Stancu, I.-C., Ris, L., Vasconcelos, B., Marinangeli, C., Goeminne, L., Laporte, V., Haylani, L. E., Couturier, J., Schakman, O., Gailly, P., Pierrot, N., Kienlen-Campard, P., Octave, J.-N., Dewachter, I. Tauopathy contributes to synaptic and cognitive deficits in a murine model for Alzheimer's disease.  
24568209	The effect of chair yoga in older adults with moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease.
Res Gerontol Nurs 20140226 2014Jul
Using a quasi-experimental single-group design, this study examined the feasibility of older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia to complete the Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga Program. Physical function of participants who completed the program was measured. The nine older adults with AD (mean age = 83) participated in the 8-week Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga Program. To measure physical function, the Six-Minute Walk Test, the Gait Speed Test, and the Berg Balance Scale were administered at pre-intervention, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 month after program completion. All participants completed the program. Positive changes were seen across all physical measures. Further study, using a larger sample and including a control group, is needed to fully determine the effect of the Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga Program on older adults with moderate to severe AD.

24099155	New insights into the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in Alzheimer's disease.
Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 20131008 2014Jan
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is recognized as a crucial player in many cellular functions and its activity is tightly controlled by complex mechanisms that are each dependent upon specific signaling pathways. Furthermore, GSK-3 dysfunction has been linked to a number of pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, the involvement of GSK-3 in several key pathophysiological pathways leading to AD and neurodegenerative diseases has placed this enzyme in a central position in this disorder. This article offers a review of the relationship between GSK-3 and AD with a special focus on recent evidence showing a key role of GSK-3 activity in modulating cellular pathways controlling amyloid formation, especially through the control of Î²-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 gene expression, as well as its role as a key regulator of neurogenesis. GSK-3 appears to be a cellular nexus, integrating several signaling systems, including several second messengers and a wide selection of cellular stimulants. The next few years will certainly bring us further insights into the cellular functions of this fascinating enzyme and its potential as a therapeutic target in AD and other neurological disorders. 
24575399	The impact of cholesterol, DHA, and sphingolipids on Alzheimer's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140219 2013
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting over 35 million people worldwide. Pathological hallmarks of AD are massive amyloidosis, extracellular senile plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles accompanied by an excessive loss of synapses. Major constituents of senile plaques are 40-42 amino acid long peptides termed Î² -amyloid (A Î² ). A Î² is produced by sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP processing and A Î² production have been one of the central scopes in AD research in the past. In the last years, lipids and lipid-related issues are more frequently discussed to contribute to the AD pathogenesis. This review summarizes lipid alterations found in AD postmortem brains, AD transgenic mouse models, and the current understanding of how lipids influence the molecular mechanisms leading to AD and A Î² generation, focusing especially on cholesterol, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and sphingolipids/glycosphingolipids.  
24670762	REST and stress resistance in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.
Nature 20140319 2014Mar27
Human neurons are functional over an entire lifetime, yet the mechanisms that preserve function and protect against neurodegeneration during ageing are unknown. Here we show that induction of the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST; also known as neuron-restrictive silencer factor, NRSF) is a universal feature of normal ageing in human cortical and hippocampal neurons. REST is lost, however, in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing and expression analysis show that REST represses genes that promote cell death and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and induces the expression of stress response genes. Moreover, REST potently protects neurons from oxidative stress and amyloid Î²-protein toxicity, and conditional deletion of REST in the mouse brain leads to age-related neurodegeneration. A functional orthologue of REST, Caenorhabditis elegans SPR-4, also protects against oxidative stress and amyloid Î²-protein toxicity. During normal ageing, REST is induced in part by cell non-autonomous Wnt signalling. However, in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, REST is lost from the nucleus and appears in autophagosomes together with pathological misfolded proteins. Finally, REST levels during ageing are closely correlated with cognitive preservation and longevity. Thus, the activation state of REST may distinguish neuroprotection from neurodegeneration in the ageing brain.  
24727450	Secreted type of amyloid precursor protein induces glial differentiation by stimulating the BMP/Smad signaling pathway.
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 20140413 2014May9
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases leading to dementia. Although cytotoxicity of amyloid Î² peptides has been intensively studied within pathophysiology of AD, the physiological function of amyloid precursor protein (APP) still remains unclarified. We have shown previously that secreted APPÎ± (sAPPÎ±) is associated with glial differentiation of neural stem cells. To elucidate specific mechanisms underlying sAPPÎ±-induced gliogenesis, we examined the potential involvement of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). BMPs are one of the factors involved in glial differentiation of neural progenitor cells. When expressions of BMP-2, -4, and -7 were examined, upregulation of BMP-4 expression was solely observed as a result of treatment with sAPPÎ± in a time and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the treatment of sAPPÎ± promoted phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, a downstream signaling mediator of BMP receptors. Interestingly, N-terminal domain of APP (1-205) was sufficient to elevate BMP4 expression, resulting in an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression and phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. However, the application of APP neutralizing antibody and anti-BMP4 antibody significantly suppressed expression of BMP-4 as well as phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. Thus, our results indicate that sAPPÎ±-induced gliogenesis is in part mediated by the BMP-4 signaling pathway. We also observed upregulation of BMP-4 and phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in APP transgenic mice. It is imperative to unravel the mechanisms underlying the role of BMP-4 during APPÎ±-induced glial differentiation in hope of providing novel prevention or treatment for AD. 
24735533	Taurine attenuates amyloid Î² 1-42-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by activating of SIRT1 in SK-N-SH cells.
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 20140413 2014May9
Amyloid Î² (AÎ²) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Studies indicate that AÎ² causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial dysfunction and neurons loss in vivo and in vitro. Taurine, a naturally occurring Î²-amino acid in the brain, has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective properties. In the present study, the effects of taurine on cell viability and mitochondrial function in AÎ²1-42-treated SK-N-SH cells were investigated. Pretreatment of taurine significantly attenuated AÎ²1-42-induced neuronal death. Similarly, taurine suppressed the mPTP opening and reversed mitochondrial function in the presence of AÎ²1-42. Additionally, taurine attenuated the intracellular Ca(2+) and ROS generation induced by AÎ²1-42. Moreover, the expression of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was obviously recovered by taurine in AÎ²1-42-treated SK-N-SH cells. Our results suggest that taurine prevents AÎ²1-42-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by activation of SIRT1. This study implies that taurine is a prospective additive for AD patients. 
24928006	[Study of mutations of presenilin 1 gene in early-onset familial Alzheimers disease].
Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi  2014Jun
Mutations of presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene are the most frequent cause for familial Alzheimers disease (AD). This study was set to explore potential mutation of PSEN1 gene in a Chinese family featuring early-onset Alzheimers disease (FAD). DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples from 17 members of the FAD family as well as 10 patients with sporadic Alzheimers disease and 100 healthy subjects. With polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing, exons 113 of the PSEN1 gene were analyzed. DNA sequencing has revealed a heterozygous point mutation from G to A at position 1133 (Gly378Glu) of exon 11 of PSEN1 gene in 6 members from the family, among whom 5 were patients with dementia, whilst the remaining 1 was clinically normal but under onset age. The same mutation was not found in all other patients and the normal controls. A novel missense mutation of the PSEN1 gene, Gly378Glu, probably underlies the autosomal dominant early-onset FAD in this Chinese family. 
24635844	A review of the effects of hypoxia, sleep deprivation and transcranial magnetic stimulation on EEG activity in humans: challenges for drug discovery for Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
Different kinds of challenge can alter cognitive process and electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in humans. This can provide an alternative paradigms to evaluate treatment effects in drug discovery. Here, we report recent findings on the effects of challenges represented by sleep deprivation (SD), transient hypoxia, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy volunteers on cognitive processes and EEG rhythms to build a knowledge platform for novel research for drug discovery in AD Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep pressure enhanced frontal delta rhythms (&lt; 4 Hz) during the night, while SD increased slow rhythms in the theta range (4-7 Hz), and reduced resting state alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) after the following day. Furthermore, SD transiently affected cognitive performance. In contrast, transient experimental hypoxia induced abnormal posterior resting state delta and alpha rhythms in healthy volunteers that resemble the abnormal EEG rhythms typically recorded in AD patients. However, the relationship between the cognitive and EEG effects of such challenges is poorly understood. TMS reversibly interfered with higher brain functions during EEG recordings, but few studies have investigated the relationship between the cognitive and EEG effects of TMS. In conclusion, SD is the most mature challenge model for testing new drugs for AD. Future investigation is needed to better understand the opportunities offered by TMS and hypoxia challenges.  
24801218	A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the PDE9A inhibitor, PF-04447943, in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
PF-04447943 is a potent, selective phosphodiesterase 9A (PDE9A) inhibitor that elevates guanoscine 3',5' - cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. PDE9A inhibition enhances synaptic plasticity and improves memory in preclinical cognition models, and prevents decreases in dendritic spine density in transgenic mice that overexpress amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to high levels of amyloid beta (AÎ²) production (Tg2576). This Phase 2 multicenter study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of PF-04447943 compared with placebo in mild to moderate probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects in overall good health with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 14-26 were randomized to 12 weeks treatment with PF-04447943 25 mg q12h (n=91) or placebo (n=100). Concomitant acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine use was excluded. The primary outcome was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) and standard safety measures were secondary outcomes. Completion rates were similar, 87% PF-04447943 vs 92% placebo. At week 12 the mean (SE) baseline adjusted decrease from baseline in ADAS cog for PF-04447943-treated patients was -1.91 (0.54). Placebo treated patients had a change of -1.60 (0.50). The difference between treatments was -0.31 (90% CI of -1.52, 0.90). Corresponding values for the NPI were -2.86 (0.72) vs -2.70 (0.67) with a treatment difference of -0.16 (90% CI of -1.78, 1.48). Neither these changes nor the distribution of CGI-I scores were statistically significantly different between groups. The incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was similar between groups with 2 deaths in the placebo group. The PF-04447943 group reported more gastrointestinal AEs including diarrhea (5.5% vs 3%) and nausea (5.5% vs 1%) and had a higher rate of discontinuation due to AEs (6.6% vs 2%). Although generally safe and well-tolerated, 12 weeks PF-04447943 treatment did not improve cognition, behavior, and global change compared with placebo. 
24893886	The normal and pathologic roles of the Alzheimer's Î²-secretase, BACE1.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
As the most common neurodegenerative disease, therapeutic avenues for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's Disease are highly sought after. The aspartic protease BACE1 is the initiator enzyme for the formation of AÎ², a major constituent of amyloid plaques that represent one of the hallmark pathological features of this disorder. Thus, targeting BACE1 for disease-modifying AD therapies represents a rationale approach. The collective knowledge acquired from investigations of BACE1 deletion mutants and characterization of BACE1 substrates has downstream significance not only for the discovery of AD drug therapies but also for predicting side effects of BACE1 inhibition. Here we discuss the identification and validation of BACE1 as the Î²-secretase implicated in AD, in addition to information regarding BACE1 cell biology, localization, substrates and potential physiological functions derived from BACE1 knockout models.  
24719207	Epigenetic memory: the Lamarckian brain.
EMBO J. 20140409 2014May2
Recent data support the view that epigenetic processes play a role in memory consolidation and help to transmit acquired memories even across generations in a Lamarckian manner. Drugs that target the epigenetic machinery were found to enhance memory function in rodents and ameliorate disease phenotypes in models for brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Chorea Huntington, Depression or Schizophrenia. In this review, I will give an overview on the current knowledge of epigenetic processes in memory function and brain disease with a focus on Morbus Alzheimer as the most common neurodegenerative disease. I will address the question whether an epigenetic therapy could indeed be a suitable therapeutic avenue to treat brain diseases and discuss the necessary steps that should help to take neuroepigenetic research to the next level.  
24720730	The coexistence of an equal amount of Alzheimer's amyloid-Î² 40 and 42 forms structurally stable and toxic oligomers through a distinct pathway.
FEBS J. 20140506 2014Jun
Fibrillar amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) is the major constituent of senile plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AÎ² is a short peptide generated from amyloid precursor protein with two main isoforms, AÎ²40 and AÎ²42, with the latter having two additional hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus. The two isoforms have distinct characteristics, in which AÎ²42 plays a more pathogenic role. Some early-onset familial AD cases possess an elevated AÎ²42/AÎ²40 level, and biochemical studies show the two species interact with each other. Therefore, understanding structural conversion in the aggregation of mixed AÎ² isoforms is essential for elucidating AD pathogenesis. Here, we systematically examined the differences between AÎ²42, AÎ²40 and various AÎ²42/AÎ²40 mixtures by monitoring the fibrillization kinetics, epitope changes, assembly, morphology and induced cytotoxicity. We found that the minor AÎ² species in different mixing ratios modulated the major aggregation pathway. Size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism spectroscopy and photo-crosslinking assay showed that soluble AÎ²42 oligomers were stabilized after AÎ²40 addition, and the equimolar AÎ²42/AÎ²40 mixture rapidly formed spherical oligomers. These oligomers were the most toxic among those examined as evidenced by neurite degeneration and neuronal toxicity. However, the oligomers were not responsible for intracellular calcium elevation. Overall, our results demonstrated that differently mixed AÎ² species repartitioned oligomer intermediates on the major aggregation pathway. Furthermore, the equimolar mixture rapidly formed structurally stable and the most toxic oligomers. These results provided information on the potential pathological mechanisms underlying the elevated AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio in familial AD patients and in the local environment of sporadic AD brains. 
24893329	Targeted quantitative analysis of synaptic proteins in Alzheimer's disease brain.
Neurochem. Int. 20140602 2014Sep
Brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients shows significant loss of synapses in selected regions. Synaptic degeneration is the best predictor for loss of cognitive functions ante mortem. The molecular mechanisms underlying this degeneration remain unknown. Our previous two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis proteomics study found that 26 synaptic proteins are differentially expressed in Alzheimer's brain. It is difficult to quantify global protein expression using this technique because (a) several proteins can migrate together and (b) isoforms of the same protein can migrate to different places. The present study estimated global synaptic protein levels by label-free multiple reaction monitoring. Multiple reaction monitoring is a powerful and sensitive mass spectrometry technique that specifically targets multiple protein of interests. The severely AD-affected hippocampus was compared with motor cortex, a relatively spared region. We targeted ten proteins in autopsy brain based on the earlier study. Analytes separated by high performance liquid-chromatography were monitored on a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode. With the use of an internal standard protein, linear and highly reproducible (CV&lt;9%) label-free assays were achieved. Data were contrasted with the gel-based study to highlight differences and similarities. Significantly higher expression levels of peroxiredoxin-1 (may provide antioxidant protection) and dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-1 (associated with cytoskeletal remodeling) were found in AD hippocampus. Significantly lower levels of peroxiredoxin-1 and the energy-related enzymes creatine kinase B and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C were found in non-AD hippocampus. Our previously reported difference in synaptotagmin expression is probably isoform-specific. These findings suggest potential roles of key proteins in synaptic loss in AD, and/or a protective mechanism in non-AD brain tissue.  
24931274	Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel radioiodinated imidazopyridine derivatives for amyloid-Î² imaging in Alzheimer's disease.
Bioorg. Med. Chem. 20140602 2014Aug1
Non-invasive detection for amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) deposition has important significance for the early diagnosis and medical intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we developed a series of imidazopyridine derivatives as potential imaging agents for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Two of them, compounds DRK092 and DRM106, showed higher affinity for synthetic human AÎ² 1-40 fibrils than did the well-known amyloid-imaging agent IMPY. A metabolite analysis revealed brain-permeable radioactive metabolites of (125)I-labeled DRK092 and IMPY; no radioactive metabolites from (125)I-labeled DRM106 ([(125)I]DRM106) were detected. In addition, in vitro autoradiography clearly demonstrated specific binding of [(125)I]DRM106 in the hippocampal region of AD enriched with AÎ² plaques. Thus, our results strongly suggested that compound DRM106 can be used as an imaging agent for SPECT to detect AÎ² deposition in AD brain.  
25026432	The effect of neuropeptide Y on cell survival and neurotrophin expression in in-vitro models of Alzheimer's disease.
Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 20140613 2014Aug
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormally folded protein fragments in neurons, i.e., Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) and tau protein, leading to cell death. Several neuropeptides present in the central nervous system (CNS) are believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Among them, neuropeptide Y (NPY), a small peptide widely distributed throughout the brain, has generated interest because of its role in neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in animal models of AD. In addition, it has been shown that NPY modulates neurogenesis. Interestingly, these latter effects are similar to those elicited by neurotrophins, which are critical molecules for the function and survival of neurons that degenerate during the course of AD. In this review we summarize the evidence for the involvement of NPY and neurotrophins in AD pathogenesis, and the similarity between them in CNS neurons. Finally, we recapitulate our recent in-vitro evidence for the involvement of neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the neuroprotective effect elicited by NPY in AD neuron-like models (neuroblastoma cells or primary cultures exposed to toxic concentrations of AÎ²'s pathogenic fragment 25-35), and propose a putative mechanism based on NPY-induced inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) influx in pre- and post-synaptic neurons.  
24780092	Early-onset Alzheimer's disease: a global cross-sectional analysis.
Eur. J. Neurol. 20140430 2014Sep
Little is known about factors associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), which occurs before 65Â years of age. The identification of factors of EOAD might provide insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Data from over 3000 subjects with AD from C-Path Online Data Repository were used to compare demographics, comorbidities and prescribed medications between EOAD and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The generalized estimating equations binomial model was used to identify factors associated with EOAD, allowing for within-trials correlation (multiple patients from one single trial). Despite the similar proportions in White, Asian and Black between EOAD and LOAD, a significantly higher proportion of EOAD population was from other races: Native American Indian, Alaskan and Hawaiian and other minorities (including Hispanics) (PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001); and were more likely to have anxiety or depression (PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). A high proportion of the LOAD population reported a history of AD from any relative (70% vs. 58%); atrial fibrillation, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, hypercholesterolaemia and hypothyroidism were over-represented in LOAD (PÂ &lt;Â 0.01). LOAD patients used more risperidone and donepezil (PÂ &lt;Â 0.01). The multivariable model results showed that, compared with LOAD, EOAD patients were more frequently from other races and were more likely to have anxiety or depression, with less hypertension, stroke and atrial fibrillation. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease is found more frequently in Native American Indians, Alaskans, Hawaiians and other minorities, including Hispanics; patients with EOAD have more anxiety or depression. EOAD occurs independently of hypertension, stroke and atrial fibrillation. 
23992204	Detecting signs of dysphagia in patients with Alzheimer's disease with oral feeding in daily life.
Geriatr Gerontol Int 20130829 2014Jul
It is important to understand dysphagia in patients with dementia, as it is associated with malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia. Particularly in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mortality from pneumonia is high and accounts for 70% of the causes of death. However, the standard swallowing tests are often difficult to use for patients with dementia, and methods to assess daily swallowing function are required. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to identify signs of dysphagia in AD patients in daily life. A total of 155 AD patients underwent evaluation of their swallowing function (modified water swallowing test), oral status (residual teeth, occlusal contacts), oral functions (lips function, tongue function, rinsing and gargling ability), vital functions (Barthel Index, Vitality Index), nutritional status (serum albumin, body mass index), cognitive function and neurological signs (Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, limb contractures), and diet-related assessments (storing food in the mouth, stuffing food into the mouth, appetite, caloric intake). The severity of AD was significantly associated with swallowing function (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). According to logistic regression analysis, the factor most significantly associated with dysphagia was "rinsing ability" (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.9-12.1). The factors that affect swallowing function in AD patients were examined. The swallowing function of severe AD patients was poor, and an association between AD and dysphagia was shown. Defective rinsing ability was identified as a risk factor for dysphagia. Therefore, observation of daily rinsing ability appears to be useful to identify signs of dysphagia in AD patients.

24020590	Serum levels of albumin-amyloid beta complexes are decreased in Alzheimer's disease.
Geriatr Gerontol Int 20130911 2014Jul
Decreased amyloid Î² (AÎ²) clearance from the brain to blood might play a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AÎ² is normally bound to and transported by albumin in blood, thus possibly maintaining constant concentration of free AÎ² in the blood. We therefore hypothesized that decreased blood levels of albumin-AÎ² complexes could be associated with decreased AÎ² removal from the brain to blood, resulting in AÎ² accumulation in the brain. We carried out a cross-sectional investigation of the association between serum levels of albumin-AÎ² complexes (SLAAC) and AD prevalence in 89 patients who visited our outpatient clinic, and gave written informed consent between August 2008 and May 2012. We confirmed 45 cases of AD. Low SLAAC was associated with an increased prevalence of AD (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14-0.51) in a univariable logistic model and multivariable logistic models. In addition, decreased SLAAC was associated with decreased levels of AÎ²42 in CSF (râ€‰=â€‰0.38, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0221) and increased levels of p-tau in CSF (râ€‰=â€‰-0.43, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0090), findings that have been shown to be associated with AD progression. This novel method might be very useful for monitoring of the progression of AD. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2014; 14: 716-723. 
24118908	Clinical characteristics according to depression screening tools in patients with Alzheimer's disease: View from self, caregiver-reported and drug-intervention pattern.
Geriatr Gerontol Int 20130930 2014Jul
Depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has different clinical manifestations from primary depression of non-demented patients. We designed the present study to explore the following: (i) to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with and without depression according to observational and subjective depression screening scale; and (ii) to examine the depression prevalence rate in patients with AD according to these criteria. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS, observational scale) and Neuropsychiatry Inventory Depression subscale (NPI-D; subjective scale) were administered to 257 patients with drug-naÃ¯ve probable AD. The study groups were classified into the three subgroups of "no-depression", GDS depression and NPI-DS (NPI-D significant) depression group, and the clinical characteristics of these subgroups were examined. The NPI-DS depression group showed lower scores on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination compared with the no-depression group, and higher NPI subdomain scores compared with other groups. The GDS depression group showed higher NPI motor subdomain scores compared with the no-depression group. Depression defined by NPI-DS was the least frequent (10.5%), and NPI-DA (NPI-D any) was the most frequent (56.4%). The prevalence of depression defined by GDS and anti-depressant usage was 30.0% and 16.0% each. The level of agreement between the screening tools determined through the kappa index was from low to moderate. The present study showed that different depression screening tools revealed a different prevalence and poor concordance rate among depression screening tools. Considering lower cognitive functions and higher BPSD symptoms in the NPI-DS depression group, NPI-DS could be associated with disease severity in AD patients. However, the clinical significance of GDS remains uncertain. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2014; 14: 660-666. 
24971794	Screening and identification of neuroprotective compounds relevant to Alzheimer×³s disease from medicinal plants of S. TomÃ© e PrÃ­ncipe.
J Ethnopharmacol 20140624 2014Aug8
Alzheimer×³s disease (AD) neuropathology is strongly associated with the activation of inflammatory pathways, and long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs reduces the risk of developing the disease. In S. TomÃ© e PrÃ­ncipe (STP), several medicinal plants are used both for their positive effects in the nervous system (treatment of mental disorders, analgesics) and their anti-inflammatory properties. The goal of this study was to determine whether a phenotypic, cell-based screening approach can be applied to selected plants from STP (Voacanga africana, Tarenna nitiduloides, Sacosperma paniculatum, Psychotria principensis, Psychotria subobliqua) in order to identify natural compounds with multiple biological activities of interest for AD therapeutics. Plant hydroethanolic extracts were prepared and tested in a panel of phenotypic screening assays that reflect multiple neurotoxicity pathways relevant to AD-oxytosis in hippocampal nerve cells, in vitro ischemia, intracellular amyloid toxicity, inhibition of microglial inflammation and nerve cell differentiation. HPLC fractions from the extract that performed the best in all of the assays were tested in the oxytosis assay, our primary screen, and the most protective fraction was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The predominant compound was purified, its identity confirmed by ESI mass spectrometry and NMR, and then tested in all of the screening assays to determine its efficacy. An extract from the bark of Voacanga africana was more protective than any other plant extract in all of the assays (EC50sâ‰¤2.4Âµg/mL). The HPLC fraction from the extract that was most protective against oxytosis contained the alkaloid voacamine (MW=704.90) as the predominant compound. Purified voacamine was very protective at low doses in all of the assays (EC50sâ‰¤3.4ÂµM). These findings validate the use of our phenotypic screening, cell-based assays to identify potential compounds to treat AD from plant extracts with ethnopharmacological relevance. Our study identifies the alkaloid voacamine as a major compound in Voacanga africana with potent neuroprotective activities in these assays. 
24620982	Epidemiological genetics and meta-analysis of a polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP gene in Alzheimer's disease in Brazil.
Neurol. Res. 20140211 2014Sep
The polymorphism at codon 129 of the prion protein gene (PRNP) is a major risk factor for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Several authors reported neuropathological and clinical overlapping between CJD and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a few association studies generating conflicting results. To investigate the distribution of this polymorphism in AD, we selected 58 patients with probable AD and 73 controls from a Brazilian population. There was no association between the PRNP polymorphism at codon 129 and AD. Our meta-analysis (performed using Alzgene; http://www.alzgene.org ) along with previous studies conducted in Brazil demonstrated a negative association.  
24935788	Disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer's drugs: inhibitors of human cholinesterases interfering with Î²-amyloid aggregation.
CNS Neurosci Ther  2014Jul
We recently described multifunctional tools (2a-c) as potent inhibitors of human Cholinesterases (ChEs) also able to modulate events correlated with AÎ² aggregation. We herein propose a thorough biological and computational analysis aiming at understanding their mechanism of action at the molecular level. We determined the inhibitory potency of 2a-c on AÎ²1-42 self-aggregation, the interference of 2a with the toxic AÎ² oligomeric species and with the postaggregation states by capillary electrophoresis analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The modulation of AÎ² toxicity was assessed for 2a and 2b on human neuroblastoma cells. The key interactions of 2a with AÎ² and with the AÎ²-preformed fibrils were computationally analyzed. 2a-c toxicity profile was also assessed (human hepatocytes and mouse fibroblasts). Our prototypical pluripotent analogue 2a interferes with AÎ² oligomerization process thus reducing AÎ² oligomers-mediated toxicity in human neuroblastoma cells. 2a also disrupts preformed fibrils. Computational studies highlighted the bases governing the diversified activities of 2a. Converging analytical, biological, and in silico data explained the mechanism of action of 2a on AÎ²1-42 oligomers formation and against AÎ²-preformed fibrils. This evidence, combined with toxicity data, will orient the future design of safer analogues. 
24562737	Functional brain connectivity using fMRI in aging and Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychol Rev 20140223 2014Mar
Normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cause profound changes in the brain's structure and function. AD in particular is accompanied by widespread cortical neuronal loss, and loss of connections between brain systems. This degeneration of neural pathways disrupts the functional coherence of brain activation. Recent innovations in brain imaging have detected characteristic disruptions in functional networks. Here we review studies examining changes in functional connectivity, measured through fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), starting with healthy aging and then Alzheimer's disease. We cover studies that employ the three primary methods to analyze functional connectivity--seed-based, ICA (independent components analysis), and graph theory. At the end we include a brief discussion of other methodologies, such as EEG (electroencephalography), MEG (magnetoencephalography), and PET (positron emission tomography). We also describe multi-modal studies that combine rsfMRI (resting state fMRI) with PET imaging, as well as studies examining the effects of medications. Overall, connectivity and network integrity appear to decrease in healthy aging, but this decrease is accelerated in AD, with specific systems hit hardest, such as the default mode network (DMN). Functional connectivity is a relatively new topic of research, but it holds great promise in revealing how brain network dynamics change across the lifespan and in disease. 
23830548	[Prevalence of anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease].
Med Clin (Barc) 20130703 2014Jul7
Anosognosia is a disorder that affects the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), increasing in frequency with the evolution of AD. The objective was to determine the prevalence of anosognosia and analyze the associated factors and predictors. Multicenter transversal and observational study of 345 AD patients. Anosognosia was assessed by Anosognosia Questionnaire-Dementia and the evolutionary stage with the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). Tests used were Mini-Mental State Examination, Disability Assessment for Dementia and Neuropsychiatric Inventory to assess cognition, functional status and neuropsychiatric symptoms, respectively. We adjusted linear regression models to determine the associated variables and binary logistic regression (RLog) to identify predictors of anosognosia. The overall prevalence of anosognosia was 46.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 41.3 to 52.1). The prevalence in stages was 28.4% (GDS 4), 64.6% (GDS 5) and 91.4% (GDS 6). The RLog identified as predictors older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.09), lower functional capacity (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.98), lower cognitive level (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.88-0.99), and greater apathy (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.03-1.18), disinhibition (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.09-1.50), irritability (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.09-1.50) and motor disorders (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.09-1.50). Anosognosia increases with further deterioration. In patients with a mild impairment, predictor variables were apathy, disinhibition and motor disorders. 
24309127	Vision function abnormalities in Alzheimer disease.
Surv Ophthalmol 20131022 2014 Jul-Aug
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive, age-related debilitating condition that is a growing public health problem in the developed world. Visual system abnormalities in AD were recognized in the early 1970s, but were initially considered to be of strictly cortical origin. Studies in the past 20 years reveal that all parts of the visual system may be affected, including the optic nerve and the retina. Some aspects of this involvement are still not well understood and are the subjects of intensive research. We summarize and focus on findings that may be of more practical interest to the ophthalmologist. 
24861310	Pyroglutamylated amyloid-Î² is associated with hyperphosphorylated tau and severity of Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Neuropathol. 20140527 2014Jul
Pyroglutamylated amyloid-Î² (pE(3)-AÎ²) has been suggested to play a major role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis as amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) oligomers containing pE(3)-AÎ² might initiate tau-dependent cytotoxicity. We aimed to further elucidate the associations among pE(3)-AÎ², full-length AÎ² and hyperphosphorylated tau (HP-Ï„) in human brain tissue. We examined 41 post mortem brains of both AD (n = 18) and controls. Sections from frontal and entorhinal cortices were stained with pE(3)-AÎ², HP-Ï„ and full-length AÎ² antibodies. The respective loads were assessed using image analysis and western blot analysis was performed in a subset of cases. All loads were significantly higher in AD, but when using AÎ² loads as independent variables only frontal pE(3)-AÎ² load predicted AD. In frontal and entorhinal cortices pE(3)-AÎ² load independently predicted HP-Ï„ load while non-pE(3)-AÎ² failed to do so. All loads correlated with the severity of AD neuropathology. However, partial correlation analysis revealed respective correlations in the frontal cortex only for pE(3)-AÎ² load only while in the entorhinal cortex respective correlations were seen for both HP-Ï„ and non-pE(3)-AÎ² loads. Mini Mental State Examination scores were independently predicted by entorhinal HP-Ï„ load and by frontal pE(3)-AÎ² load. Here, we report an association between pE(3)-AÎ² and HP-Ï„ in human brain tissue and an influence of frontal pE(3)-AÎ² on both the severity of AD neuropathology and clinical dementia. Our findings further support the notion that pE(3)-AÎ² may represent an important link between AÎ² and HP-Ï„, and investigations into its role as diagnostic and therapeutic target in AD are warranted. 
25054066	Identification of potential herbal inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase associated Alzheimer's disorders using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation.
Biochem Res Int 20140514 2014
Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is) are the standard for the therapy of AD associated disorders and are the only class of approved drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the target for many Alzheimer's dementia drugs which block the function of AChE but have some side effects. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt was made to elucidate cholinesterase inhibition potential of secondary metabolite from Cannabis plant which has negligible or no side effect. Molecular docking of 500 herbal compounds, against AChE, was performed using Autodock 4.2 as per the standard protocols. Molecular dynamics simulations have also been carried out to check stability of binding complex in water for 1000â€‰ps. Our molecular docking and simulation have predicted high binding affinity of secondary metabolite (C28H34N2O6) to AChE. Further, molecular dynamics simulations for 1000â€‰ps suggest that ligand interaction with the residues Asp72, Tyr70-121-334, and Phe288 of AChE, all of which fall under active site/subsite or binding pocket, might be critical for the inhibitory activity of AChE. This approach might be helpful to understand the selectivity of the given drug molecule in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The study provides evidence for consideration of C28H34N2O6 as a valuable small ligand molecule in treatment and prevention of AD associated disorders and further in vitro and in vivo investigations may prove its therapeutic potential.  
24748118	Ventricular and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and posttraumatic hydrocephalus.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Little information is available on the rostro-caudal concentration gradient of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We studied the concentrations of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides 1-42 and 1-40 as well as the Tau and pTau proteins in simultaneously collected ventricular and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. The samples were simultaneously collected from the ventricle and the lumbar spinal canal in two groups of patients: 10 subjects being treated for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) by the placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt and 5 patients treated simultaneously with an external ventricular drain and a lumbar CSF drain due to posttraumatic hydrocephalus (PTH). The ventricular-lumbar (V/L) concentration ratio for AÎ²1-40 was 0.81 in NPH patients and 0.71 in PTH patients. The V/L-ratio for AÎ²1-42 was 0.84 in NPH, reflecting significantly higher concentrations in lumbar CSF than in ventricular CSF, and 1.02 in PTH patients. The V/L-ratios for Tau and pTau differed significantly depending on the diagnostic group: the median V/L-ratio for Tau was 6.83 in NPH patients but only 0.97 in PTH patients. The median V/L-ratio for pTau was 2.36 in NPH patients and 0.91 in PTH patients. We conclude that the rostro-caudal concentration gradient for brain-derived proteins (Tau and pTau in this study) depends on the diagnosis and clinical status of the patient, which were largely neglected in the previously postulated models. 
24762945	Lack of Genetic Association Between TREM2 and Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease in a Japanese Population.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Rare non-synonymous variants of TREM2 have recently been shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caucasians. We here conducted a replication study using a well-characterized Japanese sample set, comprising 2,190 late-onset AD (LOAD) cases and 2,498 controls. We genotyped 10 non-synonymous variants (Q33X, Y38C, R47H, T66M, N68K, D87N, T96K, R98W, H157Y, and L211P) of TREM2 reported by Guerreiro et al. (2013) by means of the TaqMan and dideoxy sequencing methods. Only three variants, R47H, H157Y, and L211P, were polymorphic (range of minor allele frequency [MAF], 0.0002-0.0059); however, no significant association with LOAD was observed in these variants. Considering low MAF of variants examined and our study sample size, further genetic analysis with a larger sample set is needed to firmly evaluate whether or not TREM2 is associated with LOAD in Japanese.  
24762946	Initial memory deficit profiles in patients with a cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease signature.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical onset is usually characterized by a memory complaint and a progressive memory deficit. The proportion of typical medial-temporal amnesia revealing AD remains unknown. The present study explores the episodic memory impairment profiles by the Free and Cued Selective Recall Reminding Test (FCSRT) in patients with initial memory complaint and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker signature of AD. Seventy-three patients referred for memory complaint to the Centers for Memory, Resource and Research of Lyon and Montpellier (France) were included consecutively. All patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological examination and had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score â‰¥20 and a positive CSF AD signature. The patients were classified as having mild dementia or prodromal AD. Verbal episodic memory was assessed using the French version of the FCSRT exploring encoding, storage/consolidation, and cued delayed retrieval phases of memorization. Three different memory profiles were identified according to the results of FCSRT. The median age was 72 year-old [interquartiles: 65-76]. The median MMSE score was 23 [interquartiles: 21-25]. 88% of the patients (n = 64) presented with a medial temporal amnesia profile. The dysexecutive amnesia and normal verbal episodic memory profiles represented respectively 5% (n = 4) and 7% (n = 5). There were no significant differences in term of age, gender, and MMSE score between the three profile groups. In a population initially presenting with memory complaints and depicting a CSF AD signature, a high proportion of medial temporal amnesia is disclosed as expected, but also a proportion of dysexecutive amnesia and normal FCSRT. 
24762948	Hidden risk genes with high-order intragenic epistasis in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Meta-analysis of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has confirmed the high risk of APOE and identified twenty other risk genes/loci with moderate effect size. However, many more risk genes/loci remain to be discovered to account for the missing heritability. The contributions from individual singe-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been thoroughly examined in traditional GWAS data analysis, while SNP-SNP interactions can be explored by a variety of alternative approaches. Here we applied generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction to the re-analysis of four publicly available GWAS datasets for AD. When considering 4-order intragenic SNP interactions, we observed high consistency of discovered potential risk genes among the four independent GWAS datasets. Ten potential risk genes were observed across all four datasets, including PDE1A, RYR3, TEK, SLC25A21, LOC729852, KIRREL3, PTPN5, FSHR, PARK2, and NR3C2. These potential risk genes discovered by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction are highly relevant to AD pathogenesis based on multiple layers of evidence. The genetic contributions of these genes warrant further confirmation in other independent GWAS datasets for AD.  
24769627	Disruption of Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow through the Olfactory System May Contribute to Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Plaques and tangles may be manifestations of a more substantial underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disease-related changes in the clearance of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and other metabolites suggest this cause may involve cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the interstitial spaces of the brain, including an archaic route through the olfactory system that predates neocortical expansion by three hundred million years. This olfactory CSF conduit (OCC) runs from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) along the lateral olfactory stria, through the olfactory trigone, and down the olfactory tract to the olfactory bulb, where CSF seeps through the cribriform plate to the nasal submucosa. Olfactory dysfunction is common in AD and could be related to alterations in CSF flow along the OCC. Further, reductions in OCC flow may impact CSF hydrodynamics upstream in the MTL and basal forebrain, resulting in less efficient AÎ² removal from those areas-among the first affected by neuritic plaques in AD. Factors that reduce CSF drainage across the cribriform plate and slow the clearance of metabolite-laden CSF could include aging-related bone changes, head trauma, inflammation of the nasal epithelium, and toxins that affect olfactory neuron survival and renewal, as well as vascular effects related to diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis-all of which have been linked to AD risk. Problems with CSF-mediated clearance could also provide a link between these seemingly disparate factors and familial AD mutations that induce plaque and tangle formation. I hypothesize that disruptions of CSF flow across the cribriform plate are important early events in AD, and I propose that restoring this flow will enhance the drainage of AÎ² oligomers and other metabolites from the MTL.  
24787912	Ordered subset analysis of copy number variation association with age at onset of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Genetic heterogeneity is a common problem for genome-wide association studies of complex human diseases. Ordered-subset analysis (OSA) reduces genetic heterogeneity and optimizes the use of phenotypic information, thus improving power under some disease models. We hypothesized that in a genetically heterogeneous disorder such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), utilizing OSA by age at onset (AAO) of AD may increase the power to detect relevant loci. Using this approach, 8 loci were detected, including the chr15 : 30,44 region harboring CHRFAM7A. The association was replicated in the NIA-LOAD Familial Study dataset. CHRFAM7A is a dominant negative regulator of CHRNA7 function, the receptor that facilitates amyloid-Î²1-42 internalization through endocytosis and has been implicated in AD. OSA, using AAO as a quantitative trait, optimized power and detected replicable signals suggesting that AD is genetically heterogeneous between AAO subsets.  
24787913	Utility of SPM8 plus DARTEL (VSRAD) Combined with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy as Adjunct Techniques for Screening and Predicting Dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease in Clinical Practice.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
We validated the utility of SPM8 plus DARTEL (VSRAD) combined with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) as an adjunct screening technique for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined the posterior cingulate gyri of 228 subjects using VSRAD and 1H MRS in addition to conventional cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers at baseline. At the 3-year follow-up, the 228 subject were classified as follows: 93 healthy subjects, 42 MCI-non-converters (MCI-NC), 25 MCI-converters to AD (MCI-C), 44 AD, 8 dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 5 normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 11 patients with other neurological diseases. Our results demonstrated that subjects with increased medial temporal atrophy (MTA) severity on VSRAD, increased Cho/Cr, MI/Cr ratio, and decreased NAA/Cr and NAA/MI ratio on 1H MRS at baseline were at risk of dementia due to AD. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that severity of MTA and the NAA/MI ratio distinguished patients with AD and MCI-C from controls. Furthermore, the 118 subjects without dementia and MTA showing only a decreased NAA/MI ratio at baseline developed to MCI-C, AD, and DLB 3 years later. 1H MRS detected biochemical abnormalities preceding brain atrophy and cognitive decline. VSRAD combined with 1H MRS may be routinely applied to screen for MCI/AD and prodromal AD in clinical practice.  
24787914	Antipsychotic Polypharmacy among a Nationwide Sample of Community-Dwelling Persons with Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) is not recommended in treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). There is lack of studies concerning prevalence of APP among persons with dementia. The objective of our study was to describe prevalence and risk factors associated with antipsychotic polypharmacy among antipsychotic users with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data from nationwide MEDALZ-2005 cohort including all community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD in Finland was utilized. Register-based data included prescriptions, comorbidities, and hospital discharge diagnoses. Users of antipsychotics during 2006-2009 were included (n = 9,803). The risk of starting antipsychotic polypharmacy was evaluated with Cox proportional hazards model. Prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy was 8% (n = 750) among antipsychotic users (n = 9,803). Quetiapine and risperidone was the most common combination of two antipsychotics followed by combination of quetiapine and haloperidol. Antipsychotic polypharmacy was associated with younger age (HR 1.35 [Confidence Interval, CI, 1.16-1.56]), male gender (HR 1.18 [CI 1.02-1.38]), and history of psychiatric disorder (HR 1.50 [CI 1.26-1.78]) in the adjusted model. In conclusion, we found higher prevalence of APP than previously reported among older populations. This is concerning since effectiveness of APP has not been demonstrated and APP is not recommended in the treatment of BPSD. Clinicians should pay more attention to avoid APP and use of antipsychotics to other indications than BPSD among persons with AD. 
24799341	Disturbed default mode network connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease associated with visual processing.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Changes in connectivity of the posterior node of the default mode network (DMN) were studied when switching from baseline to a cognitive task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In all, 15 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 18 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Psychophysiological interactions analysis was used to assess the specific alterations in the DMN connectivity (deactivation-based) due to psychological effects from the complex visual scene encoding task. In HC, we observed task-induced connectivity decreases between the posterior cingulate and middle temporal and occipital visual cortices. These findings imply successful involvement of the ventral visual pathway during the visual processing in our HC cohort. In AD, involvement of the areas engaged in the ventral visual pathway was observed only in a small volume of the right middle temporal gyrus. Additional connectivity changes (decreases) in AD were present between the posterior cingulate and superior temporal gyrus when switching from baseline to task condition. These changes are probably related to both disturbed visual processing and the DMN connectivity in AD and reflect deficits and compensatory mechanisms within the large scale brain networks in this patient population. Studying the DMN connectivity using psychophysiological interactions analysis may provide a sensitive tool for exploring early changes in AD and their dynamics during the disease progression.  
24844691	Tubastatin A/ACY-1215 Improves Cognition in Alzheimer's Disease Transgenic Mice.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is currently being discussed as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mounting evidence indicates that increased HDAC6 expression may contribute to AD-associated neurodegeneration, although beneficial effects have also been identified. In the present study, we tested the potential of two selective HDAC6 inhibitors, tubastatin A and ACY-1215, to rescue cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD. We found that both tubastatin A and ACY-1215 alleviated behavioral deficits, altered amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) load, and reduced tau hyperphosphorylation in AD mice without obvious adverse effects. Our data suggested that tubastatin A and ACY-1215 not only promoted tubulin acetylation, but also reduced production and facilitated autophagic clearance of AÎ² and hyperphosphorylated tau. Further, the decreased hyperphosphorylated tau and increased tubulin acetylation may account for the improved microtubule stability in AD mice after tubastatin A/ACY-1215 treatment. These preclinical results support the detrimental role of HDAC6 in AD, and offer prospective approaches for using tubastatin A/ACY-1215 as potential therapeutic strategy for AD.  
23671023	Increased frequency of cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14+) monocytes expressing interleukin 1 beta (IL-1Î²) in Alzheimer's disease patients and intermediate levels in late-onset depression patients.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130514 2014Feb
Depression might be a prodromal stage of dementia. Many factors contribute to the etiology of depression and dementia, being inflammation one of those. The present work measured and analyzed immune molecules involved in the innate immunity on cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14+) monocytes trying to investigate any relationship among late-onset depression (LOD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immune molecules were evaluated in monocytes of AD, LOD patients, and controls using flow cytometry. Interestingly, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1Î²) expressing CD14+ monocytes were increased in AD patients compared with controls. LOD presented intermediate frequency of CD14+ monocytes expressing IL-1Î² between controls and AD patients. Results suggest that an increased frequency of CD14+ monocytes expressing IL-1Î² level could be a stage marker related to the pathophysiology of dementia process between normal aging and AD. 
23681754	Vascular risk factors and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: the Cache County Study.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130517 2014Feb
Knowledge of potentially modifiable risk factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important. This study longitudinally explores modifiable vascular risk factors for NPS in AD. Participants enrolled in the Cache County Study on Memory in Aging with no dementia at baseline were subsequently assessed over three additional waves, and those with incident (new onset) dementia were invited to join the Dementia Progression Study for longitudinal follow-up. A total of 327 participants with incident AD were identified and assessed for the following vascular factors: atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, angina, coronary artery bypass surgery, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and use of antihypertensive or diabetes medicines. A vascular index (VI) was also calculated. NPS were assessed over time using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Affective and Psychotic symptom clusters were assessed separately. The association between vascular factors and change in NPI total score was analyzed using linear mixed model and in symptom clusters using a random effects model. No individual vascular risk factors or the VI significantly predicted change in any individual NPS. The use of antihypertensive medications more than four times per week was associated with higher total NPI and Affective cluster scores. Use of antihypertensive medication was associated with higher total NPI and Affective cluster scores. The results of this study do not otherwise support vascular risk factors as modifiers of longitudinal change in NPS in AD. 
23722989	History of a suspected delirium is more common in dementia with Lewy bodies than Alzheimer's disease: a retrospective study.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130531 2014Feb
Delirium is common and is associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, it is not clear whether delirium confers increased risk of any particular type of dementia. We performed a retrospective study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) to ascertain whether a suspected episode of preceding delirium was more common prior to diagnosis in either type of dementia. The study was carried out in a tertiary referral unit for the diagnosis of dementia. Clinic letters from the first presentation to the unit of 85 cases with DLB and 95 cases of AD were reviewed for documentation of any previous episodes of suspected delirium. In this study, 25% of DLB cases had at least one reported episode of suspected delirium as compared to 7% of AD cases (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). For the DLB cases who had a prior suspected delirium, 23% had more than one episode compared with 14% of the AD group. The median time between most recent suspected episode of delirium and diagnosis of dementia in both groups was less than a year A greater proportion of those presenting and diagnosed with DLB had a documentation of a suspected delirium than those diagnosed with AD. Delirium may lead to a higher risk of DLB as opposed to other forms of dementia, or delirium may, at least in some cases, represent the early stages of DLB. These data suggest that a diagnosis of DLB should be specifically considered in those presenting with a delirium. 
23925829	Art and the brain: a view from dementia.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130808 2014Feb
Art making encompasses a range of perceptual and cognitive functions involving widely distributed brain systems. The dementias impact on these systems in different ways, raising the possibility that each dementia has a unique artistic signature. Here we use a review of the visual art of 14 artists with dementia (five Alzheimer's disease, seven fronto-temporal dementia and two dementia with Lewy bodies) to further our understanding of the neurobiological constituents of art production and higher artistic function. Artists with Alzheimer's disease had prominent changes in spatial aspects of their art and attributes of colour and contrast. These qualities were preserved in the art of fronto-temporal dementia, which was characterised by perseverative themes and a shift towards realistic representation. The art of dementia with Lewy Bodies was characterised by simple, bizarre content. The limitations of using visual aspects of individual artworks to infer the impact of dementia on art production are discussed with the need for a wider perspective encompassing changes in cognition, emotion, creativity and artistic personality. A novel classificatory scheme is presented to help characterise neural mechanisms of higher artistic functions in future studies. 
24821250	Advance directives, dementia, and withholding food and water by mouth.
Hastings Cent Rep  2014 May-Jun
People with dementia who are no longer competent have limited control over how their lives end. But an advance directive to withhold food and water by mouth could be used to ensure that one does not live for years in severe dementia. Such directives are arguably already legal. 
24894353	The involvement of lipids in Alzheimer's disease.
J Genet Genomics 20140502 2014May20
It has been estimated that Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, will affect approximately 81 million individuals by 2040. To date, the actual cause and cascade of events in the progression of this disease have not been fully determined. Furthermore, there is currently no definitive blood test or simple diagnostic method for AD. Considerable efforts have been put into proteomic approaches to develop a diagnostic blood test, but to date these efforts have not been successful. More recently, there has been a stronger focus on lipidomic studies in the hope of increasing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to AD and developing an AD blood test. It is well known that the strongest genetic risk factor for AD is the Îµ4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE). Evidence suggests that the ApoE protein, a major lipid transporter, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD, and its role in both normal and aberrant lipid metabolism warrants further extensive investigation. Here, we review ApoE-lipid interactions, as well as the roles that lipids may play in the pathogenesis of AD.  
24886182	Neuroinflammation and related neuropathologies in APPSL mice: further value of this in vivo model of Alzheimer's disease.
J Neuroinflammation 20140501 2014
Beyond cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by numerous neuropathological changes in the brain. Although animal models generally do not fully reflect the broad spectrum of disease-specific alterations, the APPSL mouse model is well known to display early plaque formation and to exhibit spatial learning and memory deficits. However, important neuropathological features, such as neuroinflammation and lipid peroxidation, and their progression over age, have not yet been described in this AD mouse model. Hippocampal and neocortical tissues of APPSL mice at different ages were evaluated. One hemisphere from each mouse was examined for micro- and astrogliosis as well as concomitant plaque load. The other hemisphere was evaluated for lipid peroxidation (quantified by a thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay), changes in AÎ² abundance (AÎ²38, AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 analyses), as well as determination of aggregated AÎ² content (Amorfix A4 assay). Finally, correlation analyses were performed to illustrate the time-dependent correlation between neuroinflammation and AÎ² load (soluble, insoluble, fibrils), or lipid peroxidation, respectively. As is consistent with previous findings, neuroinflammation starts early and shows strong progression over age in the APPSL mouse model. An analyses of concomitant AÎ² load and plaque deposition revealed a similar progression, and high correlations between neuroinflammation markers and soluble or insoluble AÎ² or fibrillar amyloid plaque loads were observed. Lipid peroxidation, as measured by TBARS levels, correlates well with neuroinflammation in the neocortex but not the hippocampus. The hippocampal lipid peroxidation correlated strongly with the increase of LOC positive fiber load, whereas neocortical TBARS levels were unrelated to amyloidosis. These data illustrate for the first time the progression of major AD related neuropathological features other than plaque load in the APPSL mouse model. Specifically, we demonstrate that microgliosis and astrocytosis are prominent aspects of this AD mouse model. The strong correlation of neuroinflammation with amyloid burden and lipid peroxidation underlines the importance of these pathological factors for the development of AD. The new finding of a different relation of lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus and neocortical regions show that the model might contribute to the understanding of complex pathological mechanisms and their interplay in AD. 
23246214	The role of glial cells in Alzheimer disease: potential therapeutic implications.
Neurologia 20121214 2014Jun
Alzheimer (AD) disease is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterised by inflammation, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and reactive gliosis. Microglia and astrocytes not only act as antigen-presenting cells, but also function as effector cells releasing pro-inflammatory molecules that promote excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration. In the present review we discuss the role of glia, specifically microglia and astrocytes, in the pathophysiology of AD and possible therapeutic implications. The growing body of evidence suggesting that microglia and astrocytes play a pathogenic role and activate inflammation pathways, the neurotoxic factors released by these cells when activated, and the way these factors may disrupt the homeostasis of the central nervous system all support the hypothesis that glia-induced inflammation exacerbates AD. Inhibiting inflammation by deactivating glial cells may reduce the production of factors which contribute to neurotoxicity, and therefore result in clinical improvement. Microglia and astrocytes are therapeutic targets for the development of new drugs to combat this disease. Therapeutic strategies designed to counter the detrimental effects of overactivation of these cell populations should be investigated. 
24035297	Benefits of deep encoding in Alzheimer disease. Analysis of performance on a memory task using the Item Specific Deficit Approach.
Neurologia 20130910 2014Jun
the aim of this study is to test the encoding deficit hypothesis in Alzheimer disease (AD) using a recent method for correcting memory tests. To this end, a Spanish-language adaptation of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test was interpreted using the Item Specific Deficit Approach (ISDA), which provides three indices: Encoding Deficit Index, Consolidation Deficit Index, and Retrieval Deficit Index. We compared the performances of 15 patients with AD and 20 healthy control subjects and analysed results using either the task instructions or the ISDA approach. patients with AD displayed deficient encoding of more than half the information, but items that were encoded properly could be retrieved later with the help of the same semantic clues provided individually during encoding. Virtually all the information retained over the long-term was retrieved by using semantic clues. Encoding was shown to be the most impaired process, followed by retrieval and consolidation. Discriminant function analyses showed that ISDA indices are more sensitive and specific for detecting memory impairments in AD than are raw scores. These results indicate that patients with AD present impaired information encoding, but they benefit from semantic hints that help them recover previously learned information. This should be taken into account for intervention techniques focusing on memory impairments in AD. 
24899710	Genetic modulation of soluble AÎ² rescues cognitive and synaptic impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurosci.  2014Jun4
An unresolved debate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is whether amyloid plaques are pathogenic, causing overt physical disruption of neural circuits, or protective, sequestering soluble forms of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) that initiate synaptic damage and cognitive decline. Few animal models of AD have been capable of isolating the relative contribution made by soluble and insoluble forms of AÎ² to the behavioral symptoms and biochemical consequences of the disease. Here we use a controllable transgenic mouse model expressing a mutant form of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to distinguish the impact of soluble AÎ² from that of deposited amyloid on cognitive function and synaptic structure. Rapid inhibition of transgenic APP modulated the production of AÎ² without affecting pre-existing amyloid deposits and restored cognitive performance to the level of healthy controls in Morris water maze, radial arm water maze, and fear conditioning. Selective reduction of AÎ² with a Î³-secretase inhibitor provided similar improvement, suggesting that transgene suppression restored cognition, at least in part by lowering AÎ². Cognitive improvement coincided with reduced levels of synaptotoxic AÎ² oligomers, greater synaptic density surrounding amyloid plaques, and increased expression of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. Together these findings indicate that transient AÎ² species underlie much of the cognitive and synaptic deficits observed in this model and demonstrate that significant functional and structural recovery can be attained without removing deposited amyloid.  
24899720	Genetic reduction of mammalian target of rapamycin ameliorates Alzheimer's disease-like cognitive and pathological deficits by restoring hippocampal gene expression signature.
J. Neurosci.  2014Jun4
Elevated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling has been found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and is linked to diabetes and aging, two known risk factors for AD. However, whether hyperactive mTOR plays a role in the cognitive deficits associated with AD remains elusive. Here, we genetically reduced mTOR signaling in the brains of Tg2576 mice, a widely used animal model of AD. We found that suppression of mTOR signaling reduced amyloid-Î² deposits and rescued memory deficits. Mechanistically, the reduction in mTOR signaling led to an increase in autophagy induction and restored the hippocampal gene expression signature of the Tg2576 mice to wild-type levels. Our results implicate hyperactive mTOR signaling as a previous unidentified signaling pathway underlying gene-expression dysregulation and cognitive deficits in AD. Furthermore, hyperactive mTOR signaling may represent a molecular pathway by which aging contributes to the development of AD.  
24747209	Very mild Alzheimer×³s disease is characterized by increased sensitivity to mnemonic interference.
Neuropsychologia 20140418 2014Jul
Early pathology and tissue loss in Alzheimer×³s disease (AD) occurs in the hippocampus, a brain region that has recently been implicated in relational processing irrespective of delay. Thus, tasks that involve relational processing will especially tax the hippocampal memory system, and should be sensitive to even mild dysfunction typical of early AD. Here we used a short-lag, short-delay memory task previously shown to be sensitive to hippocampal integrity in an effort to discriminate cognitive changes due to healthy aging from those associated with very mild AD. Young adults, healthy older adults, and individuals with very mild AD (N=30 for each group) participated in our investigation, which entailed attempting to find an exact match to a previously presented target among a series of stimuli that varied in perceptual similarity to the target stimulus. Older adults with very mild AD were less accurate than healthy older adults, who, in turn, were impaired relative to young adults. Older adults with very mild AD were also particularly susceptible to interference from intervening lure stimuli. A measure based on this finding was able to explain additional variance in differentiating those in the very mild stage of AD from healthy older adults after accounting for episodic memory and global cognition composite scores in logistic regression models. Our findings suggest that cognitive changes in early stage AD reflect aging along with an additional factor potentially centered on sensitivity to interference, thereby supporting multifactorial models of aging.  
24857745	Meta-analysis of PvuII, XbaI variants in ESR1 gene and the risk of Alzheimer's disease: the regional European difference.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140522 2014Jun27
The PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms of ESR1 gene have been reported in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies. However, whether these ESR1 genetic variants can contribute to the risk of AD remains controversial. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the association between ESR1 polymorphisms and the occurrence of AD. Articles were identified by systematic searches in PubMed, Google scholar and Wan Fang Med Online database. The combined odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated within different inherited models. Publication bias tests, subgroup analyses and sensitive analyses were also performed. Overall, the PvuII variant was negatively associated with AD in the Caucasian population (pp vs PP+Pp, OR 0.86, 95%CI (0.76, 0.96)). However, there was a poor association between XbaI polymorphism and AD in European populations. In particular, PvuII variant was found significantly associated with a decreased AD risk in South European samples (pp vs PP+Pp, OR 0.86, 95%CI (0.75, 0.98)). This meta-analysis indicated that regional European differences of ESR1 PvuII polymorphism in the association with the occurrence of AD, which need to be further identified, especially in South European countries.  
24939403	[Qualitative approach of medical support of spouse caregivers of Alzheimer patients].
Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil  2014Jun
The caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) play a key role in their management. Half of them are spouses. This involvement may alter their own health, leading to exhaustion and depression. Since 2010, general practitioners (GPs) have been invited in France to offer an annual specific medical support to spouse caregivers. The aims of this study were to understand their experience of this situation by spouse caregivers, and how the spouse caregiver perceives the role of the GP in this context. A qualitative approach was conducted using semi-structured interviews of 14 spouse caregivers recruited from adult day care in Angers, France. The analysis of interviews showed that AD was an existential crisis for the dyad AD patient/spouse caregiver. The emotional connection and the sense of commitment strongly involved the spouse caregivers into cares for the loved ones. Even if the frequency of medical consultations remained unchanged, caregivers were more prone to delay non-urgent cares for themselves. Moreover their intention to handle things on their own and the interaction with health professionals of the care recipients interfered with the involvement of the caregivers' GPs. Caregivers' adaptation to their spouses' AD resulted in both negative and positive behaviors. Instead of a mandatory annual consultation focused on caregivers' health, the improvement of communication between all support services, including caregivers' GPs, may help to enhance the medical support of spouse caregivers of AD patients. 
24939409	[A comparison of the performances between healthy older adults and persons with Alzheimer's disease on the Rey auditory verbal learning test and the Test de rappel libre/rappel indicÃ© 16 items].
Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil  2014Jun
The aim of this research was to compare the performances of healthy elderly (n=40) and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=40) on the RL/RI 16, a French adaptation of the Free and cued selective reminding test (FCSRT) and on the Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT). These two verbal episodic memory tests are frequently used in clinical practice in French-speaking populations. Results showed that the RAVLT demonstrated a slightly better sensitivity and sensibility than the RL/RI 16. The RAVLT allowed to classify participants of the two groups without any overlap. Moreover, no floor effect was observed in the RAVLT in AD and ceiling effects were less pronounced in normal controls that in the RL/RI 16. Results observed in the RL/RI 16 showed important ceiling effects and a decline in performance on free recall throughout trials in AD patients. Nonetheless, the latter tool was less sensitive to recency effects than the RAVLT and may thus provide a more realistic view of the long-term memory performance of these patients. The semantic cues provided in the RL/RI 16 appeared to increase intrusions in AD whereas the interference list in the RAVLT was the first source of false recognitions in both healthy elderly and AD. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates both the advantages and disadvantages of these two tools in the evaluation of episodic memory in elderly with and without cognitive deficits.  
25045700	In silico investigation of traditional chinese medicine compounds to inhibit human histone deacetylase 2 for patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140623 2014
Human histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) has been identified as being associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neuropathic degenerative disease. In this study, we screen the world's largest Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) database for natural compounds that may be useful as lead compounds in the search for inhibitors of HDAC2 function. The technique of molecular docking was employed to select the ten top TCM candidates. We used three prediction models, multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), and the Bayes network toolbox (BNT), to predict the bioactivity of the TCM candidates. Molecular dynamics simulation provides the protein-ligand interactions of compounds. The bioactivity predictions of pIC50 values suggest that the TCM candidatesm, (-)-Bontl ferulate, monomethylcurcumin, and ningposides C, have a greater effect on HDAC2 inhibition. The structure variation caused by the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between protein-ligand interactions indicates that these compounds have an inhibitory effect on the protein.  
25050360	Chronic dietary supplementation of 4% figs on the modification of oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse model.
Biomed Res Int 20140619 2014
We assessed the changes in the plasma AÎ², oxidative stress/antioxidants, and membrane bound enzymes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic mice (Tg2576) after dietary supplementation of Omani figs fruits for 15 months along with spatial memory and learning test. AD Tg mice on control diet without figs showed significant impairment in spatial learning ability compared to the wild-type mice on same diet and figs fed Tg mice as well. Significant increase in oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant status were observed in AD Tg mice. 4% figs treated AD Tg mice significantly attenuated oxidative damage, as evident by decreased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls and restoration of antioxidant status. Altered activities of membrane bound enzymes (Na(+) K(+) ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)) in AD Tg mice brain regions and was restored by figs treatment. Further, figs supplementation might be able to decrease the plasma levels of AÎ² (1-40, 1-42) significantly in Tg mice suggesting a putative delay in the formation of plaques, which might be due to the presence of high natural antioxidants in figs. But this study warrants further extensive investigation to find a novel lead for a therapeutic target for AD from figs.  
25050129	Fumanjian, a Classic Chinese Herbal Formula, Can Ameliorate the Impairment of Spatial Learning and Memory through Apoptotic Signaling Pathway in the Hippocampus of Rats with AÎ² 1-40 -Induced Alzheimer's Disease.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140622 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and lacks disease-altering treatments. Fumanjian (FMJ), a famous classic Chinese herbal prescription for dementia, was first recorded in the Complete Works of Jingyue during the Ming Dynasty. This study aimed to investigate whether FMJ could prevent cognitive deficit and take neuroprotective effects in AÎ² 1-40-induced rat model through apoptotic signaling pathway. AD model was established by bilateral injection of AÎ² 1-40 into hippocampus in rat. All rats were tested for their capabilities of spatial navigation and memorization by Morris water maze. Apoptosis was tested using TUNEL staining in hippocampus neuronal cells; RT-PCR tested expression of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA; western blotting tested protein level of cleaved caspase-3. After 14 days of treatment, FMJ significantly improved the escape latency and enhanced platform-cross number compared with the AÎ² 1-40-injected group (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01). FMJ also significantly decreased number of TUNEL-positive neuronal apoptosis and the expressions of Bax and cleaved Caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 (P &lt; 0.01) compared with AD model group. In conclusion, FMJ exerts a protective effect against AÎ² 1-40-induced learning and memory deficits and neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that FMJ could be used as a potential therapeutic formula for AD.  
24685635	Increased Plasma TACE Activity in Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Evidence suggests that the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-signaling pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). TNF-Î± converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17) can cleave both pro-TNF-Î± and TNF receptors. Recently, we have shown that TACE activity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients is significantly higher than that of cognitively healthy controls (HC). To date, it is not clear whether TACE activity could be detected in the human plasma and whether TACE activity in MCI and AD patients is different from that in HC. We analyzed TACE expression and activity in a large clinical sample of 64 patients with AD, 88 subjects with MCI, and 50 age-matched HC recruited from two distinct academic centers. Plasma TACE protein levels did not differ significantly in the three study groups (AD, MCI, and HC). However, plasma TACE activity in subjects with MCI and AD patients was significantly higher than that in HC. Moreover, in MCI and AD groups, we found a significant correlation between plasma TACE activity and CSF t-tau and AÎ²42 levels and CSF AÎ²42/tau ratios. In AD patients, the levels of plasma TACE activity correlated significantly and negatively with cognition. These findings further support the role of the TNF-Î± receptor complex in AD-related neuroinflammation and propose TACE plasma activity as a promising hypothesis-driven biomarker candidate for detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of prodromal and clinical AD.  
24853408	The impact of aging and Alzheimer's disease on emotional enhancement of memory.
Eur. Neurol. 20140514 2014
Emotional enhancement of memory (EEM) has been a well-known phenomenon which corresponds to the advantage of emotional stimuli to be better recalled than neutral ones. Previous studies suggest that aging favours recollection of positive items and this pattern is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emotional valence of different stimulus modalities, i.e. pictures and words, may also have an effect on each other's memory performances. However, none of these were clearly studied in AD. This study aimed to evaluate how emotional valences of simultaneously presented stimuli affected recall in healthy young (YG, n = 30), healthy elderly (HE, n = 30) participants and in patients with AD (n = 30). A battery consisting of emotional words presented on emotional pictures was developed. An analysis of a 3 (Groups) Ã— 3 (Emotional Valence of Picture) Ã— 3 (Emotional Valence of Word) mixed ANOVA design was carried out. Patients with AD could process emotional information similarly to healthy participants; however, they had EEM only for picture recalling. Emotional valence of the co-presented stimulus had a boosting effect both in the YG and HE, but not in AD group, especially if both of the stimuli had the same emotional valence. This study highlights the impaired EEM for verbal and preserved EEM for non-verbal declarative memory in patients with AD, the neurobiological underpinnings of which should be addressed by future studies.

24318838	Acetylcholinesterase protein level is preserved in the Alzheimer's brain.
J. Mol. Neurosci. 20131207 2014Jul
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key enzyme in the cholinergic nervous system and is one of the most studied proteins in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, alternative functions of AChE unrelated with the hydrolysis of acetylcholine are suspected. Until now, the majority of investigations on AChE in AD pathology have been focused on the determination of its enzymatic activity level, which is depleted in the AD brain. Despite this overall decrease, AChE activity increases at the vicinity of the two hallmarks of AD, the amyloid plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). In fact, AChE may directly interact with AÎ² in a manner that increases the deposition of AÎ² to form plaques. In the context of protein-protein interactions, we have recently reported that AChE can interact with presenilin-1, the catalytic component of Î³-secretase, influencing its expression level and also its activity. However, the alteration of AChE protein in the AD brain has not been determined. Here, we demonstrated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry that a prominent pool of enzymatically inactive AChE protein existed in the AD brain. The potential significance of these unexpected levels of inactive AChE protein in the AD brain was discussed, especially in the context of protein-protein interactions with Î²-amyloid and presenilin-1.  
24362678	Evidences for B6C3-Tg (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) Double-Transgenic Mice Between 3 and 10Â Months as an Age-Related Alzheimer's Disease Model.
J. Mol. Neurosci. 20131221 2014Jul
Transgenic mouse has shown great advantages in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and drug screening as AD develops rapidly resent years, while more detail information of these transgenic mice and experience of application are needed. To obtain the basic background information of the B6C3-Tg (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) double-transgenic mouse, which was reported with early onset AD, three- to ten-month-old B6C3-Tg AD mice and normal C57BL/6 mice were selected randomly to test the ability of learning memory by Morris water maze, the brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by AChE kit, and beta amyloid protein level by immunohistochemistry staining. Compared with the control group, the escape latency time of B6C3-Tg AD mice at 9 and 10Â months of age is significantly longer (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) in Morris maze test, and the activity of brain AChE is higher. Î²-Amyloid plaques were observed at 3Â months of age and developed rapidly. Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the area of these plaques and the ages of B6C3-Tg AD mouse (yâ€‰=â€‰0.0355e(0.5557x), Râ€‰=â€‰0.9557). The model's behavior is conformed to simulate behaviors of human Alzheimer's disease at the early stage and may provide detail background information a new choice when transgenic mice are needed in the research of AD.  
25004796	The molecular mechanism of fullerene-inhibited aggregation of Alzheimer's Î²-amyloid peptide fragment.
Nanoscale  2014Jul24
Amyloid deposits are implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of Î²-sheet formation has been considered as the primary therapeutic strategy for AD. Increasing data show that nanoparticles can retard or promote the fibrillation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides depending on the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, our replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations show that fullerene nanoparticle - C60 (with a fullereneâ€‰:â€‰ peptide molar ratio greater than 1â€‰:â€‰8) can dramatically prevent Î²-sheet formation of AÎ²(16-22) peptides. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments further confirm the inhibitory effect of C60 on AÎ²(16-22) fibrillation, in support of our REMD simulations. An important finding from our REMD simulations is that fullerene C180, albeit with the same number of carbon atoms as three C60 molecules (3C60) and smaller surface area than 3C60, displays an unexpected stronger inhibitory effect on the Î²-sheet formation of AÎ²(16-22) peptides. A detailed analysis of the fullerene-peptide interaction reveals that the stronger inhibition of Î²-sheet formation by C180 results from the strong hydrophobic and aromatic-stacking interactions of the fullerene hexagonal rings with the Phe rings relative to the pentagonal rings. The strong interactions between the fullerene nanoparticles and AÎ²(16-22) peptides significantly weaken the peptide-peptide interaction that is important for Î²-sheet formation, thus retarding AÎ²(16-22) fibrillation. Overall, our studies reveal the significant role of fullerene hexagonal rings in the inhibition of AÎ²(16-22) fibrillation and provide novel insight into the development of drug candidates against Alzheimer's disease.  
24151909	Nicotinamide treatment reduces the levels of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and PARP-1 activity in AÎ²(1-42)-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
Free Radic. Res. 20131111 2014Feb
The underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are still unclear. It is suggested that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) overactivation can cause neuroinflammation and cell death. In this study we searched the effects of nicotinamide (NA), endogenous PARP-1 inhibitor, on oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the regulation of PARP-1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) in amyloid beta peptide (1-42) (AÎ²(1-42))-induced neurodegeneration. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups as control, AÎ²(1-42), AÎ²(1-42) + NA(100 and 500 mg/kg). All groups were stereotaxically injected bilaterally into the hippocampus with AÎ²(1-42) or saline. After surgery NA administrations were made intraperitoneally (ip) for 7 days. In order to investigate the effects of AÎ²(1-42) and NA, protein carbonyls, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, glutathione (GSH) levels, activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), mitochondrial function, mRNA and protein levels of PARP-1, NF-ÎºB, p53, Bax, and Bcl-2 were measured in specific brain regions such as cortex and hippocampus. AÎ²(1-42) treatment only increased the oxidative stress parameters and caused decline in antioxidant enzyme activities, mitochondrial function, and GSH levels. Also, overexpression of PARP-1, NF-ÎºB, p53, Bax, and the decreased levels of Bcl-2 were observed in AÎ²(1-42)-treated group. NA treatments against AÎ²(1-42)-upregulated Bcl-2 and downregulated PARP-1, NF-ÎºB, p53, and Bax levels. NA treatments also decreased the oxidative stress parameters and elevated antioxidant enzyme activities, GSH levels, and mitochondrial function against AÎ²(1-42) treatment. These data suggest that NA may have a therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative processes due to the decreased levels of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and PARP-1 activity. 
24735980	Neuropathological role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in Down syndrome brain.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20140413 2014Jul
Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability characterized by the presence of three copies of chromosome 21 (Chr21). Individuals with DS have sufficient neuropathology for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) after the age of 40years. The aim of our study is to gain new insights in the molecular mechanisms impaired in DS subjects that eventually lead to the development of dementia. We evaluate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in the frontal cortex from DS cases (under the age of 40years) and DS with AD neuropathology compared with age-matched controls (Young and Old). The PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis may control several key pathways involved in AD that, if aberrantly regulated, affect amyloid beta (AÎ²) deposition and tau phosphorylation. Our results show a hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in individuals with DS, with and without AD pathology, in comparison with respective controls. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR deregulation results in decreased autophagy, inhibition of IRS1 and GSK3Î² activity. Moreover, our data suggest that aberrant activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis acts in parallel to RCAN1 in phosphorylating tau, in DS and DS/AD. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the neuropathological mechanisms that may be engaged during the development of AD in DS. We suggest that deregulation of this signaling cascade is already evident in young DS cases and persist in the presence of AD pathology. The impairment of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in DS population might represent a key-contributing factor to the neurodegenerative process that culminates in Alzheimer-like dementia.  
24728335	The screening of Alzheimer's patients with CSF biomarkers, modulates the distribution of APOE genotype: impact on clinical trials.
J. Neurol. 20140412 2014Jun
Polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) plays a role in the level of neuropathological lesions and in drug response in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the selection of AD patients based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers assessment may be biased by their APOE distribution. We studied the relationships between APOE genotype and CSF biomarkers levels in a total of 432 patients (AD, n = 244; non-AD, n = 188) explored for cognitive disorders. We studied the distribution of APOE genotypes among AD patient subgroups selected by various cut-offs of CSF biomarkers. Strategies of screening based on CSF AÎ²1-42 lead to overselection of Îµ4/Îµ4 patients in the AD group. Screening based on tau levels did not change Apoe4 distribution in the AD group. CSF AÎ²1-42 discriminated better AD patients with at least one Îµ4 than AD patients with no Îµ4. A strong allele-effect relationship was detected between APOE genotype and CSF amyloid-Î² (AÎ²1-42) in AD patients. Selecting AD patients on CSF amyloid levels only may create an overselection of Îµ4/Îµ4 carriers, and might potentially bias the population of patients included in clinical trial studies. 
24807087	Cerebrospinal fluid analysis in Alzheimer's disease: technical issues and future developments.
J. Neurol. 20140508 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and a major epidemic worldwide. Although clinical assessment continues to remain the keystone for patient management and clinical trials, such evaluation has important limitations. In this context, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are important tools to better identify high-risk individuals, to diagnose AD promptly and accurately, especially at the prodromal mild cognitive impairment stage of the disease, and to effectively prognosticate and treat AD patients. Recent advances in functional genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and bioinformatics will hopefully revolutionize unbiased inquiries into several putative CSF markers of cerebral pathology that may be concisely informative with regard to the various stages of AD progression through years and decades. Moreover, the identification of efficient drug targets and development of optimal therapeutic strategies for AD will increasingly rely on a better understanding and integration of the systems biology paradigm, which will allow predicting the series of events and resulting responses of the biological network triggered by the introduction of new therapeutic compounds. In this scenario, unbiased systems biology-based diagnostic and prognostic models in AD will consist of relevant comprehensive panels of molecules and key branches of the disease-affected cellular neuronal network. Such characteristic and unbiased biomarkers will more accurately and comprehensively reflect pathophysiology from the early asymptomatic and presymptomatic to the final prodromal and symptomatic clinical stages in individual patients (and their individual genetic disease predisposition), ultimately increasing the chances of success of future disease modifying and preventive treatments.  
24852598	New mouse model of Alzheimer's.
ACS Chem Neurosci 20140522 2014Jul16
Amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) accumulation is a key characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD); therefore, mouse models of AD exhibiting AÎ² pathology are valuable tools for unraveling disease mechanisms. However, the overexpression of AÎ² precursor protein (APP) used in previous mouse models may cause AÎ²-independent artifacts that influence data interpretation. To circumvent these problems, we used an APP knock-in (KI) strategy to introduce mutations to the mouse APP gene to develop a new generation of AD mouse models. These new models, termed APP(NL-F) and APP(NL-G-F), have endogenous APP levels and develop robust AÎ² amyloidosis, which induce synaptic degeneration and memory impairments. Thus, we suggest that these novel APP KI mice will serve as important tools to elucidate molecular mechanisms of AD.  
25045405	Targeting the proper amyloid-beta neuronal toxins: a path forward for Alzheimer's disease immunotherapeutics.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140709 2014
Levels of amyloid-beta monomer and deposited amyloid-beta in the Alzheimer's disease brain are orders of magnitude greater than soluble amyloid-beta oligomer levels. Monomeric amyloid-beta has no known direct toxicity. Insoluble fibrillar amyloid-beta has been proposed to be an in vivo mechanism for removal of soluble amyloid-beta and exhibits relatively low toxicity. In contrast, soluble amyloid-beta oligomers are widely reported to be the most toxic amyloid-beta form, both causing acute synaptotoxicity and inducing neurodegenerative processes. None of the amyloid-beta immunotherapies currently in clinical development selectively target soluble amyloid-beta oligomers, and their lack of efficacy is not unexpected considering their selectivity for monomeric or fibrillar amyloid-beta (or both) rather than soluble amyloid-beta oligomers. Because they exhibit acute, memory-compromising synaptic toxicity and induce chronic neurodegenerative toxicity and because they exist at very low in vivo levels in the Alzheimer's disease brain, soluble amyloid-beta oligomers constitute an optimal immunotherapeutic target that should be pursued more aggressively.  
24510744	Extracting and summarizing white matter hyperintensities using supervised segmentation methods in Alzheimer's disease risk and aging studies.
Hum Brain Mapp 20140207 2014Aug
Precise detection and quantification of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) observed in T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is of substantial interest in aging, and age-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is mainly because WMH may reflect co-morbid neural injury or cerebral vascular disease burden. WMH in the older population may be small, diffuse, and irregular in shape, and sufficiently heterogeneous within and across subjects. Here, we pose hyperintensity detection as a supervised inference problem and adapt two learning models, specifically, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, for this task. Using texture features engineered by texton filter banks, we provide a suite of effective segmentation methods for this problem. Through extensive evaluations on healthy middle-aged and older adults who vary in AD risk, we show that our methods are reliable and robust in segmenting hyperintense regions. A measure of hyperintensity accumulation, referred to as normalized effective WMH volume, is shown to be associated with dementia in older adults and parental family history in cognitively normal subjects. We provide an open source library for hyperintensity detection and accumulation (interfaced with existing neuroimaging tools), that can be adapted for segmentation problems in other neuroimaging studies.

25045372	Sleep problems associated with behavioral and psychological symptoms as well as cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease.
J Clin Neurol 20140703 2014Jul
It has been shown that sleep problems in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with cognitive impairment and behavioral problems. In fact, most of studies have founded that daytime sleepiness is significantly correlated with cognitive decline in AD. However, a few studies have also shown that nighttime sleep problems are associated with cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in AD. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nighttime sleep on cognition and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in AD. The study population comprised 117 subjects: 63 AD patients and 54 age- and sex-matched non-demented elderly subjects. Detailed cognitive functions and behavioral symptoms were measured using the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB) and the Korean version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-K). Sleep characteristics were evaluated using the Korean version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-K). The correlations between PSQI-K and SNSB scores and between PSQI-K and NPI-K scores were analyzed. In AD patients, sleep latency was found to be negatively correlated with praxis (p=0.041), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) immediate recall (p=0.041), and RCFT recognition (p=0.008) after controlling for age and education, while sleep duration and sleep efficiency were positively correlated with praxis (p=0.034 and p=0.025, respectively). Although no significant correlation was found between PSQI-K and NPI-K scores, sleep disturbance and total PSQI-K scores were found to be significantly associated with apathy/indifference in AD. Sleep problems such as prolonged sleep duration, sleep latency, and poor sleep efficiency in AD patients were correlated with cognitive dysfunction, and especially frontal executive and visuospatial functions, and BPSD. These findings suggest that treatment of nighttime sleep problems might improve cognition and behavioral symptoms in AD patients. 
24819465	Decision trees for the analysis of genes involved in Alzheimer×³s disease pathology.
J. Theor. Biol. 20140510 2014Sep21
Alzheimer×³s disease (AD) is characterized by a gradual loss of memory, orientation, judgement and language. There is still no cure for this disorder. AD pathogenesis remains fairly unknown and its underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Several studies have shown that the abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid and tau proteins occurs 10 to 20 years before the onset of symptoms of the disease, so it is extremely important to identify changes in the brain before the first symptoms. We used decision trees to classify 31 individuals (9 healthy controls and 22 AD patients in three different stages of disease) according to the expression of 69 genes previously reported in a meta-analysis, plus the expression levels of APP, APOE, BACE1, NCSTN, PSEN1, PSEN2 and MAPT. We also included in our analysis the MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) scores and number of NFT (neurofibrillary tangles). Results allowed us to generate a model of classification values for different AD stages of severity, according to MMSE scores, and achieve the identification of the expression level of protein tau that may possibly determine the onset (incipient stage) of AD. We used decision trees to model the different stages of AD (severe, moderate, incipient and control) based on the meta-analysis of gene expression levels plus MMSE and NFT scores. Both classifiers reported the variable MMSE as most informative, however it we were found that the protein tau also an important role in the onset of AD. 
24662099	Pharmacological Modulation of GSAP Reduces Amyloid-Î² Levels and Tau Phosphorylation in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease with Plaques and Tangles.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and an important player in its clinical manifestations. Formation of AÎ² is controlled by the availability of an enzyme called Î³-secretase. Despite its blockers being attractive therapeutic tools for lowering AÎ², this approach has failed because of their serious toxic side-effects. The discovery of the Î³-secretase activating protein (GSAP), a co-factor for this protease which facilitates AÎ² production without affecting other pathways responsible for the toxicity, is giving us the opportunity to develop a safer anti-AÎ² therapy. In this study we have characterized the effect of Imatinib, an inhibitor of GSAP, in the 3Ã—Tg mice, a mouse model of AD with plaques and tangles. Compared with controls, mice receiving the drug had a significant reduction in brain AÎ² levels and deposition, but no changes in the steady state levels of AÎ²PP, BACE-1, ADAM-10, or the four components of the Î³-secretase complex. By contrast, Imatinib-treated animals had a significant increase in CTF-Î² and a significant reduction in GSAP expression levels. Additionally, we observed that tau phosphorylation was reduced at specific epitopes together with its insoluble fraction. In vitro studies confirmed that Imatinib prevents AÎ² formation by modulating Î³-secretase activity and GSAP levels. Our findings represent the first in vivo demonstration of the biological role that GSAP plays in the development of the AD-like neuropathologies. They establish this protein as a viable target for a safer anti-AÎ² therapeutic approach in AD.  
24670395	Combination of MRI Hippocampal Volumetry and Arterial Spin Labeling MR Perfusion at 3-Tesla Improves the Efficacy in Discriminating Alzheimer's Disease from Cognitively Normal Elderly Adults.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Structural magnetic resonance imaging has been employed for evaluation of medial temporal atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique could detect cerebral perfusion abnormalities in AD. We hypothesized that combination of hippocampal volumetry and cerebral blood flow yield higher accuracy than either method alone in discriminating AD patients from cognitively normal elderly adults. 13 AD patients and 15 healthy controls were studied using a 3-tesla scanner. Standardized T1W 3D volumetric Fast Field Echo and QUASAR ASL sequences were employed for cerebral volumetry and perfusion respectively. Manual Right and left hippocampal volumetry was performed manually by ANALYZE software, with total intracranial volume normalization. ASL data were analyzed by institutional specially-design software to calculate cerebral blood flow of region-of-interests placed at the middle and posterior cingulate gyri. Right and left hippocampal volumes and middle and posterior cingulate gyri cerebral blood flows were significantly lower in the patients than in the controls (independent-samples t-tests, p &lt; 0.05), and prediction accuracies of 89.3%, 82.1%, 75.0% and 71.4% were achieved for each of the above parameters, respectively. In distinguishing patients from controls using corresponding optimized cut-off values, various combinations of these parameters were used to create the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. The highest area under curve value was 0.944, by combining cerebral blood flow at the middle cingulate gyrus, normalized right and left hippocampal volumes. A 'one-stop-shop' magnetic resonance study of combined hippocampal volumetry and cerebral perfusion has improved efficacy in discriminating AD patients from cognitively normal elderly adults. 
24685629	Increased hippocampal blood flow in sedentary older adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreases with age; however regulatory increases in hippocampal CBF have been associated with genetic risk (Apolipoprotein E [APOE] Îµ4 carriers) for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although physical activity exerts beneficial effects on CBF in healthy elderly, the effects of sedentary behaviors on CBF remain unknown. We measured resting hippocampal CBF (via arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging) and sedentary time/physical activity (via accelerometry) on 33 cognitively healthy adults (ages 52-81), 9 of which were APOE Îµ4 carriers. Results indicate that the relationship between sedentary time and CBF in the left hippocampus differs by APOE status, whereby APOE Îµ4 carriers show higher CBF as a function of longer sedentary time (B = 10.8, SE = 3.17, Î² = 0.74, t = 3.41, p &lt; 0.01) compared to noncarriers (B = 1.4, SE = 2.7, Î² = 0.096, t = 0.51, p = 0.61), possibly suggesting a CBF regulatory response to compensate for metabolic alterations in dementia risk. These preliminary data suggest that the relationship between CBF and sedentary time is different in APOE Îµ4 carriers and noncarriers and that sedentary time may act as a behavioral risk factor for CBF dysregulation in those at genetic risk for developing AD. More research is needed to further understand the role of sedentary behaviors and physical activity on CBF, especially in individuals at genetic risk of developing AD.  
24685633	Age-dependent increment of hydroxymethylation in the brain cortex in the triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder whose etiology is associated with environmental and genetic factors. Recently there have been several attempts to analyze the role of epigenetic alterations in the origin and progression of this neurodegenerative condition. To evaluate the potential participation of the methylation status of the genome that may contribute to AD progression, we have studied the levels and distribution of the 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in different brain regions at different ages. We analyzed and quantified the immunosignal of these two epigenetic marks in young versus old wild-type mice and in the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD). The results show a decline in global 5-methylcytosine mark over time in all studied brain regions concomitant with a significant and widespread increase in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine mark in the aged transgenic mice in contrast to the age-matched controls. These differences in the methylation pattern of brain DNA in the 3xTg-AD that accumulates along age indicates abnormal formation of permissive chromatin structure associated with the increase in AD-related markers.  
24685634	Apolipoprotein C-III is an Amyloid-Î²-Binding Protein and an Early Marker for Alzheimer's Disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
It has been demonstrated that peripheral injection of anti-amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) antibodies to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD transgenic mice facilitate AÎ² clearance. We hypothesized that peripheral circulating AÎ²-binding proteins also possess the ability to enhance AÎ² clearance and the levels of circulating AÎ²-binding proteins could serve as early AD biomarkers. Circulating AÎ²-binding proteins were isolated from plasma and identified by LC-MS/MS. Their levels were compared among non-demented individuals without AD family history (ND), with AD family history (ND-FH), and patients with mild AD. The results showed that most of the identified AÎ²-binding proteins were apolipoproteins, i.e., apoA-I, apoB-100, apoC-III, and apoE. AÎ² bound preferentially to apoA-I-enriched HDL, followed by apoC-III- and apoE-enriched VLDL, and bound less favorably to apoB-100-enriched LDL. Levels of apoA-I were reduced in AD patients and could be used to discriminate AD from ND groups (AUC: 0.93); whereas levels of apoC-III were reduced in both ND-FH and AD groups and could be used to differentiate ND-FH from ND individuals (AUC: 0.81). Both the levels of apoA-1 and apoC-III positively correlated with CASI and MMSE scores. In conclusion, these results suggest that plasma apoA-I could be a sensitive AD biomarker and individuals with low plasma levels of apoC-III are at risk for AD.  
24685637	Brain region-specific monoaminergic correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are present during the disease course of nearly all AD patients and consist of psychosis, agitation/aggression, and depression, among others. Given their detrimental consequences regarding life expectancy, cognition, and socio-economic costs, it is essential to elucidate their neurochemical etiology to facilitate the development of novel and effective pharmacotherapeutics. This study attempted to identify brain region-specific monoaminergic correlates of NPS by measuring the levels of eight monoamines and metabolites in nine relevant postmortem brain regions of 40 behaviorally characterized AD patients, i.e., dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), (nor)epinephrine and their respective metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), using RP-HPLC-ECD. Likewise, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score correlates of monoaminergic neurotransmitter alterations were calculated. As a result, MMSE scores, used as a measure of dementia severity, correlated positively with hippocampal 5-HIAA levels as well as with 5-HT levels of the superior temporal gyrus and cerebellar cortex. Furthermore, hippocampal 5-HIAA levels inversely correlated with agitation scores, whereas thalamic MHPG levels comparably did with the presence of hallucinations. Finally, in the cerebellar cortex, DOPAC/DA ratios, indicative of DA turnover, correlated with physically agitated behavior while MHPG levels correlated with affective disturbances. These findings support the assumption that specific NPS features in AD might be (in)directly related to brain region-specific monoaminergic neurotransmitter alterations. Additionally, the effect of AD pathology on neurochemical alterations in the cerebellum requires further examination due to its important but underestimated role in the neurochemical pathophysiology of NPS in AD.  
24705548	Validation of the AD-CSF-Index in Autopsy-Confirmed Alzheimer's Disease Patients and Healthy Controls.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-Î² peptide of 42 amino acids (AÎ²1-42), total tau-protein (T-tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181P) are used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to increase diagnostic power, several biomarker combinations have been proposed. In that sense, a new CSF biomarker index was developed, the AD-CSF-index, which has been validated in clinically diagnosed AD patients using electrochemoluminescence based Meso Scale Discovery and single-analyte ELISA kits. This study validated the AD-CSF-index in neuropathologically diagnosed AD patients, using both single-analyte ELISA and multi-analyte Luminex assays. CSF of 51 neuropathologically diagnosed AD patients and of 95 controls was analyzed by commercially available single-analyte ELISA-kits (INNOTESTÂ®, Innogenetics) and by a Research Use Only version of the multi-analyte Luminex xMAPÂ® assay (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, Innogenetics). Subsequently the AD-CSF-indices were calculated. Both T-tau and P-tau181P AD-CSF-indices were significantly increased in AD patients when compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). The diagnostic power of the indices was calculated using ROC analyses, resulting in excellent sensitivity and specificity values that systematically exceeded the 80% threshold for discriminating autopsy-confirmed AD patients from controls, independent of the analytical platform. The power to discriminate between AD and non-AD dementias was not included in this study and should be validated in the future. In conclusion, this study validated the AD-CSF-index in autopsy-confirmed AD patients and has shown that its excellent diagnostic accuracy is independent of the analytical platform.  
24718100	Cognitive and Neuroimaging Profiles in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: Data from the Spanish Multicenter Normative Studies (NEURONORMA Project).
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
The aim of this study was to characterize the neuropsychological and neuroimaging profiles of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and to study the magnitude of the differences by comparing both outcomes with healthy subjects in a cross-sectional manner. Five hundred and thirty-five subjects (356 cognitively normal adults (CONT), 79 MCI, and 100 AD) were assessed with the NEURONORMA neuropsychological battery. Thirty CONT, 23 MCI, and 23 AD subjects from this sample were included in the neuroimaging substudy. Patients' raw cognitive scores were converted to age and education-adjusted scaled ones (range 2-18) using co-normed reference values. Medians were plotted to examine the cognitive profile. MRIs were processed by means of FreeSurfer. Effect size indices (Cohen's d) were calculated in order to compare the standardized differences between patients and healthy subjects. Graphically, the observed cognitive profiles for MCI and AD groups produced near to parallel lines. Verbal and visual memories were the most impaired domains in both groups, followed by executive functions and linguistic/semantic ones. The largest effect size between AD and cognitively normal subjects was found for the FCSRT (d = 4.05, AD versus CONT), which doubled the value obtained by the best MRI measure, the right hippocampus (d = 1.65, AD versus CONT). Our results support the notion of a continuum in cognitive profile between MCI and AD. Neuropsychological outcomes, in particular the FCSRT, are better than neuroimaging ones at detecting differences among subjects.  
24718101	A Novel PSEN1 Mutation in a Patient with Sporadic Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease and Prominent Cerebellar Ataxia.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
PSEN1 gene mutations represent the first cause of familiar early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). More than 190 mutations in PSEN1 have been reported to date. The clinical phenotype is mainly characterized by cognitive decline but movement disorders have been rarely described. We report a novel PSEN1 mutation (p.Thr147Pro) responsible for a sporadic early-onset dementia with prominent cerebellar symptoms, resembling a spinocerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers examinations were performed on the patient, showing typical findings of EOAD and suggesting the pathogenicity of the novel mutation. Our study widens the number of unusual phenotypes related to PSEN1 mutations.  
24718104	Multivariate data analysis and machine learning in Alzheimer's disease with a focus on structural magnetic resonance imaging.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Machine learning algorithms and multivariate data analysis methods have been widely utilized in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research in recent years. Advances in medical imaging and medical image analysis have provided a means to generate and extract valuable neuroimaging information. Automatic classification techniques provide tools to analyze this information and observe inherent disease-related patterns in the data. In particular, these classifiers have been used to discriminate AD patients from healthy control subjects and to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD. In this paper, recent studies are reviewed that have used machine learning and multivariate analysis in the field of AD research. The main focus is on studies that used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but studies that included positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in addition to MRI are also considered. A wide variety of materials and methods has been employed in different studies, resulting in a range of different outcomes. Influential factors such as classifiers, feature extraction algorithms, feature selection methods, validation approaches, and cohort properties are reviewed, as well as key MRI-based and multi-modal based studies. Current and future trends are discussed.  
24898653	A nutritional approach to ameliorate altered phospholipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
Recently, a biomarker panel of 10 plasma lipids, including 8 phosphatidylcholine species, was identified that could predict phenoconversion from cognitive normal aged adults to amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) within 2-3 years with &gt;90% accuracy. The reduced levels of these plasma phospholipids could reflect altered phospholipid metabolism in the brain and periphery. We show that a 24-week nutritional intervention in drug-naÃ¯ve patients with very mild to mild AD significantly increased 5 of the 7 measured biomarker phosphatidylcholine species. By providing nutrients which normally rate-limit phospholipid synthesis, this nutritional intervention could be useful in asymptomatic subjects with a plasma lipid biomarker profile prognostic of AD.  
24936678	Radioiodinated Benzyloxybenzene Derivatives: A Class of Flexible Ligands Target to Î²-Amyloid Plaques in Alzheimer's Brains.
J. Med. Chem. 20140707 2014Jul24
Benzyloxybenzene, as a novel flexible scaffold without rigid planarity, was synthesized and evaluated as ligand toward AÎ² plaques. The binding site calculated for these flexible ligands was the hydrophobic Val18_Phe20 channel on the flat surface of AÎ² fiber. Structure-activity relationship analysis generated a common trend that binding affinities declined significantly from para-substituted ligands to ortho-substituted ones, which was also quantitatively illustrated by 3D-QSAR modeling. Autoradiography in vitro further confirmed the high affinities of radioiodinated ligands [(125)I]4, [(125)I]24, and [(125)I]22 (Ki = 24.3, 49.4, and 17.6 nM, respectively). In biodistribution, [(125)I]4 exhibited high initial uptake and rapid washout property in the brain with brain2Â min/brain60Â min ratio of 16.3. The excellent in vitro and in vivo biostability of [(125)I]4 enhanced its potential for clinical application in SPECT imaging of AÎ² plaques. This approach could also allow the design of a new generation of AÎ² targeting ligands without rigid and planar framework.  
24955552	Comparison of sertraline, venlafaxine and desipramine effects on depression, cognition and the daily living activities in Alzheimer patients.
Pharmacopsychiatry 20140623 2014Jul
The effects of antidepressants on mood, cognition and the daily activities of Alzheimer patients are ambiguous. The effects of antidepressants SSRIs (serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors), TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants) and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), in particular, are unknown. This study aimed to compare the effects of sertraline, venlafaxine and desipramine on depression, cognition and the daily activities of Alzheimer patients. This randomized double-blind trial was approved by the Research and Ethics Committees of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. 59 moderate Alzheimer patients with major depressive disorder were randomly divided into 3 groups (sertraline, venlafaxine and desipramine), treated for 12 weeks (150â€‰mg maximum dose) and assessed by the Hamilton Depression Test (HRSD), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Barthel index at the week 0 and the 2(nd), 4(th), 8(th), 12(th) weeks thereafter. Data were analyzed by SPSS software, using ANOVA and paired t-tests. In the sertraline group, the results of all 3 tests, HRSD, MMSE and Barthel, in the 12(th) week showed significant improvements in comparison to the baseline (P&lt;0.05 in all 3 tests). In the venlafaxine group, the results of MMSE and Barthel revealed significant improvements (P&lt;0.05 in both tests). In the desipramine group, there was a significant improvement only in the Barthel test at the 12(th) week (P&lt;0.05). In this trial, sertraline treatment was associated with superior effectiveness in relation to depressive, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. 
25055036	Base excision repair in Alzheimer's disease.
Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online) 20140722 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in people over 65 years of age. Estimates indicate that about 200 thousand Pole suffer from AD while in the world about 30 million people. Forecasts show that in developed countries the number of people with neurodegenerative diseases by 2025 will increase by several hundred percent compared to 1980. Results of carried out tests suggest several causes of this disease, in which an important role is played by age, genetic and environmental factors. An important role is played by oxidizing agents. They damage the genetic material and reduce activity of enzymes responsible for the repair of this damage contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases including AD. In this paper we discuss the relationship between the activity level of the main system removing oxidative DNA damage, named base excision repair (BER), which recognizes and repairs damaged DNA bases, as well as the key proteins involved in this type of DNA repair and AD. We also describe the important role of genetic polymorphism in genes encoding BER proteins, modulating the activity of this type of repair. This indicates the possibility to increase the knowledge of the AD mechanism based on the BER system, which may contribute to the identification of molecular markers of this disease in the future.  
25055064	Spatial distribution of deaths due to Alzheimer's disease in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
Sao Paulo Med J  2014Jul
Alzheimer's disease is a common cause of dementia and identifying possible spatial patterns of mortality due to this disease may enable preventive actions. The objective of this study was to identify spatial distribution patterns of mortality due to Alzheimer's disease in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. Ecological and exploratory study conducted in all municipalities in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. Data on Alzheimer's disease mortality in the state of SÃ£o Paulo between 2004 and 2009 were obtained from DATASUS (the Department of Informatics in the Brazilian Ministry of Health). Death rates per 100,000 inhabitants were then calculated and spatial analysis was performed by constructing a death rate map, global Moran index and local Moran index, which were used to obtain the Moran map. The kernel technique was also applied. The Terra View 4.0.0 software was used. 13,030 deaths due to Alzheimer were reported in the state of SÃ£o Paulo (rate of 5.33 deaths/100,000 inhabitants). SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, RibeirÃ£o Preto, Bauru and AraÃ§atuba had higher rates. The Moran index was I = 0.085 (P &lt; 0.002). The Moran map identified 42 municipalities that merit intervention and the kernel estimator identified a high density of deaths in the northwestern region of the state. Higher densities of deaths due to Alzheimer were concentrated more to the north and northwest of the state of SÃ£o Paulo. It was possible to identify municipalities that have priority for interventions to reduce the death rates due to this disease. 
23891457	Postural control and cognitive decline in older adults: position versus velocity implicit motor strategy.
Gait Posture 20130723 2014
The present study explored the impact of cognitive decline on postural control strategies in older adults with and without cognitive decline from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (MMAD). We hypothesized that the cognitive decline affected the postural control leading to higher bounding limits of COP velocity dynamics. Based on a cross-sectional design, 175 non-faller older adults were recruited in Angers University Hospital, France, including 50 cognitively healthy individuals [CHI] (mean age 76.42 Â± 4.84 years; 30% women), 64 age- and body mass index-matched participants with MCI (mean age 77.51 Â± 6.32 years; 39% women), and 61 age- and body mass index-matched participants with MMAD (mean age 78.44 Â± 3.97 years; 62% women). For all data collection of postural sway, the participants were asked to maintain quiet stance on force platform. The postural test consisted of two trials of quiet stance, with eyes open and with eyes closed. The COP parameters were mean and standard deviation (SD) of position, velocity and average absolute maximal velocity (AAMV) in antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions. Overall, the analysis concerning all COP parameters revealed a significant main effect of cognitive status on velocity-based variables, with post hoc comparisons evidencing that SD velocity and AAMV increased with cognitive impairment. The current findings suggest an active control (or corrective process) of COP velocity dynamics for CHI, whereas MCI and MMAD are affected by COP movements. 
23822823	Atherosclerosis, biomarkers of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Neurosci. 20130806 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, involving progressive deterioration of neuronal networks. Although the pathophysiological mechanism of AD is not fully elucidated, apart from Î²-amyloid and tau protein, a diverse number of factors such as cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, and lipids metabolism may play a significant role. Numerous epidemiological and laboratory studies support vascular injury and inflammation, as key pathological processes. The present review is focused on cardiovascular risk factors, lipids, and circulating biomarkers of inflammation, discussing them as independent mechanisms converging to the same final pathogenetic cascade of AD.  
24924665	Smoking and increased Alzheimer's disease risk: a review of potential mechanisms.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Jun
Cigarette smoking has been linked with both increased and decreased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is relevant for the US military because the prevalence of smoking in the military is approximately 11% higher than in civilians. A systematic review of published studies on the association between smoking and increased risk for AD and preclinical and human literature on the relationships between smoking, nicotine exposure, and AD-related neuropathology was conducted. Original data from comparisons of smoking and never-smoking cognitively normal elders on in vivo amyloid imaging are also presented. Overall, literature indicates that former/active smoking is related to a significantly increased risk for AD. Cigarette smoke/smoking is associated with AD neuropathology in preclinical models and humans. Smoking-related cerebral oxidative stress is a potential mechanism promoting AD pathology and increased risk for AD. A reduction in the incidence of smoking will likely reduce the future prevalence of AD. 
24924671	The critical need for defining preclinical biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Jun
The increasing number of afflicted individuals with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant emotional and financial burden on the world's population. Therapeutics designed to treat symptoms or alter the disease course have failed to make an impact, despite substantial investments by governments, pharmaceutical industry, and private donors. These failures in treatment efficacy have led many to believe that symptomatic disease, including both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, may be refractory to therapeutic intervention. The recent focus on biomarkers for defining the preclinical state of MCI/AD is in the hope of defining a therapeutic window in which the neural substrate remains responsive to treatment. The ability of biomarkers to adequately define the at-risk state may ultimately allow novel or repurposed therapeutic agents to finally achieve the disease-modifying status for AD. In this review, we examine current preclinical AD biomarkers and suggest how to generalize their use going forward.  
24924673	Effects of traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress disorder on Alzheimer's disease in veterans, using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Jun
Both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common problems resulting from military service, and both have been associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia resulting from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other causes. This study aims to use imaging techniques and biomarker analysis to determine whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or PTSD resulting from combat or other traumas increase the risk for AD and decrease cognitive reserve in Veteran subjects, after accounting for age. Using military and Department of Veterans Affairs records, 65 Vietnam War veterans with a history of moderate or severe TBI with or without PTSD, 65 with ongoing PTSD without TBI, and 65 control subjects are being enrolled in this study at 19 sites. The study aims to select subject groups that are comparable in age, gender, ethnicity, and education. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia are being excluded. However, a new study just beginning, and similar in size, will study subjects with TBI, subjects with PTSD, and control subjects with MCI. Baseline measurements of cognition, function, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; magnetic resonance images (structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state blood-level oxygen dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging); and amyloid positron emission tomographic (PET) images with florbetapir are being obtained. One-year follow-up measurements will be collected for most of the baseline procedures, with the exception of the lumbar puncture, the PET imaging, and apolipoprotein E genotyping. To date, 19 subjects with TBI only, 46 with PTSD only, and 15 with TBI and PTSD have been recruited and referred to 13 clinics to undergo the study protocol. It is expected that cohorts will be fully recruited by October 2014. This study is a first step toward the design and statistical powering of an AD prevention trial using at-risk veterans as subjects, and provides the basis for a larger, more comprehensive study of dementia risk factors in veterans.  
24281128	Association study of cathepsin D gene polymorphism in Iranian patients with sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131123 2014
One of the most prevalent forms of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Complex inheritance and multifactorial patterns of late-onset AD (LOAD) along with its heterogeneity are due to the presence of different AD-predisposing genes with different influence on disease development among various populations. A key event in the pathogenesis of AD is the deposition of Î²-amyloid peptide, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein by Î²- and Î³-secretases. Cathepsin D (CTSD) is an acid protease with Î²- and Î³-secretase-like features in vitro. An exonic Câ†’T polymorphism at position 224 of the CTSD gene (rs: 17571) has been shown to be associated with the enzyme function of CTSD and with AD. Two studies in the German population reported a strong association of this polymorphism with an increased risk of developing AD, while other studies did not confirm this observation. We tested for this association in a case-control study in 100 Iranian sporadic LOAD patients based on diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV-TR and NINCDS-ADRDA and in 100 normal controls without any personal and family history of AD or other related dementias. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was set up to detect this polymorphism. Our study demonstrated that T-carrying genotype frequency in AD patients is significantly higher than in controls and there was a 2.5-fold increased risk for developing AD in the T-carrying genotype compared to C/C genotype (odds ratio = 2.5, p = 0.010). The odds ratio for subjects with the apolipoprotein E Îµ4 (APOE Îµ4) allele was 2.91 (p = 0.003) and carriers of the CTSD T and APOE Îµ4 alleles had a 6.25-fold increased risk of the disease (p = 0.0). Our results indicate that CTSD genotype is associated with the disease and a combination of the above risk factors significantly alters the risk for developing AD. 
24356537	Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease associated with dementia using cerebral perfusion SPECT.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131214 2014
Since patterns of cognitive dysfunction in mild Parkinson's disease associated with dementia (PDD) are similar to those in mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is difficult to accurately differentiate between these two types of dementia in their early phases using neuropsychological tests. The purpose of the current study was to investigate differences in cerebral perfusion patterns of patients with AD and PDD at the earliest stages using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We consecutively recruited 31 patients with mild PDD, 32 patients with mild probable AD and 33 age-matched healthy subjects. All subjects underwent (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime perfusion SPECT and completed general neuropsychological tests. We found that both mild PDD and AD patients showed distinct hypoperfusion in frontal, parietal and temporal regions, compared with healthy subjects. More importantly, hypoperfusion in occipital and cerebellar regions was observed only in mild PDD. The observation of a significant decrease in cerebral perfusion in occipital and cerebellar regions in patients with mild PDD is likely useful to differentiate between PDD and AD at the earliest stages. 
24401901	Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in clinical subtypes of early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131231 2014
Accurate diagnosis of sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) can be challenging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers may assist in this process. We compared CSF indices between three EOAD subtypes: amnestic, logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). We identified 21 amnestic EOAD, 20 LPA, and 12 PCA patients with CSF data, which included amyloid Î²1-42 (AÎ²42), total tau (t-tau), phospho-tau181 (p-tau), and AÎ²42/t-tau index (ATI) levels. AÎ²42 and ATI levels were similar across groups, but t-tau and p-tau levels were significantly lower in PCA patients. The AÎ²42 and ATI data confirm the commonality of the AÎ² pathology in EOAD. The lower tau indices in PCA patients may reflect differences in the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles or rates of neurodegeneration. 
24481207	Risk factors for behavioral abnormalities in mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140125 2014
Behavioral symptoms are common in both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We analyzed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire data of 3,456 MCI and 2,641 mild AD National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database participants. Using factor analysis and logistic regression we estimated the effects of age, sex, race, education, Mini-Mental State Examination, functional impairment, marital status and family history on the presence of behavioral symptoms. We also compared the observed prevalence of behavioral symptoms between amnestic and nonamnestic MCI. Four factors were identified: affective behaviors (depression, apathy and anxiety); distress/tension behaviors (irritability and agitation); impulse control behaviors (disinhibition, elation and aberrant motor behavior), and psychotic behaviors (delusions and hallucinations). Male gender was significantly associated with all factors. Younger age was associated with a higher prevalence of distress/tension, impulse control and psychotic behaviors. Being married was protective against psychotic behaviors. Lower education was associated with the presence of distress/tension behaviors. Caucasians showed a higher prevalence of affective behaviors. Functional impairment was strongly associated with all behavioral abnormalities. Amnestic MCI patients had more elation and agitation relative to nonamnestic MCI patients. Younger age, male gender and greater functional impairment were associated with higher overall presence of behavioral abnormalities in MCI and mild AD. Marital status, lower education and race had an effect on selected behaviors. 
24481220	Speech in Alzheimer's disease: can temporal and acoustic parameters discriminate dementia?
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140130 2014
The study explores how speech measures may be linked to language profiles in participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and how these profiles could distinguish AD from changes associated with normal aging. We analysed simple sentences spoken by older adults with and without AD. Spectrographic analysis of temporal and acoustic characteristics was carried out using the Praat software. We found that measures of speech, such as variations in the percentage of voice breaks, number of periods of voice, number of voice breaks, shimmer (amplitude perturbation quotient), and noise-to-harmonics ratio, characterise people with AD with an accuracy of 84.8%. These measures offer a sensitive method of assessing spontaneous speech output in AD, and they discriminate well between people with AD and healthy older adults. This method of evaluation is a promising tool for AD diagnosis and prognosis, and it could be used as a dependent measure in clinical trials. 
24556708	Diagnostic validity of the Alzheimer's disease functional assessment and change scale in mild cognitive impairment and mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140218 2014
The Alzheimer's Disease Functional Assessment and Change Scale (ADFACS) is a functional assessment instrument widely used in clinical research. To test the diagnostic and concurrent validity of the Spanish version of this scale and to describe the functional deficit pattern for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The ADFACS, the Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia (IDDD), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered to 146 control subjects (CS) and 165 patients (67 MCI and 98 AD). Nonparametric tests were used to compare the diagnostic groups. Cronbach's Î± and correlations with the MMSE and the IDDD were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were studied. The ADFACS had a high internal consistency (Î± = 0.95). Three cutoff points of 1, 4, and 17 were provided to separate CS and MCI patients, MCI and mild AD patients, and mild AD and moderate AD patients, respectively. The ADFACS strongly correlated with functional (IDDD, 0.927) and cognitive (MMSE, 0.747) measures. A similar pattern of dysfunction, but in different grades, was found for the MCI and AD groups. The ADFACS is a reliable, valid, and sensitive instrument to assess functional abilities; it is useful in dementia assessment for elderly populations. 
23672944	Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease is associated with frontal metabolic impairment and accelerated decline in working memory: findings from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130315 2014Jul
An ascendant body of evidence suggests that Alzheimer disease with psychosis (AD+P) is a distinct variant of illness with its own genetic diathesis and a unique clinical course. Impaired frontal lobe function has been previously implicated in AD+P. The current exploratory study, presented in two parts, evaluates both the regional brain metabolic and psychometric correlates of psychosis in a longitudinal sample of subjects with AD, made available by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In Part 1 of the study, 21 ADNI participants with AD who developed psychotic symptoms during the study but were not psychotic at baseline were matched with 21 participants with AD who never became psychotic during the study period, and mean brain [F(18)]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) Cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) by regions of interest (ROIs) were compared Additionally, 39 participants with active psychosis at the time of image acquisition were matched with 39 participants who were never psychotic during the study period, and mean brain FDG-PET CMRgl by sROI were compared. In Part 2 of the study, 354 ADNI participants with AD who were followed for 24 months with serial psychometric testing were identified, and cognitive performance and decline were evaluated for correlation with psychotic symptoms. Part 1: There were no regional brain metabolic differences between those with AD destined to become psychotic and those who did not become psychotic. There was a significant reduction in mean orbitofrontal brain metabolism in those with active psychosis. Part 2: Over the course of study follow-up, psychosis was associated with accelerated decline in functional performance as measured by the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and Forward Digit Span. In a sample drawn from the ADNI dataset, our exploratory FDG-PET findings and longitudinal cognitive outcomes support the hypofrontality model of AD+P. Focal frontal vulnerability may mediate the accelerated decline seen in AD+P. 
24785550	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of donepezil for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol 20140430 2014Jul
Donepezil is a highly selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and one of the only four drugs currently approved for treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Providing high bioavailability and a very long half-time, donepezil is regarded as effective and well tolerable in Alzheimer's disease patients, even in difficult clinical conditions such as hepatic or renal impairment. It moderately improves cognitive and global functioning scores in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease over the course of 6 - 12 months, with open-label extension studies suggesting effects of even longer duration. We summarized relevant pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, clinical trial and neuroimaging data of donepezil. A literature search was performed in the PubMed database; articles published until October 2013 have been considered for this review. Moreover, references from original work and reviews have been searched for further relevant literature. Donepezil is one of the most frequently prescribed anti-dementia drugs. The recent additional approval of the 23 mg formulation will expand its use in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. After numerous Phase III study failures of novel disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease, donepezil is likely going to stay a first-line therapeutic option in Alzheimer's disease in the upcoming years. 
24858858	Early induction of oxidative stress in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with heme oxygenase activity.
Mol Med Rep 20140520 2014Aug
Evidence suggests that brain tissues of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are easily attacked by oxidative stress, and numerous studies indicate that heme oxygenase (HO) is a major cell adaptive responder to stress. However, whether HOâ€‘1 and HOâ€‘2 play different roles in this process has not yet been studied. In the present study, it was shown in an AD model that HOâ€‘1 and HOâ€‘2 have different roles in the early stages of AD. Learning and memory ability was tested in APPswe/PS1Î”E9 (APP/PS1) transgenic and wildâ€‘type mice using the Morris water maze. Î²â€‘amyloid plaques were measured using immunofluorescence staining. Changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the hippocampi were measured using a fluorescence technique. The results indicated that the escape latency, amyloid plaque deposition and ROS production increased in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 transgenic mice compared with wildâ€‘type mice. Furthermore, using doubleâ€‘immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis, it was found that the expression of HOâ€‘1 and HOâ€‘2 increased in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice and, notably, HOâ€‘2 was also found to be overexpressed in astrocytes. Little difference was observed in the plasma HOâ€‘1 concentrations between the two groups, while the plasma HOâ€‘2 concentration of the APP/PS1 mice was lower than that of the wildâ€‘type mice, shown by ELISA. In conclusion, HOâ€‘2 overexpression is an early event and plays a more critical role in the progression of AD.  
24859152	Tanshinone IIA reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting iNOS, MMPâ€‘2 and NFâ€‘ÎºBp65 transcription and translation in the temporal lobes of rat models of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol Med Rep 20140520 2014Aug
Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), one of the major active constituents of the medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been reported to possess neuroprotective effects against the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. To examine the effect of Tan IIA on AD, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, inÂ vivo animal experiments and inÂ vitro molecular biology investigations were employed in the present study. Firstly, a rat model of AD was successfully established by direct injection of the amyloid beta protein (AÎ²) and then these rats were administered an interventional treatment of Tan IIA. The learning and memory ability of rats was evaluated in four groups (Control, Sham, AD and Tan IIA) utilizing a Morris water maze test. Quantitative (q)PCR was employed to detect the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), matrix metalloproteinaseâ€‘2 (MMPâ€‘2) and nuclear transcription factor kappa (NFâ€‘ÎºBp65) in temporal lobe tissues and protein expression was determined with western blot analysis. In addition, association analyses between iNOS, MMPâ€‘2 and NFâ€‘ÎºBp65 at a transcriptional and translational level were performed utilizing Spearman's correlation analysis. In the present study, the results revealed that rats in the AD group demonstrated significant disruptions in learning and memory ability, and the symptoms were evidently reduced by Tan IIA. Furthermore, the upregulation of iNOS, MMPâ€‘2 and NFâ€‘ÎºBp65 at a transcriptional and translational level in AD rats was distinctly inhibited by Tan IIA. Therefore, it was concluded that iNOS, MMPâ€‘2 and NFâ€‘ÎºBp65 are involved in AD development, and Tan IIA may reduce AD risk by inhibiting transcription and translation of these genes. Furthermore, the positive correlation of iNOS and MMPâ€‘2 with NFâ€‘ÎºBp65, respectively, provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that Tan IIA reduces AD risk by inhibiting iNOS and MMPâ€‘2 at a transcriptional and translational level through the NFâ€‘ÎºB pathway. In summary, Tan IIA is an effective neuroprotective agent for AD therapy, and iNOS, MMPâ€‘2 and NFâ€‘ÎºBp65 may be the potential molecular targets for manipulating this effect therapeutically.  
24338518	New brain reperfusion rehabilitation therapy improves cognitive impairment in mild Alzheimer's disease: a prospective, controlled, open-label 12-month study with NIRS correlates.
Aging Clin Exp Res 20131212 2014Aug
A large body of evidence indicates that cerebral hypoperfusion is one of the earliest signs in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the brain reperfusion rehabilitation therapy (BRRT) would improve verbal memory and learning and/or global cognitive impairment in mild AD. Using a prospective, controlled, open-label 12-month study, we enrolled 15 patients with mild AD, who underwent BRRT program (BRRT group), and 10 age-sex-matched mild AD patients, who received no treatment (control group). At baseline (T0), and at the end of the 3Â months (T3), 6Â months (T6) and 12Â months (T12) participants from both groups were given an evaluation, using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). In both groups by using near-infrared spectroscopy, at T0 and T12, we measured tissue oxygen saturation (TOI) on temporal-parietal and frontal cortex of both sides. Ten patients from the BRRT group and 10 from the control group completed the 12-month follow-up. At the end of rehabilitation protocol, a significant improvement of MMSE and RAVLT was observed in the BRRT group as compared to control group. At T12 compared to T0, a significant improvement of TOI on frontal cortex of both sides was observed in the BRRT group as compared to control group. BRRT improves verbal memory-learning and global cognitive impairment which are associated with increased TOI values on frontal cortex of both sides. 
24557811	Diagnosis disclosure and advance care planning in Alzheimer disease: opinions of a sample of Italian citizens.
Aging Clin Exp Res 20140221 2014Aug
In current Alzheimer disease (AD) research there is growing asymmetry between the modest benefits of the currently available treatments, in contrast to the possibility to diagnose AD early in its natural history. This complex situation brings along a number of important ethical issues about diagnosis disclosure and end-of-life decisions that need to be addressed. The principal aim of the study was to investigate the attitudes towards disclosure of a diagnosis of AD and disposition towards completion of advance care planning, in a sample of Italian citizens. A convenience sample of 1,111 Italian citizens recruited from a community hospital in Brescia were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with both yes/no and multiple choice format questions about AD. The majority of the sample (83Â %) wanted disclosure for themselves. Women and caregivers were significantly less likely to agree that their hypothetically afflicted relative should be informed of a diagnosis of AD. The majority of the sample (81Â %) was in favor of advance care planning completion, most of all younger participants and non-caregivers. Less than a third of the sample (24Â %) was aware of the existence a judicially appointed guardian for patients affected by dementia. The majority of the participants wanted a potential diagnosis of AD to be disclosed to them and to their relatives if they were to be afflicted. The utility of completion of advance care planning and designation of a judicially appointed guardian is frequently endorsed by the sample. 
24931125	The Ca(2+) sensor S100A1 modulates neuroinflammation, histopathology and Akt activity in the PSAPP Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
Cell Calcium 20140526 2014Aug
The contribution of the Ca(2+) sensor S100A1 to in vivo Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathobiology has not been elucidated although S100A1 regulates numerous cellular processes linked to AD. This study uses genetic ablation to ascertain the effects of S100A1 on neuroinflammation, beta-amyloid (AÎ²) plaque deposition and Akt activity in the PSAPP AD mouse model. PSAPP/S100A1(-/-) mice exhibited decreases in astrocytosis (GFAP burden), microgliosis (Iba1 burden) and plaque load/number when compared to PSAPP/S100A1(+/+) mice at six and twelve months of age. The presence of detectable S100A1 staining in human AD specimens is consistent with a detrimental gain of S100A1 function in AD. S100A1 ablation also reduced plaque associated and increased non-plaque associated PO4-Akt and PO4-GSK3Î² staining. S100A1Â·Akt complexes were undetectable in PC12 cells and AD brain tissue suggesting that S100A1 indirectly modulates Akt activity. In contrast, S100A1Â·RyR (ryanodine receptor) complexes were present in human/mouse AD brain and exhibited Ca(2+)-dependent formation in neuronal cells. This is the first direct demonstration of an S100A1Â· target protein complex in tissue/cells and identifies the RyR as a primary S100A1 target protein in the brain. Collectively, these data suggest that S100A1 inhibition may be a novel strategy for normalizing aberrant Ca(2+) signaling in AD.  
25051543	An optimal decisional space for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
IEEE Trans Biomed Eng  2014Aug
This paper proposes to combine MRI data with a neuropsychological test, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), as input to a multi-dimensional space for the classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it's prodromal stages-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) including amnestic MCI (aMCI) and nonamnestic MCI (naMCI). The decisional space is constructed using those features deemed statistically significant through an elaborate feature selection and ranking mechanism. FreeSurfer was used to calculate 55 volumetric variables, which were then adjusted for intracranial volume, age and education. The classification results obtained using support vector machines are based on twofold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs. The study included 59 AD, 67 aMCI, 56 naMCI, and 127 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The study shows that MMSE scores contain the most discriminative power of AD, aMCI, and naMCI. For AD versus CN, the two most discriminative volumetric variables (right hippocampus and left inferior lateral ventricle), when combined with MMSE scores, provided an average accuracy of 92.4% (sensitivity: 84.0%; specificity: 96.1%). MMSE scores are found to improve all classifications with accuracy increments of 8.2% and 12% for aMCI versus CN and naMCI versus CN, respectively. Results also show that brain atrophy is almost evenly seen on both sides of the brain for AD subjects, which is different from right-side dominance for aMCI and left-side dominance for naMCI. Furthermore, hippocampal atrophy is seen to be the most significant for aMCI, while Accumbens area and ventricle are most significant for naMCI.  
24796810	The amyloid-Î² degradation pattern in plasma--a possible tool for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140504 2014Jun24
Amyloid beta (AÎ²) is the main component of plaques, the central neuropathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AÎ² is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Î²- and Î³-secretase-mediated cleavages. A large number of AÎ² peptides are found in cerebrospinal fluid and these peptides are produced in specific metabolic pathways, which are important for diagnosis, in drug development and to explore disease pathogenesis. To investigate whether a similar pattern could be found also in blood samples, an immunoprecipitation (IP) based method for enrichment of AÎ² peptides from human plasma was developed. The peptides were analyzed using matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry for AÎ² profiling and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for MS quantification of AÎ²1-38, AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 using tripe quadrupole MS. Sixteen N- or C-terminally truncated AÎ² peptides were reproducibly detected in human plasma, of which 11 were verified by tandem MS. In a pilot study including 9 AD patients and 10 controls, where AÎ²1-38, AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 were quantified using SRM, no AD-associated change in plasma levels of the peptides were observed. Using MS-based measurement techniques, we show that several AÎ² peptides can be monitored in a single analysis and the developed methods have the potential to be used as a read out in clinical trials of drugs affecting APP processing or AÎ² homeostasis. 
24914549	Changes in QTc interval in the citalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (CitAD) randomized trial.
PLoS ONE 20140610 2014
A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety communication in August 2011 warned that citalopram was associated with a dose dependent risk of QT prolongation and recommended dose restriction in patients over the age of 60 but did not provide data for this age group. CitAD was a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants were assigned to citalopram (target dose of 30 mg/day) or placebo in a 1 âˆ¶ 1 ratio. 186 people, 181 of whom were over the age of 60, having probable AD with clinically significant agitation were recruited from September 2009 to January 2013. After the FDA safety communication about citalopram, ECG was added to the required study procedures before enrollment and repeated at week 3 to monitor change in QTc interval. Forty-eight participants were enrolled after enhanced monitoring began. Citalopram treatment was associated with a larger increase in QTc interval than placebo (difference in week 3 QTc adjusting for baseline QTc: 18.1 ms [95% CI: 6.1, 30.1]; p = 0.004). More participants in the citalopram group had an increase â‰¥ 30 ms from baseline to week 3 (7 in citalopram versus 1 in placebo; Fisher's exact p = 0.046), but only slightly more in the citalopram group met a gender-specific threshold for prolonged QTc (450 ms for males; 470 ms for females) at any point during follow-up (3 in citalopram versus 1 in placebo, Fisher's exact p = 0.611). One of the citalopram participants who developed prolonged QTc also displayed ventricular bigeminy. No participants in either group had a cardiovascular-related death. Citalopram at 30 mg/day was associated with improvement in agitation in patients with AD but was also associated with QT prolongation. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00898807. 
24918775	Maternal high-fat diet worsens memory deficits in the triple-transgenic (3xTgAD) mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140611 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not normally diagnosed until later in life, although evidence suggests that the disease starts at a much earlier age. Risk factors for AD, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity, are known to have their affects during mid-life, though events very early in life, including maternal over-nutrition, can predispose offspring to develop these conditions. This study tested whether over-nutrition during pregnancy and lactation affected the development of AD in offspring, using a transgenic AD mouse model. Female triple-transgenic AD dam mice (3xTgAD) were exposed to a high-fat (60% energy from fat) or control diet during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning (at 3 weeks of age), female offspring were placed on a control diet and monitored up until 12 months of age during which time behavioural tests were performed. A transient increase in body weight was observed in 4-week-old offspring 3xTgAD mice from dams fed a high-fat diet. However, by 5 weeks of age the body weight of 3xTgAD mice from the maternal high-fat fed group was no different when compared to control-fed mice. A maternal high-fat diet led to a significant impairment in memory in 2- and 12-month-old 3xTgAD offspring mice when compared to offspring from control fed dams. These effects of a maternal high-fat diet on memory were accompanied by a significant increase (50%) in the number of tau positive neurones in the hippocampus. These data demonstrate that a high-fat diet during pregnancy and lactation increases memory impairments in female 3xTgAD mice and suggest that early life events during development might influence the onset and progression of AD later in life.  
24919190	Epigenetic regulations of immediate early genes expression involved in memory formation by the amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer disease.
PLoS ONE 20140611 2014
We previously demonstrated that APP epigenetically regulates Egr1 expression both in cultured neurons and in vivo. Since Egr1 is an immediate early gene involved in memory formation, we wondered whether other early genes involved in memory were regulated by APP and we studied molecular mechanisms involved. By comparing prefrontal (PF) cortex from wild type (APP+/+) and APP knockout mice (APP-/-), we observed that APP down regulates expression of four immediate early genes, Egr1, c-Fos, Bdnf and Arc. Down regulation of Egr1, c-Fos and Bdnf transcription resulted from a decreased enrichment of acetylated histone H4 on the corresponding gene promoter. Further characterization of H4 acetylation at Egr1 and c-Fos promoters revealed increased acetylation of H4K5 and H4K12 residues in APP-/- mice. Whereas APP affected Egr1 promoter activity by reducing access of the CREB transcription factor, its effect on c-Fos appeared to depend on increased recruitment of HDAC2 histone deacetylase to the gene promoter. The physiological relevance of the epigenetic regulation of Egr1 and c-Fos gene transcription by APP was further analyzed following exposure of mice to novelty. Although transcription of Egr1 and c-Fos was increased following exposure of APP+/+ mice to novelty, such an induction was not possible in APP-/- mice with a high basal level of expression of these immediate early genes. Altogether, these results demonstrate that APP-mediated regulation of c-Fos and Egr1 by different epigenetic mechanisms is needed for their induction during exposure to novelty.  
24923570	Structural study of the microtubule-associated protein tau locus of Alzheimer's disease in Taiwan.
Biomed J  2014 May-Jun
Haplotype structure of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene is associated with various tauopathies in the Caucasian population. With the knowledge that the association between MAPT structure and disease may be distinct in different ethnics, we intend to investigate the haplotype structure of MAPT in Taiwanese and test it for association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). One hundred and eight AD patients and 108 sex- and-age matched healthy controls were recruited from the dementia outpatient clinic of Chang Gung Medical center. We genotyped the del-In9 marker that defines the extended H1 and H2 clades. We selected 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the extended MAPT region from Japanese SNPs database and dbSNP database. Using the software TagIt, we analyzed the linkage disequilibrium structure of MAPT and compared the allele and genotype distribution between patient group and control group. All the Taiwanese participants were H1 haplotypes. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed the haplotype blocks in Taiwanese population had a smaller size in comparison to that of the Caucasian population. Single locus association showed significant p value in one of the tagging variants (rs242557) in our Taiwanese AD case-control cohorts. MAPT gene has four haplotype blocks in the Taiwanese population, each of around 40 kbp. In both European study and our study, the SNP rs242557 showed association with AD. Given the position of this SNP, the most possible explanation is that genetic variability in tau expression contributes to the risk of developing AD. 
24924683	Prescribing drugs for Alzheimer's disease in primary care: managing cognitive symptoms.
Drug Ther Bull  2014Jun
There are currently no interventions that cure or even alter the progressive course of dementia. In the UK, donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are licensed for symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and memantine is licensed for use in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.1-4 These drugs improve cognitive function by a modest amount compared with placebo.5 Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) stipulates that such treatment should be initiated by a specialist, in many parts of the UK responsibility for continued prescription of these drugs is being transferred to primary care. Here we review the evidence for drugs prescribed for cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and highlight key issues for those who are prescribing them.  
24974662	Prevalence of anxiety and depression in caregivers of Alzeheimer's dementia patients.
Acta Clin Croat  2014Mar
Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, which affects 30 million people worldwide. With aging of the population, it is becoming an increasing problem in Croatia. Alzheimer's dementia represents not only problem for the patient but affects the patients' caregivers as well. Caring for a patient with AD carries a significant physical, socioeconomic and psychological burden. Previous studies have shown an increased risk of physical and psychiatric illness. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence and intensity of anxious and depressive symptoms in caregivers of AD patients treated at Vrapce University Psychiatric Hospital in Zagreb. The study included 30 caregivers of AD patients. Participants were included consecutively, during July and August 2010. The Croatian version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess the level of anxiety and depression in study participants. The mean level of anxiety and depression as measured by HADS was 10.46 +/- 4.26 and 8.03 +/- 4.08, respectively. A pathologic level of anxiety was found in 14 (46.7%) and pathologic level of depression as measured by HADS in 8 (26.7%) caregivers. This study showed that not only appropriate treatment of AD patients is necessary, but AD patient caregivers should also be provided due care and support. 
25031632	Interpreting Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in light of the effects on amyloid-Î².
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140312 2014
The failure of several potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutics in mid- to late-stage clinical development has provoked significant discussion regarding the validity of the amyloid hypothesis. In this review, we propose a minimum criterion of 25% for amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) lowering to achieve clinically meaningful slowing of disease progression. This criterion is based on genetic, risk factor, clinical and preclinical studies. We then compare this minimum criterion with the degree of AÎ² lowering produced by the potential therapies that have failed in clinical trials. If the proposed minimum AÎ² lowering criterion is used, then the amyloid hypothesis has yet to be adequately tested in the clinic. Therefore, we believe that the amyloid hypothesis remains valid and remains to be confirmed or refuted in future clinical trials.  
25031633	Perspectives on future Alzheimer therapies: amyloid-Î² protofibrils - a new target for immunotherapy with BAN2401 in Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140324 2014
The symptomatic drugs currently on the market for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have no effect on disease progression, and this creates a large unmet medical need. The type of drug that has developed most rapidly in the last decade is immunotherapy: vaccines and, especially, passive vaccination with monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are attractive drugs as they can be made highly specific for their target and often with few side effects. Data from recent clinical AD trials indicate that a treatment effect by immunotherapy is possible, providing hope for a new generation of drugs. The first anti-amyloid-beta (anti-AÎ²) vaccine developed by Elan, AN1792, was halted in phase 2 because of aseptic meningoencephalitis. However, in a follow-up study, patients with antibody response to the vaccine demonstrated reduced cognitive decline, supporting the hypothesis that AÎ² immunotherapy may have clinically relevant effects. Bapineuzumab (Elan/Pfizer Inc./Johnson &amp; Johnson), a monoclonal antibody targeting fibrillar AÎ², was stopped because the desired clinical effect was not seen. Solanezumab (Eli Lilly and Company) was developed to target soluble, monomeric AÎ². In two phase 3 studies, Solanezumab did not meet primary endpoints. When data from the two studies were pooled, a positive pattern emerged, revealing a significant slowing of cognitive decline in the subgroup of mild AD. The Arctic mutation has been shown to specifically increase the formation of soluble AÎ² protofibrils, an AÎ² species shown to be toxic to neurons and likely to be present in all cases of AD. A monoclonal antibody, mAb158, was developed to target AÎ² protofibrils with high selectivity. It has at least a 1,000-fold higher selectivity for protofibrils as compared with monomers of AÎ², thus targeting the toxic species of the peptide. A humanized version of mAb158, BAN2401, has now entered a clinical phase 2b trial in a collaboration between BioArctic Neuroscience and Eisai without the safety concerns seen in previous phase 1 and 2a trials. Experiences from the field indicate the importance of initiating treatment early in the course of the disease and of enriching the trial population by improving the diagnostic accuracy. BAN2401 is a promising candidate for AÎ² immunotherapy in early AD. Other encouraging efforts in immunotherapy as well as in the small-molecule field offer hope for new innovative therapies for AD in the future.  
25031641	Dietary regulation of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² pathway in Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140620 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of phosphorylated Tau. Several findings suggest that correcting signal dysregulation for Tau phosphorylation in AD may offer a potential therapeutic approach. The PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² pathway has been shown to play a pivotal role in neuroprotection, enhancing cell survival by stimulating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. This pathway appears to be crucial in AD because it promotes protein hyper-phosphorylation in Tau. Understanding those regulations may provide a better efficacy of new therapeutic approaches. In this review, we summarize advances in the involvement of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² pathways in cell signaling of neuronal cells. We also review recent studies on the features of several diets and the signaling pathway involved in AD.  
25031637	Is pathological aging a successful resistance against amyloid-beta or preclinical Alzheimer's disease?
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140506 2014
Individuals with pathological aging, a form of cerebral amyloidosis in older people, have widespread extracellular amyloid-beta (AÎ²) senile plaque deposits in the setting of limited neurofibrillary tau pathology. Unlike the characteristic finding of antemortem cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease patients, individuals with pathological aging usually lack cognitive impairment despite similar AÎ² senile plaque burdens. It has been hypothesized that protective or resistance factors may underlie pathological aging, thus minimizing or preventing deleterious effects on cognition. Despite increasing interest and recognition, a review of the literature remains challenging given the range of terms used to describe pathological aging. This debate briefly reviews neuropathologic and biochemical evidence that pathological aging individuals have resistance factors to AÎ² plaque pathology. Additionally, we will discuss evidence of pathological aging as an intermediate between normal individuals and Alzheimer's disease patients, and discuss protective or resistance factors against vascular disease and neurofibrillary pathology. Lastly, we will emphasize the need for longitudinal biomarker evidence using amyloid positron emission tomography, which will provide a better understanding of the kinetics of AÎ² deposition in pathological aging.  
25031647	Validation of the Thai QOL-AD version in Alzheimer's patients and caregivers.
Australas Med J 20140630 2014
Quality of life (QOL) plays an important role in determining the improvement of patient care in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The simple and easily used Thai instrument for measuring QOL is still limited. This study aimed to translate the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale original version into a Thai version and test its psychometric properties. A Thai version of QOL-AD was translated following the sequential method. The validation was tested in 136 pairs of patients and their caregivers. Mild to moderate Alzheimer's patients were recruited from outpatient clinics at Chiang Mai Neurological Hospital and Chiang Mai Psychiatry Hospital from April to September 2012. Internal consistency, factor analysis, and construct validity were evaluated. Internal consistency of Thai QOL-AD version was good for both patients (0.82) and caregivers (0.82). The results of factor analysis indicated three factors (physical and psychological well-being, social well-being, and close interpersonal relationships) in the patient group, while four factors were found (social well-being, functional ability, psychological well-being, and physical well-being) in the caregiver group. The scaling success in the patient group was around 80-83 per cent for convergent validity, and 70-83 per cent for discriminant validity. The caregiver group showed higher scaling success in convergent validity except for the psychological well-being domain. The scaling success of discriminant validity was around 44-83 per cent for caregivers. The findings of the study demonstrate a good reliability of a Thai QOL-AD version for both patient and caregiver groups. Validity, especially in the caregiver group, might need to be re-examined. 
25031536	Eye movement analysis and cognitive processing: detecting indicators of conversion to Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat 20140709 2014
A great amount of research has been developed around the early cognitive impairments that best predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is no longer considered to be an intermediate state between normal aging and AD, new paths have been traced to acquire further knowledge about this condition and its subtypes, and to determine which of them have a higher risk of conversion to AD. It is now known that other deficits besides episodic and semantic memory impairments may be present in the early stages of AD, such as visuospatial and executive function deficits. Furthermore, recent investigations have proven that the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobe structures are not only involved in memory functioning, but also in visual processes. These early changes in memory, visual, and executive processes may also be detected with the study of eye movement patterns in pathological conditions like MCI and AD. In the present review, we attempt to explore the existing literature concerning these patterns of oculomotor changes and how these changes are related to the early signs of AD. In particular, we argue that deficits in visual short-term memory, specifically in iconic memory, attention processes, and inhibitory control, may be found through the analysis of eye movement patterns, and we discuss how they might help to predict the progression from MCI to AD. We add that the study of eye movement patterns in these conditions, in combination with neuroimaging techniques and appropriate neuropsychological tasks based on rigorous concepts derived from cognitive psychology, may highlight the early presence of cognitive impairments in the course of the disease.  
24556849	Emergence of mild cognitive impairment in late middle-aged adults in the wisconsin registry for Alzheimer's prevention.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140220 2014
Aim: It is difficult to reliably detect the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cognitive impairment. Our aim was to compare 3 psychometric methods of identifying amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in a middle-aged longitudinal cohort enriched for AD risk. Methods: Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) participants with 3 waves of cognitive assessment over approximately 6 years were coded as meeting each of 3 psychometric aMCI definitions: (a) 'aMCI standard-baseline' used published norms to establish cutoffs for baseline performance; (b) 'aMCI robust-baseline' applied WRAP-specific robust norms to baseline, and (c) 'aMCI robust-multiwave' applied these robust norms across 3 waves of assessment. Each group was compared to a cognitively healthy subset. Results: Half the aMCI standard-baseline and one third of the aMCI robust-baseline group reverted to normal ranges at follow-up. Only the aMCI robust-multiwave method had an aMCI Ã— age interaction showing significantly worse age-related memory declines in the aMCI group compared to the cognitively healthy group over 6 years of follow-up. Conclusion: Both cross-sectional methods showed instability over time, with many reverting to normal performance after baseline. The multiwave approach identified a group who showed progressive memory declines over 3 visits. Being able to detect progressive decline in late middle age is a critical step in improving prevention efforts. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.  
24603498	Evaluation of emotional blunting in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia compared to Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140301 2014
Background: Emotional blunting is a major clinical feature of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Assessing the change in emotional blunting may facilitate the differential diagnosis of this disorder and can quantify a major source of distress for the patients' caregivers and families. Methods: We evaluated investigator ratings on the Scale for Emotional Blunting (SEB) for 13 patients with bvFTD versus 18 patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The caregivers also performed SEB ratings for both the patients' premorbid behavior (before dementia onset) and the patients' behavior on clinical presentation (after dementia onset). Results: Before the onset of dementia, the caregivers reported normal SEB scores for both dementia groups. After the onset of dementia, both caregivers and investigators reported greater SEB scores for the bvFTD patients compared to the AD patients. The patients were rated to be much more emotionally blunted by the bvFTD caregivers than by the investigators. A change of â‰¥15 in the caregiver SEB ratings suggests bvFTD. The change in caregiver SEB ratings was positively correlated with bifrontal hypometabolism on FDG-PET scans. Conclusions: Changes in the caregiver assessment of emotional blunting with dementia onset can distinguish patients with bvFTD from those with AD, and they may better reflect the impact of emotional blunting than similar assessments made by clinicians/investigators.

24443091	Shape abnormalities of subcortical and ventricular structures in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: Detecting, quantifying, and predicting.
Hum Brain Mapp 20140117 2014Aug
This article assesses the feasibility of using shape information to detect and quantify the subcortical and ventricular structural changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We first demonstrate structural shape abnormalities in MCI and AD as compared with healthy controls (HC). Exploring the development to AD, we then divide the MCI participants into two subgroups based on longitudinal clinical information: (1) MCI patients who remained stable; (2) MCI patients who converted to AD over time. We focus on seven structures (amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and lateral ventricles) in 754 MR scans (210 HC, 369 MCI of which 151 converted to AD over time, and 175 AD). The hippocampus and amygdala were further subsegmented based on high field 0.8 mm isotropic 7.0T scans for finer exploration. For MCI and AD, prominent ventricular expansions were detected and we found that these patients had strongest hippocampal atrophy occurring at CA1 and strongest amygdala atrophy at the basolateral complex. Mild atrophy in basal ganglia structures was also detected in MCI and AD. Stronger atrophy in the amygdala and hippocampus, and greater expansion in ventricles was observed in MCI converters, relative to those MCI who remained stable. Furthermore, we performed principal component analysis on a linear shape space of each structure. A subsequent linear discriminant analysis on the principal component values of hippocampus, amygdala, and ventricle leads to correct classification of 88% HC subjects and 86% AD subjects.

24453132	Genetic influence of apolipoprotein E4 genotype on hippocampal morphometry: An N = 725 surface-based Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative study.
Hum Brain Mapp 20140122 2014Aug
The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hippocampal volumes are generally smaller in AD patients carrying the e4 allele compared to e4 noncarriers. Here we examined the effect of APOE e4 on hippocampal morphometry in a large imaging database-the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We automatically segmented and constructed hippocampal surfaces from the baseline MR images of 725 subjects with known APOE genotype information including 167 with AD, 354 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 204 normal controls. High-order correspondences between hippocampal surfaces were enforced across subjects with a novel inverse consistent surface fluid registration method. Multivariate statistics consisting of multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance were computed for surface deformation analysis. Using Hotelling's T(2) test, we found significant morphological deformation in APOE e4 carriers relative to noncarriers in the entire cohort as well as in the nondemented (pooled MCI and control) subjects, affecting the left hippocampus more than the right, and this effect was more pronounced in e4 homozygotes than heterozygotes. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that showed e4 carriers exhibit accelerated hippocampal atrophy; we extend these findings to a novel measure of hippocampal morphometry. Hippocampal morphometry has significant potential as an imaging biomarker of early stage AD. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3903-3918, 2014. Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  
24793844	Animal models of Alzheimer disease: historical pitfalls and a path forward.
ALTEX 20140410 2014
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a medically and financially overwhelming condition, and incidence rates are expected to triple by 2050.Despite decades of research in animal models of AD, the disease remainsincompletely understood, with few treatment options. This review summarizes historical and current AD research efforts, with emphasis on the disparity between preclinical animal studies and the reality of human disease and how this has impacted clinical trials. Ultimately, we provide a mechanism for shifting the focus of AD research away from animal models to focus primarily on human biology as a means to improve the applicability of research findings to human disease. Implementation of these alternatives may hasten development of improved strategies to prevent, detect, ameliorate, and possibly cure this devastating disease.  
25000142	Interaction of Alzheimer's Î²-Amyloid Peptides with Cholesterol: Mechanistic Insights into Amyloid Pore Formation.
Biochemistry 20140711 2014Jul22
Brain cholesterol plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular mechanisms linking cholesterol to neurotoxicity have remained elusive for a long time, but recent data have allowed the identification of functional cholesterol-binding domains in several amyloidogenic proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we analyze the cholesterol binding properties of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) peptides and the impact of these interactions on amyloid pore formation. We show that although the cholesterol-binding domains of AÎ² peptides and of transmembrane precursor C99 are partially overlapping, they involve distinct amino acid residues, so that cholesterol has a greater affinity for AÎ² than for C99. Synthetic 22-35 and 25-35 fragments of AÎ² retained the ability of the full-length peptide 1-42 to bind cholesterol and to form zinc-sensitive, calcium-permeable amyloid pores in cultured neural cells. Studies with mutant peptides allowed the identification of key residues involved in cholesterol binding and channel formation. Cholesterol promoted the insertion of AÎ² in the plasma membrane, induced Î±-helical structuration, and forced the peptide to adopt a tilted topology that favored the oligomerization process. Bexarotene, an amphipathic drug currently considered as a potential candidate medication for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, competed with cholesterol for binding to AÎ² and prevented oligomeric channel formation. These studies indicate that it is possible to prevent the generation of neurotoxic oligomers by targeting the cholesterol-binding domain of AÎ² peptides. This original strategy could be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases that involve cholesterol-dependent toxic oligomers.  
24365184	Wnt/Î²-Catenin Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes a progressive decline of mental and cognitive processes such as memory, judgment and reasoning. We proposed earlier that a sustained loss of function of Wnt/Î²- catenin signaling components underlies the onset and progression of the disease. Here, we discuss recent data on the involvement of Wnt/b-catenin signaling on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, AÎ² peptide neurotoxicity, Ï„ phosphorylation, and modulation of Apolipoprotein E function in the brain. We conclude that several components of the cascade are actively engaged in the events leading to AD neuropathology and propose that compounds that mimic activation of this signaling cascade, such as lithium, should be considered for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's patients. In summary, data accumulated during the past decade confirm some important predictions of our hypothesis where components of this signaling cascade are actively engaged in the events leading to AD neuropathology and that compounds that mimic activation of this signaling cascade, such as lithium, should be considered for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's patients.  
24616437	Altered cytological parameters in buccal cells from individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Cytometry A 20140225 2014Aug
Previous studies have shown that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be reflective of the early stages of more pronounced neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a need for a minimally invasive and inexpensive diagnostic to identify those who exhibit cellular pathology indicative of MCI and AD risk so that they can be prioritized for primary preventative measures. The hypothesis was that a minimally invasive approach using cytological markers in isolated buccal mucosa cells can be used to identify individuals of both MCI and AD. An automated buccal cell assay was developed using laser scanning cytometry (LSC) to measure buccal cell type ratios, nuclear DNA content and shape, and neutral lipid content of buccal cells from clinically diagnosed AD (nâ€‰=â€‰13) and MCI (nâ€‰=â€‰13) patients prior to treatment compared to age- and gender-matched controls (nâ€‰=â€‰26). DNA content was significantly higher in all cell types in both MCI (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and AD (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) compared with controls mainly due to an increase in &gt;2N nuclei. Abnormal nuclear shape (circularity) was significantly increased in transitional cells in MCI (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) and AD (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) when compared to controls. In contrast, neutral lipid content (as measured by Oil red O "ORO" staining) of buccal cells was significantly lower in the MCI group (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) compared with the control group. The ratio of DNA content/ORO in buccal basal cells for both MCI and AD was significantly higher compared to the control group, with ratios for MCI being approximately 2.8-fold greater (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and AD approximately 2.3-fold greater (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) than the control group. Furthermore, there was a strong negative correlation between buccal cell DNA content and ORO content in the AD group (r(2) â€‰=â€‰0.75, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001) but not in MCI or controls. The changes in the buccal cell cytome observed in this study could prove useful as potential biomarkers in identifying individuals with an increased risk of developing MCI and eventually AD.

24155031	Cholesterol as a co-solvent and a ligand for membrane proteins.
Protein Sci. 20131118 2014Jan
As of mid 2013 a Medline search on "cholesterol" yielded over 200,000 hits, reflecting the prominence of this lipid in numerous aspects of animal cell biology and physiology under conditions of health and disease. Aberrations in cholesterol homeostasis underlie both a number of rare genetic disorders and contribute to common sporadic and complex disorders including heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. The corresponding author of this review and his lab stumbled only recently into the sprawling area of cholesterol research when they discovered that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) binds cholesterol, a topic covered by the Hans Neurath Award lecture at the 2013 Protein Society Meeting. Here, we first provide a brief overview of cholesterol-protein interactions and then offer our perspective on how and why binding of cholesterol to APP and its C99 domain (Î²-CTF) promotes the amyloidogenic pathway, which is closely related to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.  
24473733	Amyloid beta 1-42 and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid of renal failure patients for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Nephrol. 20140129 2014Apr
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AÎ²42, total tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are well-defined diagnostic markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). There has been no previous report of the use of these markers in the diagnosis of AD in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We would like to report our preliminary findings on these biomarkers in three patients with renal failure. One patient with a clinical diagnosis of AD showed elevated CSF tau, p-tau 181, and decreased AÎ²42 levels, within a similar range as in local Chinese AD patients without renal impairment. The other two delirious patients, who did not have a clinical diagnosis of AD, showed normal CSF biomarkers. We found that the diagnosis of AD with CSF biomarkers appears to be useful in renal failure patients. But our results need to be confirmed in a larger study, comparing these CSF biomarkers in AD vs. non-AD patients with concomitant CKD.  
24804776	Increased inflammatory response in cytomegalovirus seropositive patients with Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140507 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with increased local inflammation in the affected brain regions, and in some studies also with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is known to promote a more effector-oriented phenotype in the T-cell compartment, increasing with age. The aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AD patients and non-demented (ND) controls. Using a multiplex Luminex xMAP assay targeting GM-CSF, IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and TNF-Î±, cytokine profiles from PBMCs were analysed after stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, CMV pp65 peptide mix or amyloid Î² (AÎ²) protofibrils, respectively. CMV seropositive AD subjects presented with higher IFN-Î³ levels after anti-CD3/CD28 and CMV pp65 but not after AÎ² stimulation, compared to CMV seropositive ND controls. When analysing IFN-Î³ response to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation on a subgroup level, CMV seropositive AD subjects presented with higher levels compared to both CMV seronegative AD and CMV seropositive ND subjects. Taken together, our data from patients with clinically manifest AD suggest a possible role of CMV as an inflammatory promoter in AD immunology. Further studies of AD patients at earlier stages of disease, could provide better insight into the pathophysiology.  
24806295	Disrupted functional brain connectivity and its association to structural connectivity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140507 2014
Although anomalies in the topological architecture of whole-brain connectivity have been found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), our understanding about the progression of AD in a functional connectivity (FC) perspective is still rudimentary and few study has explored the function-structure relations in brain networks of AD patients. By using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), this study firstly investigated organizational alternations in FC networks in 12 AD patients, 15 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and 14 age-matched healthy aging subjects and found that all three groups exhibit economical small-world network properties. Nonetheless, we found a decline of the optimal architecture in the progression of AD, represented by a more localized modular organization with less efficient local information transfer. Our results also show that aMCI forms a boundary between normal aging and AD and represents a functional continuum between healthy aging and the earliest signs of dementia. Moreover, we revealed a dissociated relationship between the overall FC and structural connectivity (SC) in AD patients. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging tractography was used to map the structural network of the same individuals. The decreased FC-SC coupling may be indicative of more stringent and less dynamic brain function in AD patients. Our findings provided insightful implications for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of brain dysfunctions in aMCI and AD patients and demonstrated that functional disorders can be characterized by multimodal neuroimaging-based metrics.  
24619276	Comparing cerebral perfusion in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia: an ASL-MRI study.
J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 20140312 2014Jun
Emerging evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) share neurodegenerative mechanisms. We sought to directly compare cerebral perfusion in these two conditions using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI). In total, 17 AD, 20 PDD, and 37 matched healthy controls completed ASL and structural MRI, and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. Alzheimer's disease and PDD perfusion was analyzed by whole-brain voxel-based analysis (to assess absolute blood flow), a priori specified region of interest analysis, and principal component analysis (to generate a network differentiating the two groups). Corrections were made for cerebral atrophy, age, sex, education, and MRI scanner software version. Analysis of absolute blood flow showed no significant differences between AD and PDD. Comparing each group with controls revealed an overlapping, posterior pattern of hypoperfusion, including posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and occipital regions. The perfusion network that differentiated AD and PDD groups identified relative differences in medial temporal lobes (AD&lt;PDD) and right frontal cortex (PDD&lt;AD). In conclusion, the pattern of cerebral hypoperfusion is very similar in AD and PDD. This suggests closely linked mechanisms of neurodegeneration mediating the evolution of dementia in both conditions.  
24889999	Brain region's relative proximity as marker for Alzheimer's disease based on structural MRI.
BMC Med Imaging 20140602 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, incurable neurodegenerative disease and the most common type of dementia. It cannot be prevented, cured or drastically slowed, even though AD research has increased in the past 5-10 years. Instead of focusing on the brain volume or on the single brain structures like hippocampus, this paper investigates the relationship and proximity between regions in the brain and uses this information as a novel way of classifying normal control (NC), mild cognitive impaired (MCI), and AD subjects. A longitudinal cohort of 528 subjects (170 NC, 240 MCI, and 114 AD) from ADNI at baseline and month 12 was studied. We investigated a marker based on Procrustes aligned center of masses and the percentile surface connectivity between regions. These markers were classified using a linear discriminant analysis in a cross validation setting and compared to whole brain and hippocampus volume. We found that both our markers was able to significantly classify the subjects. The surface connectivity marker showed the best results with an area under the curve (AUC) at 0.877 (p&lt;0.001), 0.784 (p&lt;0.001), 0,766 (p&lt;0.001) for NC-AD, NC-MCI, and MCI-AD, respectively, for the functional regions in the brain. The surface connectivity marker was able to classify MCI-converters with an AUC of 0.599 (p&lt;0.05) for the 1-year period. Our results show that our relative proximity markers include more information than whole brain and hippocampus volume. Our results demonstrate that our proximity markers have the potential to assist in early diagnosis of AD. 
24123475	Functional connectivity changes differ in early and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Brain Mapp 20131005 2014Jul
At a similar stage, patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) have greater neocortical but less medial temporal lobe dysfunction and atrophy than the late-onset form of the disease (LOAD). Whether the organization of neural networks also differs has never been investigated. This study aims at characterizing basal functional connectivity (FC) patterns of EOAD and LOAD in two groups of 14 patients matched for disease duration and severity, relative to age-matched controls. All subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify atrophy and resting-state FC focusing on : the default mode network (DMN), found impaired in earlier studies on AD, and the anterior temporal network (ATN) and dorso-lateral prefrontal network (DLPFN), respectively involved in declarative memory and executive functions. Patterns of atrophy and cognitive impairment in EOAD and LOAD were in accordance with previous reports. FC within the DMN was similarly decreased in both EOAD and LOAD relative to controls. However, a double-dissociated pattern of FC changes in ATN and DLPFN was found. EOAD exhibited decreased FC in the DLPFN and increased FC in the ATN relative to controls, while the reverse pattern was found in LOAD. In addition, ATN and DLPFN connectivity correlated respectively with memory and executive performances, suggesting that increased FC is here likely to reflect compensatory mechanisms. Thus, large-scale neural network changes in EOAD and LOAD endorse both common features and differences, probably related to a distinct distribution of pathological changes. 
24129926	Plasma tau as a window to the brain-negative associations with brain volume and memory function in mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Brain Mapp 20131015 2014Jul
Neurofibrillary tangles are associated with cognitive dysfunction, and hippocampal atrophy with increased CSF tau markers. However, the plasma tau levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been well studied. We investigated plasma tau by using an immunomagnetic reduction assay in 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, 10 early AD dementia, and 30 healthy elders (HE). All received a 3D-brain MRI scan and a set of cognitive function test. We explored their relationships with both brain structure and cognitive functions. Images were analyzed to determine the brain volumes and gray matter densities. Patients with MCI or early AD had significantly increased plasma tau levels compared with HE. Plasma tau levels were negatively associated with the performance of logical memory, visual reproduction, and verbal fluency; also negatively associated with volume of total gray matter, hippocampus, amygdala; and gray matter densities of various regions. Regression analyses indicated that logical memory explained 0.394 and hippocampus volume predicted .608 of the variance of plasma tau levels, both P &lt; 0.001. Education years were negatively associated with the gray matter densities of the supramarginal (r = -0.407), middle temporal gyrus (r = -0.40) and precuneus (r = -0.377; all P &lt; 0.05) in HE; and negatively associated with plasma tau levels in patients (r = -0.626). We propose that plasma tau may serve as a window to both structure and function of the brain. Higher education is a protective factor against AD and is associated with lower plasma tau levels in patients. 
24222384	Abnormal salience network in normal aging and in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Brain Mapp 20131112 2014Jul
The salience network (SN) serves to identify salient stimuli and to switch between the central executive network (CEN) and the default-mode network (DMN), both of which are impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD)/amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). We hypothesized that both the structural and functional organization of the SN and functional interactions between the SN and CEN/DMN are altered in normal aging and in AD/aMCI. Gray matter volume (GMV) and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) were analyzed from healthy younger (HYC) to older controls (HOC) and from HOC to aMCI and AD patients. All the SN components showed significant differences in the GMV, intranetwork FC, and internetwork FC between the HYC and HOC. Most of the SN components showed differences in the GMV between the HOC and AD and between the aMCI and AD. Compared with the HOC, AD patients exhibited significant differences in intra- and internetwork FCs of the SN, whereas aMCI patients demonstrated differences in internetwork FC of the SN. Most of the GMVs and internetwork FCs of the SN and part of the intranetwork FC of the SN were correlated with cognitive differences in older subjects. Our findings suggested that structural and functional impairments of the SN may occur as early as in normal aging and that functional disconnection between the SN and CEN/ DMN may also be associated with both normal aging and disease progression. 
24330306	Amyloid burden correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease presenting with aphasia.
Eur. J. Neurol. 20131216 2014Jul
A subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with early and prominent language deficits. It is unclear whether the burden of underlying Î²-amyloid pathology is associated with language or general cognitive impairment in these subjects. The relationship between cortical Î²-amyloid burden on [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Wechsler Memory Scale - Third Edition (WMS-III), the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) was assessed using regression and correlation analyses in subjects presenting with aphasia who showed Î²-amyloid deposition on PiB PET. The global PiB ratio was inversely correlated with MoCA (PÂ =Â 0.02) and the WMS-III Visual Reproduction (VR) subtest (VR I, PÂ =Â 0.02; VR II, PÂ =Â 0.04). However, the correlations between PiB ratio, BNT (PÂ =Â 0.13), WAB aphasia quotient (PÂ =Â 0.11) and WAB repetition scores (PÂ =Â 0.34) were not significant. This study demonstrates that an increased cortical Î²-amyloid burden is associated with cognitive impairment, but not language deficits, in AD subjects presenting with aphasia. The results suggest that Î²-amyloid deposition could be partly contributing to impaired cognition in such patients whilst language dysfunction may be more influenced by other pathological mechanisms, perhaps downstream pathways of Î²-amyloid deposition. 
24625377	Reliability and validity of Cirrus and Spectralis optical coherence tomography for detecting retinal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.
Eye (Lond) 20140314 2014Jun
To evaluate and compare the ability of two Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices to detect retinal and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with healthy subjects; to test the intra-session reliability of two OCT devices in AD patients and healthy subjects. AD patients (n=75) and age-matched healthy subjects (n=75) underwent three Macular Cube 200 Ã— 200 protocols using the Cirrus and Spectralis OCT devices and three 360Â° circular scans centred on the optic disc using the Cirrus OCT device, the classic glaucoma application, and the new Nsite Axonal Analytics application of the Spectralis OCT instrument. Differences between healthy and AD eyes were compared, and measurements provided by each OCT protocol were compared. Reliability was measured using intraclass correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation. Correlations between OCT measurements and disease duration and severity were also analysed. Retinal thinning was observed in AD eyes in all areas except the fovea using both OCT devices. RNFL atrophy was detected in AD eyes with all three protocols, but the Nsite Axonal application was the most sensitive. Measurements by the two OCT devices were correlated, but differed significantly. Reliability was good using all protocols, but better with the glaucoma application of Spectralis. Mean RNFL thickness provided by the Nsite Axonal application correlated with disease duration. Fourier-domain OCT is a valid and reliable technique for detecting subclinical RNFL and retinal atrophy in AD, especially using the Nsite Axonal application. RNFL thickness decreased with disease duration. 
24949424	The roles of biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.
Biomed Res Int 20140514 2014
Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper aims to examine whether biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidants could be useful biomarkers in AD, which might form the bases of future clinical studies. PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were systematically queried to obtain studies with available data regarding markers of oxidative stress and antioxidants from subjects with AD. Although most studies show elevated serum markers of lipid peroxidation in AD, there is no sufficient evidence to justify the routine use of biomarkers as predictors of severity or outcome in AD. 
24964683	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a preliminary study.
J Med Assoc Thai  2014Apr
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized as a transitional clinical state between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has significant higher rate of progression to AD. To compare the changes of metabolites between AD and MCI in specific locations of the brain by using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). MMSE-Thai 2002 and neuropsychological test were performed in 17 patients with memory problem, classified into AD and MCI (10, 7 patients respectively). All patients and three age-matched cognitively normal volunteers were examined with conventional MRI and MRS of the brain. Volumes of interest were located at both-sided frontal and parietal deep white matter. NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and mI/Cr ratios of the patients were analyzed and statistically evaluated relative to cognitively normal volunteers. Statistical analysis was performed using Cohen's kappa coefficient and Kruskal-Wallis test. There was no statistically significant change in metabolites in all brain regions. For AD relative to cognitively normal volunteers, there were strong tendency toward statistically significant decreased NAA/Cr at the left frontal and left parietal regions (p = 0.043 each) and decreased Cho/Cr at the left frontal region (p = 0.028). The changes of the metabolite ratios of MCI were much closer to AD. Strong tendency toward statistically significant decreased NAA/Cr in the left cerebral hemisphere, predominantly parietal region and strong tendency toward statistically significant decreased Cho/Cr at the left frontal region were indicative of neurodegeneration and replacement by gliosis. MRS may be useful for predict a chance that cognitively normal people may convert to the AD. 
24752989	Impairments in experience-dependent scaling and stability of hippocampal place fields limit spatial learning in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Hippocampus 20140505 2014Aug
Impaired spatial memory characterizes many mouse models for Alzheimer's disease, but we understand little about how this trait arises. Here, we use a transgenic model of amyloidosis to examine the relationship between behavioral performance in tests of spatial navigation and the function of hippocampal place cells. We find that amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice require considerably more training than controls to reach the same level of performance in a water maze task, and recall the trained location less well 24 h later. At a single cell level, place fields from control mice become more stable and spatially restricted with repeated exposure to a new environment, while those in APP mice improve less over time, ultimately producing a spatial code of lower resolution, accuracy, and reliability than controls. The limited refinement of place fields in APP mice likely contributes to their delayed water maze acquisition, and provides evidence for circuit dysfunction underlying cognitive impairment.

24190360	Roles of serum fibrinogen Î± chain-derived peptides in Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20131105 2014Aug
To find a blood biomarker and disease-related peptides in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we comprehensively detected serum peptides. Ion intensity of serum peptides from 62 AD patients and 82 control subjects was measured by mass spectrometry. A total of 157 peptides were detected from 30 AD patients and 30 healthy control (HC) subjects. Sixty out of the 157 peptide profiles discriminated between the AD and HC groups. Sixteen out of the 60 peptides were identified, 10 out of which were fragments of a fibrinogen Î± chain (FIBA). Among the 10 peptides, four and six peptides were derived from fibrinopeptide A (FPA, AÎ±1-16) and the C-terminal region of the Î±C-domain (Î±CDC, AÎ±557-610), respectively. The profile of 10 FIBA-derived peptides combined with age discriminated between the two groups with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.940. Validation of this model using a testing set of 32 AD patients and 19 HC subjects showed an AUROC of 0.717, sensitivity of 65.6%, and specificity of 73.7% by a cutoff value of 0.56420. Another value, 0.04029, showed sensitivity of 96.9%, suggesting that subjects with values less than 0.04029 rarely possess AD. FPA and Î±CDC showed increased ion intensity in the AD group compared with the HC group (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05). The profile of 10 FIBA-derived peptides combined with age would be a candidate biomarker for AD, which facilitates screening of the disease. The significant release of FPA and Î±CDC may be involved in the aberrant coagulation that leads to vascular damage in AD. Copyright Â© 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. 
24646423	A mutation protective against Alzheimer's disease renders amyloid Î² precursor protein incapable of mediating neurotoxicity.
J. Neurochem. 20140410 2014Jul
Expression of a familial Alzheimer's disease (AD)-linked mutant of amyloid Î² precursor protein (APP) or the binding of transforming growth factor Î²2 to wild-type (wt)-APP causes neuronal death by activating an intracellular death signal (a APP-mediated intracellular death signal) in the absence of the involvement of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) toxicity in vitro. These neuronal death models may therefore be regarded as AÎ²-independent neuronal death models related to AD. A recent study has shown that the A673T mutation in the APP isoform APP770 , corresponding to the A598T mutation in the most prevalent neuronal APP isoform APP695 (an AD-protective mutant of APP), is linked to a reduction in the incidence rate of AD. Consistent with this, cells expressing the AD-protective mutant of APP produce less AÎ² than cells expressing wt-APP. In this study, transforming growth factor Î²2 caused death in cultured neuronal cells expressing wt-APP, but not in those expressing the AD-protective mutant of APP. This result suggests that the AD-protective mutation of APP reduces the incidence rate of AD by attenuating the APP-mediated intracellular death signal. In addition, a mutation that causes hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type also attenuated the APP-mediated intracellular death signal. The A598T mutation of amyloid precursor protein APP is linked to a reduction in the incidence rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study shows that TGFÎ²2 causes death in neuronal cells expressing wild-type APP, but not in those expressing the AD-protective mutant of APP, suggesting that the AD-protective mutation of APP reduces the incidence rate of AD by attenuating the APP-mediated intracellular death signal.  
24251793	Use of diffusion tensor imaging for evaluating changes in the microstructural integrity of white matter over 3 years in patients with amnesic-type mild cognitive impairment converting to Alzheimer's disease.
J Neuroimaging 20131119 2014Jul
Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is therefore important to identify biomarkers of conversion to AD. This study examined whether the integrity of white matter can predict this conversion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological features of aMCI subjects (n = 41) were compared with normal controls (n = 20) for 12-36 months. Compared to controls, 22 aMCI subjects had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the cingulate fasciculus (CF) at baseline, and 19 of those converted to AD during follow-up. Only two of the other 19 aMCI patients converted to AD. Compared to baseline, AD converters showed lower FA values in the anterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, inferior fronto-occipital fascicles, corpus callosum genu and CF, and higher apparent diffusion coefficient values in the temporal lobe and hippocampus. Those aMCI subjects with lower than normal FA values in the CF were more likely to convert to AD. The connectivity of the hippocampus and cingulate bundles may be affected in the early stage of AD. Impairment of white matter and fiber bundles was more severe at the AD stage than the aMCI stage. 
24412285	Quantitative sensory testing and pain tolerance in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease compared to healthy control subjects.
Pain 20140108 2014Aug
Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) report pain less frequently than their cognitively intact peers. It has been hypothesized that pain processing is altered in AD. The aim of this study was to investigate agreement and reliability of 3 pain sensitivity tests and to examine pain threshold and tolerance in patients with AD. We examined 29 patients with mild to moderate AD and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects with quantitative sensory testing, ie, assessments of detection threshold (warmth detection threshold [WDT]) and pain threshold (heat pain threshold [HPT], pressure algometry, cold pressor test), and assessments of tolerance (pressure algometry, cold pressor test). All procedures were done twice on day 1, 1hour apart, and repeated on day 2. We found no difference between groups for WDT (patient vs control subjects: mean [95% confidence interval]: 35.5Â°C [33.4Â°C to 37.6Â°C] vs 35.4Â°C [34.3Â°C to 36.5Â°C], P=.8) or HPT (41.2Â°C [40.0Â°C to 42.4Â°C] vs 42.3Â°C [41.1Â°C to 43.5Â°C], P=.24). We observed comparable thresholds for pressure algometry (median [25% to 75% interquartile range]: 120kPa [100 to 142kPa] vs 131kPa [113 to 192kPa], P=.10), but significantly lower tolerance in AD patients (213kPa [188 to 306kPa] vs 289kPa [262 to 360kPa], P=.008). No differences were found for the cold pressor test. The study demonstrated good replicability of the sensory testing data with comparable data variability, for both groups, which supports the use of these methods in studies of patients with mild to moderate AD. Contrary to previous studies, we observed a reduced pain tolerance in patients with mild to moderate AD, which suggests that the reduced report of pain cannot be explained by reduced processing of painful stimuli.  
24935028	'The living death of Alzheimer's' versus 'Take a walk to keep dementia at bay': representations of dementia in print media and carer discourse.
Sociol Health Illn 20140617 2013Jul
Understanding dementia is a pressing social challenge. This article draws on the 'Dementia talking: care conversation and communication' project which aims to understand how talk about, and to people living with dementia is constructed. In this article I draw on the construction of dementia manifest in two data sets - a corpus of 350 recent UK national newspaper articles and qualitative data derived from in-depth interviews with informal carers. These data were analysed using a thematic discursive approach. A 'panic-blame' framework was evident in much of the print media coverage. Dementia was represented in catastrophic terms as a 'tsunami' and 'worse than death', juxtaposed with coverage of individualistic behavioural change and lifestyle recommendations to 'stave off' the condition. Contrary to this media discourse, in carers' talk there was scant use of hyperbolic metaphor or reference to individual responsibility for dementia, and any corresponding blame and accountability. I argue that the presence of individualistic dementia 'preventative' behaviour in media discourse is problematic, especially in comparison to other more 'controllable' and treatable chronic conditions. Engagement with, and critique of, the nascent panic-blame cultural context may be fruitful in enhancing positive social change for people diagnosed with dementia and their carers.  
24573658	Insight on AV-45 binding in white and grey matter from histogram analysis: a study on early Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy subjects.
Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 20140227 2014Jul
AV-45 amyloid biomarker is known to show uptake in white matter in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but also in the healthy population. This binding, thought to be of a non-specific lipophilic nature, has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the differential pattern of AV-45 binding in white matter in healthy and pathological populations. We recruited 24 patients presenting with AD at an early stage and 17 matched, healthy subjects. We used an optimized positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) registration method and an approach based on an intensity histogram using several indices. We compared the results of the intensity histogram analyses with a more canonical approach based on target-to-cerebellum Standard Uptake Value (SUVr) in white and grey matter using MANOVA and discriminant analyses. A cluster analysis on white and grey matter histograms was also performed. White matter histogram analysis revealed significant differences between AD and healthy subjects, which were not revealed by SUVr analysis. However, white matter histograms were not decisive to discriminate groups, and indices based on grey matter only showed better discriminative power than SUVr. The cluster analysis divided our sample into two clusters, showing different uptakes in grey, but also in white matter. These results demonstrate that AV-45 binding in white matter conveys subtle information not detectable using the SUVr approach. Although it is not more efficient than standard SUVr in discriminating AD patients from healthy subjects, this information could reveal white matter modifications. 
24647577	Amyloid PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease: a comparison of three radiotracers.
Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 20140320 2014Jul
The increasing use of amyloid PET in Alzheimer's disease research and clinical trials has motivated efforts to standardize methodology. We compared retention of the (11)C radiotracer Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and that of two (18)F amyloid radiotracers (florbetapir and flutemetamol) using two study populations. We also examined the feasibility of converting between tracer-specific measures, using PiB as the common link between the two (18)F tracers. One group of 40 subjects underwent PiB and flutemetamol imaging sessions and a separate group of 32 subjects underwent PiB and florbetapir imaging sessions. We compared cortical and white matter retention for each (18)F tracer relative to that of PiB, as well as retention in several reference regions and image analysis methods. Correlations between tracer pairs were used to convert tracer-specific threshold values for amyloid positivity between tracers. Cortical retention for each pair of tracers was strongly correlated regardless of reference region (PiB-flutemetamol, Ï?â€‰=â€‰0.84-0.99; PiB-florbetapir, Ï?â€‰=â€‰0.83-0.97) and analysis method (Ï?â€‰=â€‰0.90-0.99). Compared to PiB, flutemetamol had higher white matter retention, while florbetapir had lower cortical retention. Two previously established independent thresholds for amyloid positivity were highly consistent when values were converted between tracer pairs. Despite differing white and grey matter retention characteristics, cortical retention for each (18)F tracer was highly correlated with that of PiB, enabling conversion of thresholds across tracer measurement scales with a high level of internal consistency. Standardization of analysis methods and measurement scales may facilitate the comparison of amyloid PET data obtained using different tracers. 
25028582	Occupational exposure to mineral turpentine and heavy fuels: a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra 20140605 2014May
The association between solvents and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the subject of several studies. Yet, only few studies have examined the various solvents separately, and the controls have rarely been monitored long enough. For these reasons and others, we believe that further studies are required. The objective of this study was to identify solvents associated with the clinicoradiological diagnostic of AD or mixed-type dementia (MD). A retrospective case-control study was performed in 156 patients followed up at the Memory Diagnostic Center of Bertinot Juel Hospital (France). The inclusion criteria were known occupation(s), a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score â‰¥10 at the first visit, a neuropsychological evaluation performed and a diagnosis established in our Memory Diagnostic Center. The diagnostics were crossed with 9 solvents belonging to two classes of solvents. Exposure was evaluated using French national job-exposure matrices. Certain petroleum-based solvents and fuels (i.e. mineral turpentine, diesel fuel, fuel oil and kerosene) were associated with a diagnosis of AD or MD. This association was still significant after adjustment for age, sex and education (adjusted OR: 6.5; 95% CI: 2-20). Occupational exposure to mineral turpentine and heavy fuels may be a risk factor for AD and MD. 
24831964	Uptake of silica nanoparticles: Neurotoxicity and Alzheimer-like pathology in human SK-N-SH and mouse neuro2a neuroblastoma cells.
Toxicol. Lett. 20140514 2014Aug17
Growing concern has been raised over the potential adverse effects of engineered nanoparticles on human health due to their increasing use in commercial and medical applications. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) are one of the most widely used nanoparticles in industry and have been formulated for cellular and non-viral gene delivery in the central nerve system. However, the potential neurotoxicity of SiNPs remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the cellular uptake of SiNPs in human SK-N-SH and mouse neuro2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cells treated with 10.0Î¼g/ml of 15-nm SiNPs for 24h by transmission electron microscopy. We found that SiNPs were mainly localized in the cytoplasm of the treated cells. The treatment of SiNPs at various concentrations impaired the morphology of SK-N-SH and N2a cells, characterized by increased number of round cells, diminishing of dendrite-like processes and decreased cell density. SiNPs significantly decreased the cell viability, induced cellular apoptosis, and elevated the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. Additionally, increased deposit of intracellular Î²-amyloid 1-42 (AÎ²1-42) and enhanced phosphorylation of tau at Ser262 and Ser396, two specific pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), were observed in both cell lines with SiNPs treatment. Concomitantly, the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) was up-regulated, while amyloid-Î²-degrading enzyme neprilysin was down-regulated in SiNP-treated cells. Finally, activity-dependent phosphorylation of glycogen syntheses kinase (GSK)-3Î² at Ser9 (inactive form) was significantly decreased in SiNP-treated SK-N-SH cells. Taken together, these data demonstrated that exposure to SiNPs induced neurotoxicity and pathological signs of AD. The pre-Alzheimer-like pathology induced by SiNPs might result from the dys-regulated expression of APP/neprilysin and activation of GSK-3Î². This is the first study with direct evidence indicating that in addition to neurotoxicity induced by SiNPs, the application of SiNPs might increase the risk of developing AD.  
24397771	Rational design of a structural framework with potential use to develop chemical reagents that target and modulate multiple facets of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 20131227 2014Jan8
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by multiple, intertwined pathological features, including amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) aggregation, metal ion dyshomeostasis, and oxidative stress. We report a novel compound (ML) prototype of a rationally designed molecule obtained by integrating structural elements for AÎ² aggregation control, metal chelation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and antioxidant activity within a single molecule. Chemical, biochemical, ion mobility mass spectrometric, and NMR studies indicate that the compound ML targets metal-free and metal-bound AÎ² (metal-AÎ²) species, suppresses AÎ² aggregation in vitro, and diminishes toxicity induced by AÎ² and metal-treated AÎ² in living cells. Comparison of ML to its structural moieties (i.e., 4-(dimethylamino)phenol (DAP) and (8-aminoquinolin-2-yl)methanol (1)) for reactivity with AÎ² and metal-AÎ² suggests the synergy of incorporating structural components for both metal chelation and AÎ² interaction. Moreover, ML is water-soluble and potentially brain permeable, as well as regulates the formation and presence of free radicals. Overall, we demonstrate that a rational structure-based design strategy can generate a small molecule that can target and modulate multiple factors, providing a new tool to uncover and address AD complexity.  
24571844	[ Low-threshold support services for people with dementia from the family carers' viewpoint].
Pflege  2014Feb
Low-threshold support services are one possibility to relieve family carers with an hourly care for people with dementia. The aim of the study is to invest aspects of low-thresholdness (accessibility, flexibility, reachability, cheapness) with regards to content and to organisation. In an explorative cross-sectional study we collected the estimation according to low-threshold support services of family carers of people with dementia using those services in two regions of North-Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). The analysis was descriptive. The results show, that the 53 family carers estimate the aspects with regards to content mainly with focus on the well-being of the people with dementia as crucial, meanwhile the organisational aspects and the low-thresholdness were less important. Carers' burden was no object. For the family carers and the decision to utilise a low-threshold support service it seems to be import to have a transparent description of the care with a focus on the needs and well-being of the person with dementia.  
24838203	Genetic markers for diagnosis and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Gene 20140515 2014Jul25
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and represents an important and increasing clinical challenge in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Mutations in the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) are responsible for early-onset autosomal dominant AD. The Îµ4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene has been recognized as a major genetic risk factor for the more common, complex, late-onset AD. Fibrillar deposits by phosphorylated tau are also a key pathological feature of AD. The retromer complex also has been reported to late-onset AD. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified putative novel candidate genes associated with late-onset AD. Lastly, several studies showed that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum of AD patients can be used as biomarkers in AD diagnosis. This review addresses the advances and challenges in determining genetic and diagnostic markers for complex AD pathogenesis.  
24574275	New insights into Alzheimer's disease amyloid inhibition: nanosized metallo-supramolecular complexes suppress aÎ²-induced biosynthesis of heme and iron uptake in PC12 cells.
Adv Healthc Mater 20131029 2014Jun
Nanosized metallo-supramolecular compounds, [Ni2 L3 ](4+) and [Fe2 L3 ](4+) , can not only strongly inhibit AÎ² aggregation but also reduce the peroxidase activity of AÎ²-heme. Further studies demonstrate that through blocking the heme-binding site, these two compounds can suppress AÎ²-induced biosynthesis of heme and iron uptake in PC12 cells. This work provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of AÎ² inhibitors on AÎ²-mediated neurotoxicity.  
24524897	The familial Alzheimer's disease APPV717I mutation alters APP processing and Tau expression in iPSC-derived neurons.
Hum. Mol. Genet. 20140212 2014Jul1
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular plaques containing amyloid Î² (AÎ²)-protein and intracellular tangles containing hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Here, we describe the generation of inducible pluripotent stem cell lines from patients harboring the London familial AD (fAD) amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation (V717I). We examine AD-relevant phenotypes following directed differentiation to forebrain neuronal fates vulnerable in AD. We observe that over differentiation time to mature neuronal fates, APP expression and levels of AÎ² increase dramatically. In both immature and mature neuronal fates, the APPV717I mutation affects both Î²- and Î³-secretase cleavage of APP. Although the mutation lies near the Î³-secretase cleavage site in the transmembrane domain of APP, we find that Î²-secretase cleavage of APP is elevated leading to generation of increased levels of both APPsÎ² and AÎ². Furthermore, we find that this mutation alters the initial cleavage site of Î³-secretase, resulting in an increased generation of both AÎ²42 and AÎ²38. In addition to altered APP processing, an increase in levels of total and phosphorylated Tau is observed in neurons with the APPV717I mutation. We show that treatment with AÎ²-specific antibodies early in culture reverses the phenotype of increased total Tau levels, implicating altered AÎ² production in fAD neurons in this phenotype. These studies use human neurons to reveal previously unrecognized effects of the most common fAD APP mutation and provide a model system for testing therapeutic strategies in the cell types most relevant to disease processes.  
24711006	Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: from pathogenesis to a therapeutic target.
J. Clin. Immunol. 20140408 2014Jul
The top-down, reductionist approach of the past three decades has resulted in remarkable progress in identifying genes and proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) peptides and tau protein. Recently, a number of genes of the innate immune pathway have been identified as AD risk factors and several microglial proteins have been shown to be chronically activated in AD brains. Together, these observations suggest a crucial role for neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis and emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is both a cause and a consequence of AD. Epidemiological studies show that long-term users of anti-inflammatory drugs are protected from AD but anti-inflammatory treatment in mild AD patients has not been successful. These observations suggest that anti-inflammatory treatment is likely to be successful if initiated prior to the onset of neurological symptoms. Finally, after the remarkable success of the reductionist approach, a complimentary bottom-up systems approach is necessary to gain a better understanding of the highly complex, multifactorial nature of AD pathogenesis.  
24760109	Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment exerts antioxidant and neuropreservatory effects in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Clin. Immunol. 20140424 2014Jul
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has shown limited promise so far in human clinical studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet overwhelmingly positive preclinical work in animals and human brain cultures support the notion that the therapy remains potentially efficacious. Here, we elaborate on IVIG neuropreservation by demonstrating that IVIG protects human primary neurons against oxidative stress in vitro and that IVIG preserves antioxidant defense mechanisms in vivo. Based on these results, we propose the following translational impact: If the dosage and treatment conditions are adequately optimized, then IVIG treatment could play a significant role in preventing and/or delaying the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. We suggest that IVIG warrants further investigation to fully exploit its potential as an anti-oxidant, neuroprotective and synapto-protecting agent.  
24760112	Clinical trials of intravenous immunoglobulin for Alzheimer's disease.
J. Clin. Immunol. 20140424 2014Jul
The human polyclonal IgG antibody preparation known as Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been under study as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) since 2002. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that IVIG has anti-amyloid and immune modulatory properties relevant to treating neurodegenerative disorders. In early stage AD clinical trials, IVIG was found to reduce cognitive decline and increase brain glucose metabolism. Unfortunately, IVIG failed to meet primary outcome objectives in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial in mild to moderate AD. However, positive cognitive signals were observed in pre-planned subgroup analyses among APOE-Îµ4 carriers and moderately impaired AD patients. Biomarker studies revealed dose dependent increases in plasma and CSF immunoglobulins and decreases in beta amyloid-42 levels. In addition, IVIG treatment was generally safe and well-tolerated. These findings suggest that naturally occurring human anti-amyloid antibodies may play a physiologic role in the clearance of aggregated amyloid proteins. While the results of clinical trials to date do not provide support for the use of IVIG to treat AD at the doses tested, additional studies of IVIG's mechanisms are warranted and may guide the development of more effective therapies for AD in the future.  
24913723	Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Cochrane Database Syst Rev 20140610 2014
According to the latest revised National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) (NINCDS-ADRDA) diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease dementia of the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer Association, the confidence in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease dementia is raised with the application of biomarkers based on measures in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or imaging. These tests, added to core clinical criteria, might increase the sensitivity or specificity of a testing strategy. However, the accuracy of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. A formal systematic evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and other properties of plasma and CSF amyloid beta (AÃŸ) biomarkers was performed. To determine the accuracy of plasma and CSF AÃŸ levels for detecting those patients with MCI who would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia over time. The most recent search for this review was performed on 3 December 2012. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We also requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (managed by the Cochrane Renal Group).No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used so as to maximise sensitivity. We selected those studies that had prospectively well defined cohorts with any accepted definition of cognitive decline, but no dementia, with baseline CSF or plasma AÃŸ levels, or both, documented at or around the time the above diagnoses were made. We also included studies which looked at data from those cohorts retrospectively, and which contained sufficient data to construct two by two tables expressing plasma and CSF AÃŸ biomarker results by disease status. Moreover, studies were only selected if they applied a reference standard for Alzheimer's dementia diagnosis, for example the NINCDS-ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create standard two by two tables. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Where data allowed, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in 14 studies using CSF AÃŸ42. Of the 1349 participants included in the meta-analysis, 436 developed Alzheimer's dementia. Individual study estimates of sensitivity were between 36% and 100% while the specificities were between 29% and 91%. Because of the variation in assay thresholds, we did not estimate summary sensitivity and specificity. However, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary ROC curve. At the median specificity of 64%, the sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 72 to 87). This equated to a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 2.22 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.47) and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.31 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.48).The accuracy of CSF AÃŸ42 for all forms of dementia was evaluated in four studies. Of the 464 participants examined, 188 developed a form of dementia (Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia).The thresholds used were between 209 mg/ml and 512 ng/ml. The sensitivities were between 56% and 75% while the specificities were between 47% and 76%. At the median specificity of 75%, the sensitivity was estimated to be 63% (95% CI 22 to 91) from the meta-analytic model. This equated to a LR+ of 2.51 (95% CI 1.30 to 4.86) and a LR- of 0.50 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.51).The accuracy of CSF AÃŸ42 for non-Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in three studies. Of the 385 participants examined, 61 developed non-Alzheimer's disease dementia. Since there were very few studies and considerable variation between studies, the results were not meta-analysed. The sensitivities were between 8% and 63% while the specificities were between 35% and 67%.Only one study examined the accuracy of plasma AÃŸ42 and the plasma AÃŸ42/AÃŸ40 ratio for Alzheimer's disease dementia. The sensitivity of 86% (95% CI 81 to 90) was the same for both tests while the specificities were 50% (95% CI 44 to 55) and 70% (95% CI 64 to 75) for plasma AÃŸ42 and the plasma AÃŸ42/AÃŸ40 ratio respectively. Of the 565 participants examined, 245 developed Alzheimer's dementia and 87 non-Alzheimer's disease dementia.There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. The accuracy of AÃŸ42 for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia did not differ significantly (P = 0.8) between studies that pre-specified the threshold for determining test positivity (n = 6) and those that only determined the threshold at follow-up (n = 8). One study excluded a sample of MCI non-Alzheimer's disease dementia converters from their analysis. In sensitivity analyses, the exclusion of this study had no impact on our findings. The exclusion of eight studies (950 patients) that were considered at high (n = 3) or unclear (n = 5) risk of bias for the patient selection domain also made no difference to our findings. The proposed diagnostic criteria for prodromal dementia and MCI due to Alzheimer's disease, although still being debated, would be fulfilled where there is both core clinical and cognitive criteria and a single biomarker abnormality. From our review, the measure of abnormally low CSF AÃŸ levels has very little diagnostic benefit with likelihood ratios suggesting only marginal clinical utility. The quality of reports was also poor, and thresholds and length of follow-up were inconsistent. We conclude that when applied to a population of patients with MCI, CSF AÃŸ levels cannot be recommended as an accurate test for Alzheimer's disease. 
25018730	Axonal degeneration in an Alzheimer mouse model is PS1 gene dose dependent and linked to intraneuronal AÎ² accumulation.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140627 2014
Abnormalities and impairments in axonal transport are suggested to strongly contribute to the pathological alterations underlying AD. The exact mechanisms leading to axonopathy are currently unclear, but it was recently suggested that APP expression itself triggers axonal degeneration. We used APP transgenic mice and crossed them on a hemi- or homozygous PS1 knock-in background (APP/PS1KI). Depending on the mutant PS1 dosage, we demonstrate a clear aggravation in both plaque-associated and plaque-distant axonal degeneration, despite of an unchanged APP expression level. Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides were found to accumulate in axonal swellings as well as in axons and apical dendrites proximate to neurons accumulating intraneuronal AÎ² in their cell bodies. This suggests that AÎ² can be transported within neurites thereby contributing to axonal deficits. In addition, diffuse extracellular AÎ² deposits were observed in the close vicinity of axonal spheroids accumulating intracellular AÎ², which might be indicative of a local AÎ² release from sites of axonal damage.  
25022790	Neural stem cells genetically-modified to express neprilysin reduce pathology in Alzheimer transgenic models.
Stem Cell Res Ther 20140416 2014
Short-term neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation improves cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic mice by enhancing endogenous synaptic connectivity. However, this approach has no effect on the underlying beta-amyloid (AÎ²) and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Long term efficacy of cell based approaches may therefore require combinatorial approaches. To begin to examine this question we genetically-modified NSCs to stably express and secrete the AÎ²-degrading enzyme, neprilysin (sNEP). Next, we studied the effects of sNEP expression in vitro by quantifying AÎ²-degrading activity, NSC multipotency markers, and AÎ²-induced toxicity. To determine whether sNEP-expressing NSCs can also modulate AD-pathogenesis in vivo, control-modified and sNEP-NSCs were transplanted unilaterally into the hippocampus of two independent and well characterized transgenic models of AD: 3xTg-AD and Thy1-APP mice. After three months, stem cell engraftment, neprilysin expression, and AD pathology were examined. Our findings reveal that stem cell-mediated delivery of NEP provides marked and significant reductions in AÎ² pathology and increases synaptic density in both 3xTg-AD and Thy1-APP transgenic mice. Remarkably, AÎ² plaque loads are reduced not only in the hippocampus and subiculum adjacent to engrafted NSCs, but also within the amygdala and medial septum, areas that receive afferent projections from the engrafted region. Taken together, our data suggest that genetically-modified NSCs could provide a powerful combinatorial approach to not only enhance synaptic plasticity but to also target and modify underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology. 
24821312	Apolipoprotein e in Alzheimer's disease: an update.
Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 20140421 2014Jul8
The vast majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are late onset (LOAD), which is genetically complex with heritability estimates up to 80%. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been irrefutably recognized as the major genetic risk factor, with semidominant inheritance, for LOAD. Although the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenic nature of APOE in AD are still not completely understood, emerging data suggest that APOE contributes to AD pathogenesis through both amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)-dependent and AÎ²-independent pathways. Given the central role for APOE in the modulation of AD pathogenesis, many therapeutic strategies have emerged, including converting APOE conformation, regulating APOE expression, mimicking APOE peptides, blocking the APOE/AÎ² interaction, modulating APOE lipidation state, and gene therapy. Accumulating evidence also suggests the utility of APOE genotyping in AD diagnosis, risk assessment, prevention, and treatment response.  
24928203	Pre-activated blood platelets and a pro-thrombotic phenotype in APP23 mice modeling Alzheimer's disease.
Cell. Signal. 20140611 2014Sep
Platelet activation and thrombus formation play a critical role in primary hemostasis but also represent a pathophysiological mechanism leading to acute thrombotic vascular occlusions. Besides, platelets modulate cellular processes including inflammation, angiogenesis and neurodegeneration. On the other hand, platelet activation and thrombus formation are altered in different diseases leading to either bleeding complications or pathological thrombus formation. For many years platelets have been considered to play a role in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized by deposits of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and strongly related to vascular diseases with platelets playing a critical role in the progression of AD because exposure of platelets to AÎ² induces platelet activation, platelet AÎ² release, and enhanced platelet adhesion to collagen in vitro and at the injured carotid artery in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms and the relation between vascular pathology and amyloid-Î² plaque formation in the pathogenesis of AD are not fully understood. Compelling evidence is suggestive for altered platelet activity in AD patients. Thus we analyzed platelet activation and thrombus formation in aged AD transgenic mice (APP23) known to develop amyloid-Î² deposits in the brain parenchyma and cerebral vessels. As a result, platelets are in a pre-activated state in blood of APP23 mice and showed strongly enhanced integrin activation, degranulation and spreading kinetics on fibrinogen surfaces upon stimulation. This enhanced platelet signaling translated into almost unlimited thrombus formation on collagen under flow conditions in vitro and accelerated vessel occlusion in vivo suggesting that these mice are at high risk of arterial thrombosis leading to cerebrovascular and unexpectedly to cardiovascular complications that might be also relevant in AD patients.  
24359497	Selective Acetyl- and Butyrylcholinesterase Inhibitors Reduce Amyloid-Î² Ex Vivo Activation of Peripheral Chemo-cytokines From Alzheimer's Disease Subjects: Exploring the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
Increasing evidence suggests that elevated production and/or reduced clearance of amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) drives the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AÎ² soluble oligomers trigger a neurotoxic cascade that leads to neuronal dysfunction, neurodegeneration and, ultimately, clinical dementia. Inflammation, both within brain and systemically, together with a deficiency in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) that underpinned the development of anticholinesterases for AD symptomatic treatment, are invariable hallmarks of the disease. The inter-relation between AÎ², inflammation and cholinergic signaling is complex, with each feeding back onto the others to drive disease progression. To elucidate these interactions plasma samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were evaluated from healthy controls (HC) and AD patients. Plasma levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and AÎ² were significantly elevated in AD vs. HC subjects, and ACh showed a trend towards reduced levels. AÎ² challenge of PBMCs induced a greater release of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) from AD vs. HC subjects, with IL-10 being similarly affected. THP-1 monocytic cells, a cell culture counterpart of PBMCs and brain microglial cells, responded similarly to AÎ² as well as to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) challenge, to allow preliminary analysis of the cellular and molecular pathways underpinning AÎ²-induced changes in cytokine expression. As amyloid-Î² precursor protein expression, and hence AÎ², has been reported regulated by particular cytokines and anticholinesterases, the latter were evaluated on AÎ²- and PHA-induced chemocytokine expression. Co-incubation with selective AChE/BuChE inhibitors, (-)-phenserine (AChE) and (-)-cymserine analogues (BuChE), mitigated the rise in cytokine levels and suggest that augmentation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may prove valuable in AD.  
24931567	An Evaluation of MSDC-0160, A Prototype mTOT Modulating Insulin Sensitizer, in Patients with Mild Alzheimer's Disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with insulin resistance and specific regional declines in cerebral metabolism. The effects of a novel mTOT modulating insulin sensitizer (MSDC-0160) were explored in non-diabetic patients with mild AD to determine whether treatment would impact glucose metabolism measured by FDG-PET in regions that decline in AD. MSDC-0160 (150 mg once daily; N=16) compared to placebo (N=13) for 12 weeks did not result in a significant difference in glucose metabolism in pre-defined regions when referenced to the pons or whole brain. However, glucose metabolism referenced to cerebellum was maintained in MSDC-0160 treated participants while it significantly declined for placebo patients in anterior and posterior cingulate, and parietal, lateral temporal, medial temporal cortices. Voxel-based analyses showed additional differences in FDG-PET related to MSDC-0160 treatment. These exploratory results suggest central effects of MSDC-0160 and provide a basis for further investigation of mTOT modulating insulin sensitizers in AD patients.  
24938500	Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease risk in peripheral tissues; focus on buccal cells.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disorder of the brain and is the most common form of dementia. To-date no simple, inexpensive and minimally invasive procedure is available to confirm with certainty the early diagnosis of AD prior to the manifestations of symptoms characteristic of the disease. Therefore, if population screening of individuals is to be performed, more suitable, easily accessible tissues would need to be used for a diagnostic test that would identify those who exhibit cellular pathology indicative of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD risk so that they can be prioritized for primary prevention. This need for minimally invasive tests could be achieved by targeting surrogate tissues, since it is now well recognized that AD is not only a disorder restricted to pathology and biomarkers within the brain. Human buccal cells for instance are accessible in a minimally invasive manner, and exhibit cytological and nuclear morphologies that may be indicative of accelerated ageing or neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. However, to our knowledge there is no review available in the literature covering the biology of buccal cells and their applications in AD biomarker research. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize some of the main findings of biomarkers reported for AD in peripheral tissues, with a further focus on the rationale for the use of the buccal mucosa (BM) for biomarkers of AD and the evidence to date of changes exhibited in buccal cells with AD.  
24938501	Depression and anxiety levels increase chronic musculoskeletal pain in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
Background/Objectives: During the next decades a rapid increase is expected in the number of patients with dementia suffering from pain who often take less medication compared to normal elderly, due to several diagnostic barriers. Comorbid mood disorders result in great difficulties in pain assessment and further treatment. Design: Twenty five patients with Alzheimer's disease, comorbid mood disorders, and chronic musculoskeletal pain (experimental group) and thirty one patients with Alzheimer's disease and chronic musculoskeletal pain without comorbid mood disorders (control group) were examined. The assessment tools used were Geriatric Pain Measure, Patient Health Questionnaire, Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia, Mini Mental State Examination and Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS v17.0, using the Pearson correlation and the multiple linear regression analysis. Results: The correlation between mood disorders and levels of pain intensity in the experimental group was found to be statistically higher than that in the control group (p&lt;.001). Among all quantitative variables, highly significant correlation (p&lt;.001) was observed between stress and depression symptomatology (r =.550, p&lt;.001) in the experimental group. Normal regression analysis was used to assess possible differences between demographic data and PASS scores. Scores in fearful thinking and physiological responses scales of PASS were higher in female than male (p=.014), whereas scores in the cognitive anxiety scale of PASS have shown a highly significant positive correlation with years of education (p&lt;.001). Discussion: It seems that depression and anxiety are associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain intensity in dementia, thus need to be taken into consideration by health professionals for patient's management.  
24938502	Rivastigmine transdermal patch and physical exercises for Alzheimer's disease: a randomized clinical trial.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
Objective: To determine the effects of rivastigmine patch associated with physical exercise versus rivastigmine patch alone in quality of life (QOL), cognition, activities of daily living (ADL) and functional mobility in Alzheimer's disease (AD)subjects. Methods: A randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted in 40 patients with mild to moderate stages of AD. All patients were daily treated with rivastigmine transdermal patch at a stable dose of 4.6 mg and randomized into two groups: physical exercises or control. The exercise program consisted of aerobic, flexibility, strength and balance movements, twice a week for 6 months. Main outcomes were Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease scale (QOL), Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (ADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and "Time Up and Go Test". Results: Thirty-four patients completed the study. After 6 months, there was a significant improvement in QOL of patients randomized to physical exercise group (P&lt; 0.05). In both groups, there was an improvement on caregivers QOL (P&gt;0.05). When considering cognitive functions, there was no difference between groups. The ability to perform ADL worsened in the group enrolled to RTP alone. There was an improvement in functional mobility in the group treated with RTP. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the association between physical exercises and RTP improves QOL in patients with AD. Cognition remained unchanged in both groups. Regarding the effect of physical exercises in ADL, further trials are necessary to confirm these results.  
24938503	Association of SORL1 Gene Variants with Hippocampal and Cerebral Atrophy and Alzheimer's Disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
Background: Sortilin-related receptor, Sorl1, is a neuronal receptor that interacts with the amyloid precursor protein to regulate amyloidogenesis. Variants in the gene encoding Sorl1 are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its neuroimaging markers. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between SORL1 gene variants with ADrelated brain morphologies and AD, testing for sex-specific effects. Methods: The sample comprised 292 individuals aged â‰¥ 75 years participating in the longitudinal Sydney Older Persons Study. A sub-sample also underwent a brain MRI scan (n=102, 53 males; 49 females). The relationships of three SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs4935774, rs2298813, rs1133174 with brain MRI measures, and AD were determined. Results: Significant associations of SORL1 variants with cross-sectional brain MRI measures and AD were observed only when the sample was stratified by sex. The most common haplotype (H1), comprising rs4935774-T, rs2298813-G, and rs1133174-G alleles (T/G/G) was associated with whole brain atrophy in both males and females (p=0.012 &amp; p=0.013; respectively). Only SNP rs1133174 was individually associated with hippocampal atrophy in males (p= 0.039) and females (p=0.025). Of the 292 participants, 111 had either probable or possible AD. A significant association of H1 with AD (p = 0.017) was observed in females. A nominally significant association of SNP rs1133174 with AD (p = 0.051) was also observed in the whole cohort. Conclusion: The results provide evidence that the association of polymophisms in the sortilin-related receptor gene (SORL1) with AD and its MRI biomarkers of brain and hippocampal atrophy are moderated by sex.  
25034043	Designing in vitro strategies and in vivo models for Alzheimer's disease - promises &amp; challenges.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014
Protein folding is a spontaneous self-assembly process, which occurs in the biological system. Understanding this complex process not only helps in deciphering the mechanism involved in protein misfolding diseases but also helps in modeling in vitro and in vivo systems for testing the therapeutic strategies developed for the disease. Among the protein misfolding diseases, much emphasis has been given to Alzheimer's disease because of its prevalence among elderly individuals and propensity to cause external damage to neurons, an effective cure for which is yet to be designed. Though amyloid fibrils are the major cause of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease, their mechanism of self-assembly during pathological conditions is still under active investigation. This review aims to understand the basic mechanism of amyloid fibril formation and how it can be characterized in different stages by various techniques. With this information, it is possible to design both in vitro and in vivo systems, which not only serves as model systems for understanding the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation but also helps to test new therapeutic strategies against the disease. This review also highlights the pros and cons of currently available in vitro and in vivo systems, which can aid the readers to select a suitable system for their further studies.  
24556750	Verbal fluency patterns in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140219 2014
Background/Aims: Verbal fluency patterns can assist in differential diagnosis during neuropsychological assessment and identify individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). While evidence suggests that subjects with AD perform worse on category fluency than letter fluency tasks, the pattern in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is less well known. Methods: Performance on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) and Animal fluency was compared in control, amnestic MCI, non-amnestic MCI, and AD groups. The sample included 136 participants matched for age, education, and gender. Results: Both MCI groups performed similarly with a category &gt; letter fluency pattern rather than a category &lt; letter fluency pattern typically observed in AD. The pattern in MCI, albeit relatively more impaired than in controls, was more similar to healthy controls who exhibited a category &gt; letter fluency pattern. Conclusion: MCI using a category &lt; letter fluency pattern may not represent AD; however, future research requires longitudinal studies of pattern analysis. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.  
24556805	DNA Methylation of the TNF-Î± Promoter Region in Peripheral Blood Monocytes and the Cortex of Human Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140219 2014
Background: The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) is elevated in the blood of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Epigenetic DNA modifications of the TNF-Î± promoter may account for the observed upregulation. Methods: We analyzed blood samples of 50 AD patients and 55 controls plus 4 AD and 4 control cortex samples using bisulfite sequencing PCR. Results: A significant hypomethylation of the TNF-Î± promoter was found in AD patients' brains but not in their blood. Cortical TNF-Î± promoter DNA was higher methylated than blood-derived DNA, both in AD patients and controls. Conclusion: In AD patients, epigenetic mechanisms of TNF-Î± gene regulation, like aberrant DNA methylation, are not relevant in blood. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.  
24556941	'Residence is not home' is a particular type of delusion associated with cognitive decline of Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140220 2014
Background: Although delusion is one of the common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the association between cognitive deficits and delusions remains unclear. Considering the heterogeneity of delusion, the correlation may depend upon the type of the delusion. Methods: 142 consecutive first-visit AD outpatients of the Tajiri Clinic (Osaki, Miyagi, Japan) were enrolled in the study. Psychological data included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and the Frequency-Weighted Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD-FW). Correlations to cognitive deficits for each category of delusional content were evaluated. Results: More severe delusion of 'residence is not home' was significantly correlated with a lower total MMSE score and poorer orientation as assessed with the CASI. This type of delusion also correlated to activity disturbances and was weakly associated with affective disturbances. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the 'residence is not home' delusion is a particular symptom that has a cognitive background, particularly disorientation, and should be discriminated from other delusional phenomena. We should cope with delusions specifying what types of delusions are present since the content of delusions may critically mark the symptomatology of AD. For this purpose, the BEHAVE-AD-FW may be suitable. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.  
24603451	Apraxia in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: validity and reliability of the van heugten test for apraxia.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20140301 2014
Aim: To assess the reliability and validity of the Van Heugten test for apraxia (VHA), developed for and used in stroke patients, in a memory clinic population. Furthermore, we assess the presence and severity of apraxia in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and investigate which AD patients are likely to develop apraxia. Methods: We included 90 controls (age: 60 Â± 9 years, MMSE: 28 Â± 2), 90 MCI patients (age: 65 Â± 7 years, MMSE: 26 Â± 2) and 158 AD patients (age: 66 Â± 8 years, MMSE: 20 Â± 5). Apraxia was evaluated by the VHA assessing ideational and ideomotor praxis. We retested 20 patients to assess reliability. Results: Intrarater reliability was 0.88 and interrater reliability was 0.73. AD patients performed worse on the VHA (median: 88; range: 51-90) than controls (median: 90; range: 88-90) and MCI patients (median: 89; range: 84-90) (both p &lt; 0.001). Apraxia was prevalent in 35% of AD patients, in 10% of MCI and it was not observed in controls (0%; p &lt; 0.001). In AD, dementia severity was the main risk for apraxia; 15% of mildly versus 52% of moderately demented patients had apraxia (OR = 6.7, 95% CI 2.9-15.6). The second risk factor was APOE genotype. APOE Îµ4 noncarriers (47%) were at increased risk compared to carriers (30%) (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1-4.7). Conclusion: Apraxia can be reliably measured with the VHA and is present in a proportion of patients with MCI and AD. The presence of apraxia in AD is related to dementia severity and APOE Îµ4.

24989628	Rivastigmine Transdermal Patch 13.3Â mg/24Â h: A Review of Its Use in the Management of Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Dementia.
Drugs Aging  2014Aug
Rivastigmine is unique among cholinesterase inhibitors commonly used in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in that it is available as a transdermal patch formulation (Exelon(Â®) patch, Rivastach(Â®) patch, Prometax(Â®) patch). The patch is applied once daily and, in the EU (and US), is available in three sizes: 5, 10 and 15Â cm(2) (releasing 4.6, 9.5 and 13.3Â mg rivastigmine/24Â h, respectively). In the phase III OPTIMA trial, patients with mild to moderate AD who experienced functional and cognitive decline on the 10Â cm(2) patch-the recommended maintenance dose-gained additional benefit when their dose was increased to the 15Â cm(2) patch. For example, 15Â cm(2) patch recipients showed significantly less functional and cognitive decline than 10Â cm(2) patch recipients after 24Â weeks of double-blind treatment. Patients receiving the 15Â cm(2) patch also showed significantly less functional, but not cognitive, decline than those receiving the 10Â cm(2) patch after 48Â weeks of double-blind treatment; as such, OPTIMA only met one of its two co-primary endpoints. The 15Â cm(2) patch was generally well tolerated; although more 15Â cm(2) than 10Â cm(2) patch recipients reported adverse events (e.g. nausea and vomiting), fewer 15Â cm(2) than 10Â cm(2) patch recipients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. By further slowing functional deterioration without markedly compromising tolerability, increasing the transdermal rivastigmine dose to the 15Â cm(2) patch has a favourable benefit-risk profile-and therefore represents a valid option-in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD who have previously experienced functional and cognitive decline while receiving the 10Â cm(2) patch.  
24928144	'Neuroinflammation' differs categorically from inflammation: transcriptomes of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and inflammatory diseases compared.
Neurogenetics 20140615 2014Aug
'Neuroinflammation' has become a widely applied term in the basic and clinical neurosciences but there is no generally accepted neuropathological tissue correlate. Inflammation, which is characterized by the presence of perivascular infiltrates of cells of the adaptive immune system, is indeed seen in the central nervous system (CNS) under certain conditions. Authors who refer to microglial activation as neuroinflammation confuse this issue because autoimmune neuroinflammation serves as a synonym for multiple sclerosis, the prototypical inflammatory disease of the CNS. We have asked the question whether a data-driven, unbiased in silico approach may help to clarify the nomenclatorial confusion. Specifically, we have examined whether unsupervised analysis of microarray data obtained from human cerebral cortex of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and schizophrenia patients would reveal a degree of relatedness between these diseases and recognized inflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis. Our results using two different data analysis methods provide strong evidence against this hypothesis demonstrating that very different sets of genes are involved. Consequently, the designations inflammation and neuroinflammation are not interchangeable. They represent different categories not only at the histophenotypic but also at the transcriptomic level. Therefore, non-autoimmune neuroinflammation remains a term in need of definition.  
23985417	Does study partner type impact the rate of Alzheimer's disease progression?
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Most patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) do not have a spouse. Despite this, the majority of AD research participants enroll with a spouse study partner. It remains unclear if differences between AD patients who do and do not have a spouse may bias study results. In this study, we examined whether AD patients with different study partner types (spouse versus adult child) demonstrate different rates of disease progression over two years on three outcome measures commonly used in AD research, including clinical trials. We used data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to examine disease progression in participants age 55-90 with probable AD dementia. We examined disease progression as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of the Boxes score, the Mini Mental Status Examination, and the Functional Assessment Questionnaire. Analyses were performed on data for all available eligible participants from the NACC UDS and after performing a propensity-matching model to better account for inherent differences between the populations of interest. Propensity matching was successful only when models did not include age and gender. For both propensity-matched analyses and those of all available data, we did not observe any differences between the study partner populations for any outcome measure. These results suggest that if investigators can improve in recruiting AD patients with adult child caregivers to research, the implications to study results may be minimal. 
23985420	Targeting synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease by administering a specific nutrient combination.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Synapse loss and synaptic dysfunction are pathological processes already involved in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synapses consist principally of neuronal membranes, and the neuronal and synaptic losses observed in AD have been linked to the degeneration and altered composition and structure of these membranes. Consequently, synapse loss and membrane-related pathology provide viable targets for intervention in AD. The specific nutrient combination Fortasyn Connect (FC) is designed to ameliorate synapse loss and synaptic dysfunction in AD by addressing distinct nutritional needs believed to be present in these patients. This nutrient combination comprises uridine, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, choline, phospholipids, folic acid, vitamins B12, B6, C, and E, and selenium, and is present in Souvenaid, a medical food intended for use in early AD. It has been hypothesized that FC counteracts synaptic loss and reduces membrane-related pathology in AD by providing nutritional precursors and cofactors that act together to support neuronal membrane formation and function. Preclinical studies formed the basis of this hypothesis which is being validated in a broad clinical study program investigating the potential of this nutrient combination in AD. Memory dysfunction is one key early manifestation in AD and is associated with synapse loss. The clinical studies to date show that the FC-containing medical food improves memory function and preserves functional brain network organization in mild AD compared with controls, supporting the hypothesis that this intervention counteracts synaptic dysfunction. This review provides a comprehensive overview of basic scientific studies that led to the creation of FC and of its effects in various preclinical models. 
24002183	Increased expression of TREM2 in peripheral blood of Alzheimer's disease patients.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
TREM2 has been reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we evaluated TREM2 mRNA and protein expressions in peripheral blood from AD patients and healthy controls. Higher levels of TREM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) and protein (p &lt; 0.001) were identified in AD patients. We observed a significant correlation between TREM2 expressions and MMSE score (mRNA: r = -0.482, protein: r = -0.582; p &lt; 0.01). According to ROC curve analysis, the diagnostic accuracy for TREM2 protein levels on monocytes was 70%, with the sensitivity and specificity 68% and 72%, respectively. Our results indicate that TREM2 might serve as a novel noninvasive biomarker for AD diagnosis. 
24002185	Neuropsychological predictors of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to identify patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the pre-clinical stage. Although subjects with MCI have an increased risk of progressing to dementia, most remain stable or return to normality. The new criteria for diagnosing prodromal AD assume that, to increase the predictive value of the MCI, in addition to a defect of delayed recall there must also be the presence of abnormal biomarkers, investigating structural and molecular neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis of amyloid-Î² or tau proteins. Although acknowledging that the use of CSF degeneration biomarkers is advisable not only for research, but also for clinical purposes, the present review is centered upon the neuropsychological markers of conversion to AD, which are equally clinically important. In particular, results of this review suggest the following: (a) measures of delayed recall are the best neuropsychological predictors of conversion from MCI to AD; (b) memory tests providing controlled encoding and cued recall are not necessarily better predictors than free recall tests; (c) stringent cut-off points are necessary to increase the specificity of these predictors; (d) multi-domain amnestic MCI patients are the best candidates for clinical trials, but not for treatment with disease-modifying drugs; and (e) not only episodic but also semantic memory is significantly impaired in patients who will convert to AD. These data and the underlying neural mechanisms will be discussed, trying to distinguish results obtained in MCI patients from those obtained in a pre-MCI stage of the AD progression. 
24018266	Mild cognitive impairment and anti-Alzheimer disease medications: A cross sectional study of the French National Alzheimer Databank (BNA).
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Unlike Alzheimer's disease (AD), there are no drugs approved for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The objective of this study was to evaluate real world prescriptions of anti-AD medications in patients with MCI in France and to determine characteristics associated with treatment. A cross sectional study of the French National Alzheimer Databank (BNA) was conducted. Patients diagnosed with MCI by physicians of the BNA network in 2010 and 2011 were included in this study. We included 16,236 patients with a diagnosis of MCI in the study. Mean age was 76.4 years old and females were 59.5%. Nine hundred eighty five patients (6.1%) were taking an anti-AD medication. Results of a multivariate analysis show that use was associated with older age, lower MMSE score, amnestic MCI subtype, living at home, and higher education. Treatment with antidepressant drugs was also associated with anti-AD medication use (odd ratio: 1.68; 95% confidence interval: 1.44 to 1.96). "Off label" prescription of anti-AD drugs is low in France and seems to be limited to a population at risk of conversion to AD. Similar analysis will be required to monitor this practice in the future. 
24028866	Serum folate, homocysteine, brain atrophy, and auto-CM system: The Treviso Dementia (TREDEM) study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The role of folate and homocysteine in brain atrophy associated with Alzheimer's disease is not completely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between serum folate and homocysteine levels and the degree of cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy in a first relatively preliminary sample of the Treviso Dementia (TREDEM) study using a potent data mining method. Physiological data, biochemical parameters, clinical assessment data, brain atrophy severity assessed with CT scans, and neuropsycological and disability data were assessed in a group of 232 outpatients (93 men and 139 women, aged 40.2-100 years) enrolled in the TREDEM study carried out in Treviso (Italy). A semantic connectivity map obtained through the Auto-CM system, a fourth generation artificial neural network (ANN), was used to offer some insight regarding the complex biological connections between the studied variables and the degree of brain atrophy. Close associations between low serum folate levels and severe cortical-subcortical atrophy along with severe hippocampal atrophy measured by the width of the temporal horns of lateral ventricles were found. We also showed an association between high homocysteine levels and severe cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy. The role of folate, which is inversely associated with the severity of brain atrophy, was confirmed. Our results also confirm the association between high homocysteine levels and severe cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy. Auto-CM ANN is able to highlight associations sometimes visible only in longitudinal studies through intelligent data mining of a cross-sectional study. 
24028868	Blood plasma IgG Fc glycans are significantly altered in Alzheimer's disease and progressive mild cognitive impairment.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Blood-based anti-amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) immunoglobulins (IgGs) and peripheral inflammation are factors correlating with development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). IgG functionality can drastically change from anti- to pro-inflammatory via alterations in the IgG-Fc N-glycan structure. Herein, we tested if IgG-Fc glycosylation in plasma is indeed altered during the development of AD. Samples from age-matched subjects of 23 controls, 58 patients with stable mild cognitive impairment (SMCI), 34 patients with progressive (P)MCI, and 31 patients with AD were investigated. Label-free shotgun proteomics was applied without glycoprotein enrichment. Glycans on peptides EEQYNSTYR (IgG1) and EEQFNSTFR (IgG2) were quantified, and their abundances were normalized to total IgGn glycoform abundance. Univariate and multivariate statistics were employed to investigate the correlations between the patients groups and the abundances of the IgG glycoforms as well as those of inflammatory mediating proteins. Significant differences (p â‰¤ 0.05) were found, with a lower abundance of complex galactosylated and sialylated forms in AD. For females, a decline in glycoform complexity correlated with disease progress but an inverse change was found in males prior to the onset of AD. Principal component analysis (PCA; Males: R(2)X(cum) = 0.65, Q(2)(cum) = 0.34; Females: R(2)X(cum) = 0.62, Q(2)(cum) = 0.36), confirmed the gender similarities (for controls, SMCI and AD) as well as differences (for PMCI), and showed a close correlation between pro-inflammatory protein markers, AD, female PMCI, and truncated IgG-Fc glycans. The differences observed between genders prior to the onset of AD may indicate a lower ability in females to suppress peripheral inflammation, which may lead to exacerbated disease progression. 
24037032	Protein disulfide isomerase P5-immunopositive inclusions in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the major pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). NFTs are composed of tubular filaments and paired helical filaments containing polymerized hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Another feature of AD is excessive generation of nitric oxide (NO). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a chaperon protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It was recently reported that NO-induced S-nitrosylation of PDI inhibits its enzymatic activity, leading to the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and activates the unfolded protein response. In addition, we previously reported the presence of PDI-immunopositive NFTs in AD. Here, we found that protein disulfide isomerase P5 (P5), which is a member of the PDI protein family, was co-localized with tau in NFTs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P5-immunopositive inclusion in AD. Furthermore, we showed that S-nitrosylated P5 was present and the expression level of P5 was decreased in AD brains compared with that of control brains. We also demonstrated that the knock-down of PDI or P5 by siRNA could affect the viability of SH-SY5Y cells under ER stress. Previously, the observation of S-nitrosylated PDI in AD was reported. NO may inhibit P5 by inducing S-nitrosylation in the same manner as PDI, which inhibits its enzymatic activity allowing protein misfolding to occur in AD. The accumulation of misfolded proteins induces ER stress and may cause apoptosis of neuronal cells through S-nitrosylation and down-regulation of PDI and P5 in AD. 
24037033	A brief history of voxel-based grey matter analysis in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness measurement are common techniques to identify regional atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because studies employing these methods draw conclusions regarding patterns of regional cortical degeneration, it is important to be aware of their possible limitations. To evaluate the effect of different VBM versions, we performed voxel-based analyses through successive versions-from SPM99 to SPM8-as well as FSL-VBM on n = 20 AD patients and n = 20 controls. Reproducibility was assessed in an independent sample, again of n = 20 per group, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Further, we tested the hypothesis that VBM can sensitively detect hippocampal atrophy, but is relatively insensitive to changes in the cortical ribbon, by contrasting VBM with FreeSurfer cortical thickness measurements. The results with both datasets confirmed that VBM preferentially identifies grey matter lesions in the mesial temporal lobe but is largely insensitive to isocortical atrophy. In contrast, FreeSurfer identified thinning of cortical ribbon association cortex more significant in post- rather than pre-Rolandic areas and with relative preservation of primary sensory-motor regions-in other words precisely as would be expected in AD. The results highlight a bias that VBM has toward detecting mesial temporal lobe atrophy. This finding has important implications for interpretation of clinical and cognitive studies in AD. 
24037034	Trends in diet and Alzheimer's disease during the nutrition transition in Japan and developing countries.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) rates in Japan and developing countries have risen rapidly in recent years. Researchers have associated factors such as the Western diet, obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking with risk of AD. This paper evaluates whether the dietary transition might explain the rising trend of AD prevalence in Japan and in developing countries, evaluating other factors when possible. This study used two approaches to see whether dietary or other changes could explain AD trends in Japan and developing countries. One approach involved comparing trends of AD in Japan with changes in national dietary supply factors, alcohol consumption, and lung cancer mortality rates from zero to 25 years before the prevalence data. The second compared AD prevalence values for eight developing countries with dietary supply factors from zero to 25 years before the prevalence data. For Japan, alcohol consumption, animal product, meat and rice supply, and lung cancer rates correlated highly with AD prevalence data, with the strongest correlation for a lag of 15-25 years. In the eight-country study, total energy and animal fat correlated highly with AD prevalence data, with a lag of 15-20 years. Mechanisms to explain the findings include increased obesity for the eight countries, and increases in cholesterol, saturated fat, and iron from increases in animal products and meat supply for Japan. Evidently AD rates will continue rising in non-Western countries for some time unless we address major risk factors involving diet, obesity, and smoking. 
24047616	Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in senescence-accelerated OXYS rats can be partially retarded with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
We previously showed that mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 (plastoquinonyl-decyltriphenylphosphonium) at nanomolar concentrations is capable of preventing and slowing down some cerebral dysfunctions in accelerated-senescence OXYS rats. Here we demonstrate that OXYS rats develop behavior, learning, and memory deficits against a background of neurodegeneration signs detected by magnetic resonance tomography and amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) pathology similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Long-term treatment with SkQ1 (250 nmol/kg body weight daily from the age of 1.5 to 23 months) reduced the age-related alterations in behavior and spatial memory deficit in Morris water maze in OXYS and Wistar rats. Furthermore, this is the first report that SkQ1 treatment slows down pathological accumulation of AÎ²PP, AÎ², and hyperphosphorylation of tau-protein in OXYS rats, as well as age-dependent changes in healthy Wistar rats. Our results support the possibility of using the OXYS strain as a rat model of AD-like pathology. It seems probable that the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 can be a good prophylactic strategy to maintain brain health and to treat AD. 
24047617	IL12/23 p40 inhibition ameliorates Alzheimer's disease-associated neuropathology and spatial memory in SAMP8 mice.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Progressively increased proinflammatory status is a major characteristic of the aging process and associated with age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD). However, the regulation and role of common proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23, in the aged brain are still unclear. Using the senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) model, we screened the cerebral expression of IL-12/23 in 3-, 7-, and 11-month-old mice and observed that their levels in the brain were upregulated during aging. To further examine whether the heightened activation of inflammatory cytokines may contribute to age-related brain dysfunction, we employed direct in vivo infusion of nonviral small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down the common IL-12/23 signaling subunit p40 in the brain. We found that these p40-deficient mice had significantly decreased cerebral amyloid-Î² levels, reduced synaptic and neuronal loss, and reversed cognitive impairments. Furthermore, in vivo delivery of a neutralizing p40-specific antibody likewise ameliorated AD-associated pathology and cognitive deficits in SAMP8 mice. Thus, our data indicate that the upregulated cerebral IL-12/23 during aging is involved in age-associated brain dysfunction and point to the modulation of IL-12/23 signaling molecule p40 as a promising strategy for the development of an AD therapy. 
24056089	Differential prospective memory profiles in frontotemporal dementia syndromes.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to remember to execute an intended action either at a future time (Time-based PM) or when a specific event occurs (Event-based PM). Previous studies demonstrate impaired PM in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the status of PM in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remains unknown. To examine PM performance and its associated cognitive mechanisms, in two subtypes of FTD: semantic dementia (SD) and the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD), in comparison with matched AD and control participants. Twenty-four dementia patients (SD = 8; bvFTD = 8; AD = 8) and 12 age- and education-matched controls underwent a shortened version of the Cambridge Behavioural Prospective Memory Test, as well as a standard neuropsychological test battery. Compared to controls, SD patients exhibited preserved Time-based PM in the context of impaired Event-based PM, with the latter strongly associated with deficits in semantic processing. In contrast, bvFTD and AD patients demonstrated global PM impairments irrespective of subscale, which strongly correlated with deficits in delayed episodic retrieval for both groups. Caregiver reports of stereotypical behaviors were associated with compromised Event-based PM in SD and Time-based PM in bvFTD, with no such relationship evident in AD. This is the first study to investigate prospective memory in FTD syndromes. A relative sparing of Time-based PM was observed in SD, in contrast with global PM deficits in bvFTD. Disrupted PM processing was found to correlate with stereotypical behaviors in FTD syndromes, a finding that we suggest is worthy of further investigation. 
24064468	A new algorithm for predicting time to disease endpoints in Alzheimer's disease patients.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The ability to predict the length of time to death and institutionalization has strong implications for Alzheimer's disease patients and caregivers, health policy, economics, and the design of intervention studies. To develop and validate a prediction algorithm that uses data from a single visit to estimate time to important disease endpoints for individual Alzheimer's disease patients. Two separate study cohorts (Predictors 1, N = 252; Predictors 2, N = 254), all initially with mild Alzheimer's disease, were followed for 10 years at three research centers with semiannual assessments that included cognition, functional capacity, and medical, psychiatric, and neurologic information. The prediction algorithm was based on a longitudinal Grade of Membership model developed using the complete series of semiannually-collected Predictors 1 data. The algorithm was validated on the Predictors 2 data using data only from the initial assessment to predict separate survival curves for three outcomes. For each of the three outcome measures, the predicted survival curves fell well within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed survival curves. Patients were also divided into quintiles for each endpoint to assess the calibration of the algorithm for extreme patient profiles. In all cases, the actual and predicted survival curves were statistically equivalent. Predictive accuracy was maintained even when key baseline variables were excluded, demonstrating the high resilience of the algorithm to missing data. The new prediction algorithm accurately predicts time to death, institutionalization, and need for full-time care in individual Alzheimer's disease patients; it can be readily adapted to predict other important disease endpoints. The algorithm will serve an unmet clinical, research, and public health need. 
24121966	Candidate blood proteome markers of Alzheimer's disease onset and progression: a systematic review and replication study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
A blood-based protein biomarker, or set of protein biomarkers, that could predict onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) would have great utility; potentially clinically, but also for clinical trials and especially in the selection of subjects for preventative trials. We reviewed a comprehensive list of 21 published discovery or panel-based (&gt; 100 proteins) blood proteomics studies of AD, which had identified a total of 163 candidate biomarkers. Few putative blood-based protein biomarkers replicate in independent studies but we found that some proteins do appear in multiple studies; for example, four candidate biomarkers are found to associate with AD-related phenotypes in five independent research cohorts in these 21 studies: Î±-1-antitrypsin, Î±-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein E, and complement C3. Using SomaLogic's SOMAscan proteomics technology, we were able to conduct a large-scale replication study for 94 of the 163 candidate biomarkers from these 21 published studies in plasma samples from 677 subjects from the AddNeuroMed (ANM) and the Alzheimer's Research UK/Maudsley BRC Dementia Case Registry at King's Health Partners (ARUK/DCR) research cohorts. Nine of the 94 previously reported candidates were found to associate with AD-related phenotypes (False Discovery Rate (FDR) q-value &lt; 0.1). These proteins show sufficient replication to be considered for further investigation as a biomarker set. Overall, we show that there are some signs of a replicable signal in the range of proteins identified in previous studies and we are able to further replicate some of these. This suggests that AD pathology does affect the blood proteome with some consistency. 
24290604	Genistein antagonizes inflammatory damage induced by Î²-amyloid peptide in microglia through TLR4 and NF-ÎºB.
Nutrition  2014Jan
Microglia activation and neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB-mediated signal pathways exert key modulating roles in the inflammatory processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether genistein (Gen) has a neuroprotective effect against inflammatory damage induced by Î²-amyloid peptide25-35 (AÎ²25-35) through the TLR4 and NF-ÎºB-mediated signal pathways. BV-2 microglia cells were preincubated with Gen for 2 h and then treated with 25 Î¼M AÎ²25-35 for another 24 h. The expression of inflammatory mediators, TLR4 and NF-ÎºB and the activity of NF-ÎºB were measured. The results showed that Gen could attenuate the cytotoxicity and inflammatory damage induced by AÎ²25-35. Gen also significantly reversed AÎ²25-35-induced up-regulation of TLR4 and NF-ÎºB expression and the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NF-ÎºB. These results indicated that Gen could alleviate the inflammation caused by AÎ²25-35 treatment, which might be associated with the regulation of the TLR4/NF-ÎºB signal pathway. 
24229510	Regular exercise prevents non-cognitive disturbances in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Neuropsychopharmacol. 20131114 2014Apr
Previously, we reported that in a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) generated by exogenous administration of AÎ²â‚?â‚‹â‚„â‚‚ (250 pmol/d for 2 wk) via mini-osmotic pump, the animals exhibited learning and memory impairment, which could be attributed to the deleterious alterations in the levels of cognition-related signalling molecules. We showed that 4 wk of treadmill exercise totally prevented these impairments. Here, we evaluated the effect of exercise on non-cognitive function and basal synaptic transmission in the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) area using the same AD model. Our results indicated that the anxiety behaviour of AÎ²-treated rats was prevented by 4 wk of treadmill exercise. Exercised/AÎ²-infused rats spent a longer time in the centre area of the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) paradigms and the light area of the light-dark (LD) box, which were similar to those of control and exercise rats. Furthermore, under basal conditions the aberrant up-regulation of calcineurin (PP2B) and reduction of phosphorylated CaÂ²â?º/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (p-CaMKII) levels induced by AD-like pathology were normalised by the exercise regimen. We conclude that regular exercise may exert beneficial effects on both cognitive and non-cognitive functions in this AD model. 
24725413	Activity-dependent p25 generation regulates synaptic plasticity and AÎ²-induced cognitive impairment.
Cell  2014Apr10
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulates numerous neuronal functions with its activator, p35. Under neurotoxic conditions, p35 undergoes proteolytic cleavage to liberate p25, which has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that p25 is generated following neuronal activity under physiological conditions in a GluN2B- and CaMKIIÎ±-dependent manner. Moreover, we developed a knockin mouse model in which endogenous p35 is replaced with a calpain-resistant mutant p35 (Î”p35KI) to prevent p25 generation. The Î”p35KI mice exhibit impaired long-term depression and defective memory extinction, likely mediated through persistent GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser845. Finally, crossing the Î”p35KI mice with the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) resulted in an amelioration of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²)-induced synaptic depression and cognitive impairment. Together, these results reveal a physiological role of p25 production in synaptic plasticity and memory and provide new insights into the function of p25 in AÎ²-associated neurotoxicity and AD-like pathology. 
24514750	The growth and impact of Alzheimer disease centers as measured by social network analysis.
JAMA Neurol  2014Apr
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no effective therapies. In 1984, the National Institute on Aging created the first 5 AD centers (ADCs) in an effort to coordinate research efforts into the pathology and treatment of the disease. Since that time, the ADC program has expanded to include 27 centers in major medical schools throughout the United States. A major aim of ADCs is to develop shared resources, such as tissue samples and patient populations, and thereby promote large-scale, high-impact studies that go beyond the capabilities of any single investigator or institution working in isolation. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of the ADC program over the past 25 years. We systematically harvested every article published by ADC investigators and used social network analysis to analyze copublication networks. A total of 12170 ADC papers were published from 1985 through 2012. The frequency of collaborations has increased greatly from the time that the ADCs were started until the present, even after the expansion of ADCs and the recruitment of new investigators plateaued. Moreover, the collaborations established within the context of the ADC program are increasingly interinstitutional, consistent with the overall goal of the program to catalyze multicenter research teams. Most important, we determined that collaborative multi-ADC research articles are consistently of higher impact than AD articles as a whole. The ADC program has successfully fostered high-impact, multiuniversity collaborations; we suggest that its structural and administrative features could be replicated in other fields of patient-oriented research. 
24733654	Neuronal failure in Alzheimer's disease: a view through the oxidative stress looking-glass.
Neurosci Bull 20140415 2014Apr
Considerable debate and controversy surround the cause(s) of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, several theories have gained notoriety, however none is universally accepted. In this review, we provide evidence for the oxidative stress-induced AD cascade that posits aged mitochondria as the critical origin of neurodegeneration in AD. 
24748674	Amyloid and APOE Îµ4 interact to influence short-term decline in preclinical Alzheimer disease.
Neurology 20140418 2014May20
To examine whether Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) and APOE Îµ4 status independently contribute or interact to influence longitudinal cognitive decline in clinically normal older individuals (CN). Data from 490 CNs were aggregated across 3 observational cohort studies (Harvard Aging Brain Study, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing; median age = 75.0 years, 255 female), and the contributions of APOE Îµ4 and AÎ² on longitudinal change over a median of 1.49 years were examined. Cognitive decline was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Logical Memory (immediate and delayed recall scores). High AÎ² participants were more likely to be APOE Îµ4+ than low AÎ² participants. CNs who were both high AÎ² and APOE Îµ4+ showed greater decline in Logical Memory immediate recall (p &lt; 0.087), Logical Memory delayed recall (p &lt; 0.024), and MMSE (p &lt; 0.034) compared to all other groups (low AÎ²/APOE Îµ4-, low AÎ²/APOE Îµ4+, and high AÎ²/APOE Îµ4-). No other pairwise contrast was significant for any cognitive measure. Clinically normal individuals who are APOE Îµ4+ and have high AÎ² showed the highest cognitive decline. These results suggest that AÎ² and APOE Îµ4 are not redundant contributors of decline in aging but rather interact to promote decline during the short follow-up period examined in this study. Longer follow-up periods will be essential to fully elucidate the influence of Alzheimer disease risk factors on cognitive decline in aging. 
24900954	Mitochondrial dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases: relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140512 2014
Mitochondrial dysfunctions are supposed to be responsible for many neurodegenerative diseases dominating in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). A growing body of evidence suggests that defects in mitochondrial metabolism and particularly of electron transport chain may play a role in pathogenesis of AD. Structurally and functionally damaged mitochondria do not produce sufficient ATP and are more prominent in producing proapoptotic factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this can be an early stage of several mitochondrial disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunctions may be caused by both mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA that code mitochondrial components and by environmental causes. In the following review, common aspects of mitochondrial impairment concerned about neurodegenerative diseases are summarized including ROS production, impaired mitochondrial dynamics, and apoptosis. Also, damaged function of electron transport chain complexes and interactions between pathological proteins and mitochondria are described for AD particularly and marginally for PD and HD.  
24900975	Shared mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140512 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have markedly different clinical and pathological features, but these two diseases are the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have showed that there are common mechanisms in AD and PD. Several genetic studies have revealed mutations in genes associated with the risk of AD and PD. Circumstantial evidences have shown that dysregulation of brain iron homeostasis leads to abnormal iron accumulation and results in AD as well as PD. Î± -Synuclein and tau take part in the mechanisms of these diseases by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Some studies indicated that the loss of LC noradrenergic neurons may occur early in the progression of AD and PD. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of the Cys-loop superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels; some evidence showed that nicotinic receptors may be associated with AD and PD. These experimental and clinical studies may provide a scientific foundation for common shared mechanisms in AD and PD.  
24273030	Do changes in specific cognitive functions predict changes in health-related quality of life in people with Alzheimer's disease?
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20131125 2014Jul
Currently available pharmacological treatments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been associated with modest benefits to cognition, but the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is less well established. Our aim was to determine if decline of specific cognitive functions commonly associated with AD predict which patients maintain or experience a deterioration of their HRQoL over 18â€‰months. We completed an 18-month longitudinal study of 47 community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with probable AD of mild or moderate severity (NINCDS-ADRD criteria) and their family carers. The primary outcomes of interest were 18-month change in self-reported and carer-reported ratings on the quality of life-AD (QoL-AD). The main explanatory variables were 18-month change in specific cognitive functions using a broad range of established tests. Because of multiple comparisons, alpha was set at 1%. Twenty six of 47 and 20/47 participants with AD showed evidence of stable or increased QoL-AD over 18â€‰months according to self report and carer report. Logistic regression analyses showed that for every increase in one standardized score of California Verbal Learning Test-II short delay free recall the odds of stable/increased self-rated QoL-AD over 18â€‰months were 0.27 (95%CI: 0.11, 0.67; pâ€‰=â€‰0.005). After adjustment for anxiety and depression, this inverse association no longer met the study criteria for statistical significance (adjusted OR: 0.31, 95%CI: 0.11, 0.86; pâ€‰=â€‰0.025). None of the other standardized changes of cognitive scores were associated with self-rated or carer-rated QoL-AD grouping. Changes in specific cognitive functions are not associated with changes in HRQoL ratings in AD. Findings suggest that interventions that limit their focus to improving cognitive functions of people with mild to moderate AD living in the community might fail to have an impact on participants' HRQoL. 
24318929	The efficacy of plasma biomarkers in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20131207 2014Jul
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is imperative for the prevention of disease progression and the development of effective treatments. Clinically, AD diagnosis has been based on adherence to clinical criteria. It has recently been proposed that diagnostic criteria should also incorporate biomarker findings. However, the most studied candidates or group of candidates for AD biomarkers, including pathological processes and proteins, needs further research. The current study aimed to investigate the capabilities of the following plasma proteins in the diagnosis of AD and amnesia mild cognitive impairment (aMCI): peripheral interleukin (IL) 10, IL-6, amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) 40, AÎ²42, phosphorylated tau 181, and total tau. In addition to 122 normal control (NC) group, 97â€‰AD patients and 54 aMCI patients were recruited for this study. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze the concentration of the following blood plasma biomarkers: IL-10, IL-6, AÎ²40, AÎ²42, phosphorylated tau 181, and total tau. A one-way analysis of variance (one-factor analysis of variance) of AÎ²40 and IL-10 levels revealed a statistically significant difference between the three groups (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.020). Using AÎ²40â€‰â‰¥â€‰42.70â€‰pg/ml as the cut-off point, the sensitivity of the ability of AÎ²40 to discriminate between AD and NC groups was 80.0%, and specificity was 69.6%. The plasma AÎ²40 biomarker was able to distinguish between AD and NC groups. However, the plasma biomarkers in the present research were not able to distinguish between aMCI and NC groups. 
24905373	Practical management of Alzheimer's dementia.
R I Med J (2013) 20140602 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. There currently is no effective treatment that delays the onset or slows the progression of AD. Significant advances in neuroscience, genetics and molecular biology over the past 25 years have changed the way we think about AD. This article reviews the literature on diagnosis and treatment of AD so that primary care physicians can manage this complex disease. 
24794142	Time reproduction during high and low attentional tasks in Alzheimer's Disease "A watched kettle never boils".
Brain Cogn 20140508 2014Jul
A wealth of empirical evidence suggests that directing attention to temporal processing increases perceived duration, whereas drawing attention away from it has the opposite effect. Our work investigates this phenomenon by comparing perceived duration during a high attentional and a low attentional task in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients since these participants tend to show attentional deficits. In the high attentional task, AD patients and older adults were asked to perform the interference condition of the Stroop test for 15s while in the low attentional task, they had to fixate on a cross for the same length of time. In both conditions, participants were not aware they would be questioned about timing until the end of the task when they had to reproduce the duration of the previously-viewed stimulus. AD patients under-reproduced the duration of previously-exposed stimulus in the high attentional relative to the low attentional task, and the same pattern was observed in older adults. Due to their attentional deficits, AD patients might be overwhelmed by the demand of the high attentional task, leaving very few, if any, attentional resources for temporal processing.  
24793376	Chronic exposure to aluminum and melatonin through the diet: neurobehavioral effects in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
Food Chem. Toxicol. 20140502 2014Jul
Aluminum (Al) is a known neurotoxic element involved in the etiology of some serious neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Antioxidants like melatonin might protect neurons against the damage produced in AD. The APPSWE (Tg2576) transgenic mouse is one of the most used animal models developed to mimic AD damage. In the present study, wild type and Tg2576 mice were orally exposed during 14 months to Al, melatonin, and citric acid, as well as to all possible combinations between them. At 17 months of age, mice were evaluated for behavior using the open-field test and the Morris water maze. Transgenic animals exposed to melatonin only and to Al plus citric acid plus melatonin showed a good acquisition. No effects on acquisition in the Morris water maze were observed in wild type mice. With respect to the retention of the task, only melatonin wild type animals, and Al plus citric acid plus melatonin transgenic mice showed retention during the acquisition. Control wild type animals and Al plus citric acid plus melatonin transgenic mice showed good long term retention. Melatonin improved learning and spatial memory in Al-exposed transgenic mice. 
24684788	Hippocampal subfield volumes at 7T in early Alzheimer's disease and normal aging.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140303 2014Sep
We compared hippocampal subfield and entorhinal cortex (ERC) volumes between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and controls without cognitive impairment. Additionally, we investigated the relation between age and hippocampal subfields and ERC in controls. We performed ultra-high field 0.7 mm(3) 7Tesla magnetic resonance imaging in 16 patients with amnestic MCI, 9 with AD, and 29 controls. ERC, subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG)&amp;CA4 were traced on T2-weighted images. Analyses of covariance, adjusted for age, sex, and intracranial volume showed that compared with controls and patients with MCI, patients with AD had significantly smaller ERC, subiculum, CA1, CA3, and DG&amp;CA4 volumes. Trend analyses revealed similar associations between ERC and hippocampal subfields and diagnostic group. Older age was significantly associated with smaller CA1 and DG&amp;CA4 volumes. In conclusion, almost all hippocampal subfields and ERC show volume reductions in patients with AD compared with controls and patients with MCI. Future, larger studies should determine which subfields are affected earliest in the disease process and what mechanisms underlie the volume loss. 
24684789	Reverse engineering of Alzheimer's disease based on biomarker pathways analysis.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140302 2014Sep
Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an increasingly profound problem to society, yet progress toward a genuine understanding of the disease remains worryingly slow. Perhaps, the most outstanding problem with the biology of AD is the question of its mechanistic origins, that is, it remains unclear wherein the molecular failures occur that underlie the disease. We demonstrate how molecular biomarkers could help define the nature of AD in terms of the early biochemical events that correlate with disease progression. We use a novel panel of biomolecules that appears in cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. As changes in the relative abundance of these molecular markers are associated with progression to AD from mild cognitive impairment, we make the assumption that by tracking their origins we can identify the biochemical conditions that predispose their presence and consequently cause the onset of AD. We couple these protein markers with an analysis of a series of genetic factors and together this hypothesis essentially allows us to redefine AD in terms of the molecular pathways that underlie the disease. 
24721821	Medial temporal atrophy in early and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140315 2014Sep
Late-onset and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD, EOAD) affect different neural systems and may be separate nosographic entities. The most striking differences are in the medial temporal lobe, severely affected in LOAD and relatively spared in EOAD. We assessed amygdalar morphology and volume in 18 LOAD and 18 EOAD patients and 36 aged-matched controls and explored their relationship with the hippocampal volume. Three-dimensional amygdalar shape was reconstructed with the radial atrophy mapping technique, hippocampal volume was measured using a manual method. Atrophy was greater in LOAD than EOAD: 25% versus 17% in the amygdala and 20% versus 13% in the hippocampus. In the amygdala, LOAD showed significantly greater tissue loss than EOAD in the right dorsal central, lateral, and basolateral nuclei (20%-30% loss, p &lt; 0.03), all known to be connected to limbic regions. In LOAD but not EOAD, greater hippocampal atrophy was associated with amygdalar atrophy in the left dorsal central and medial nuclei (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.05) also part of the limbic system. These findings support the notion that limbic involvement is a prominent feature of LOAD but not EOAD. 
24746363	Altered arginine metabolism in Alzheimer's disease brains.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140320 2014Sep
L-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid with a number of bioactive metabolites. Accumulating evidence suggests the implication of altered arginine metabolism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study systematically compared the metabolic profile of L-arginine in the superior frontal gyrus, hippocampus, and cerebellum from AD (mean age 80 years) and normal (mean age 80 or 60 years) cases. The activity and protein expression of nitric oxide synthase and arginase were altered with AD and age in a region-specific manner. There were also AD- and age-related changes in the tissue concentrations of L-arginine and its downstream metabolites (L-citrulline, L-ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, glutamate, Î³-aminobutyric acid, and glutamine) in a metabolite- or region-specific manner. These findings demonstrate that arginine metabolism is dramatically altered in diverse regions of AD brains, thus meriting further investigation to understand its role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of the disease. 
24767949	Bexarotene reduces network excitability in models of Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140402 2014Sep
The nuclear retinoid X receptor agonist, bexarotene, has been implicated in recovery of cognitive function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since AD genetic mouse models also show abnormal neural hyperexcitability, which may play a destructive role in memory storage and retrieval, we studied whether bexarotene exerted dynamic network effects on electroencephalography cortical spike discharge rate and spectral frequency in an AD (hAPP J20 model) and non-AD (Kv1.1 null) mouse models of epilepsy. We find that oral treatment with bexarotene over 1 week acutely reduced spike discharges in both models and seizures in the Kv1.1 null mouse model without major alterations in the background frequency of brain rhythms. The effect was reversible and exhibited a similar rapid onset in hippocampal slices. While the exact mechanisms are unknown, bexarotene counteracts both amyloid-Î²-induced and amyloid-Î²-independent increases in cortical network hyperexcitability. 
24780254	Beneficial effects of caffeine in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease-like tau pathology.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140329 2014Sep
Tau pathology found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial in cognitive decline. Epidemiologic evidences support that habitual caffeine intake prevents memory decline during aging and reduces the risk to develop Alzheimer's disease. So far, experimental studies addressed the impact of caffeine in models mimicking the amyloid pathology of AD. However, in vivo effects of caffeine in a model of AD-like tauopathy remain unknown. Here, we evaluated effects of chronic caffeine intake (0.3 g/L through drinking water), given at an early pathologic stage, in the THY-Tau22 transgenic mouse model of progressive AD-like tau pathology. We found that chronic caffeine intake prevents from the development of spatial memory deficits in tau mice. Improved memory was associated with reduced hippocampal tau phosphorylation and proteolytic fragments. Moreover, caffeine treatment mitigated several proinflammatory and oxidative stress markers found upregulated in the hippocampus of THY-Tau22 animals. Together, our data support that moderate caffeine intake is beneficial in a model of AD-like tau pathology, paving the way for future clinical evaluation in AD patients. 
24786631	Brain gene expression patterns differentiate mild cognitive impairment from normal aged and Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140402 2014Sep
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a cognitive state intermediate between normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate if the molecular signature of MCI parallels the clinical picture, we use microarrays to extensively profile gene expression in 4 cortical brain regions (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, superior frontal gyrus, post-central gyrus) using the postmortem tissue from cognitively normal aged controls, MCI, and AD cases. Our data reveal that gene expression patterns in MCI are not an extension of aging, and for the most part, are not intermediate between aged controls and AD. Functional enrichment analysis of significant genes revealed prominent upregulation in MCI brains of genes associated with anabolic and biosynthetic pathways (notably transcription, protein biosynthesis, protein trafficking, and turnover) as well as mitochondrial energy generation. In addition, many synaptic genes showed altered expression in MCI, predominantly upregulation, including genes for central components of the vesicle fusion machinery at the synapse, synaptic vesicle trafficking, neurotransmitter receptors, and synaptic structure and stabilization. These data suggest that there is a rebalancing of synaptic transmission in the MCI brain. To investigate if synaptic gene expression levels in MCI were related to cognitive function, Pearson correlation coefficient between the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and region-specific messenger RNA expression were computed for MCI cases. A number of synaptic genes showed strong significant correlations (r &gt; 0.8, p &lt; 0.01) most notably in the entorhinal cortex, with fewer in the hippocampus, and very few in neocortical regions. The synaptic genes with highly significant correlations were predominantly related to synaptic transmission and plasticity, and myelin composition. Unexpectedly, we found that gene expression changes that facilitate synaptic excitability and plasticity were overwhelmingly associated with poorer MMSE, and conversely that gene expression changes that inhibit plasticity were positively associated with MMSE. These data suggest that there are excessive excitability and apparent plasticity in limbic brain regions in MCI, that is associated with impaired synaptic and cognitive function. Such changes would be predicted to contribute to increased excitability, in turn leading to greater metabolic demand and ultimately progressive degeneration and AD, if not controlled. 
24811241	Distinct pattern of hypometabolism and atrophy in preclinical and predementia Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140413 2014Sep
The goal of the present study was to determine the earliest patterns of hypometabolism and atrophy in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Stages of AD were defined by positron emission tomography imaging evidence of cortical amyloid pathology in addition to cognitive criteria. Subjects for the study were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database and divided into 4 groups: cognitively normal (CN) amyloid negative (AÎ²-) elderly subjects (n = 36), CN amyloid-positive (AÎ²+) (n = 21), early mild cognitive impairment AÎ²+ (n = 65), and late mild cognitive impairment AÎ²+ (n = 23) subjects. Region of interest-based (primary) and voxel-based (secondary) analyses were used to assess gray matter hypometabolism, quantified by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, and decrease in gray matter volume and cortical thickness was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Region of interest- and voxel-based analyses showed significant hypometabolism but not atrophy in CN AÎ²+ subjects compared with CN AÎ²- subjects. The results suggest that hypometabolism exceeds atrophy in preclinical AD, supporting the notion that amyloid load may affect synaptic activity, leading to synaptic loss and subsequent neuronal loss. 
24964731	Epigenetic regulation of adult neural stem cells: implications for Alzheimer's disease.
Mol Neurodegener 20140625 2014
Experimental evidence has demonstrated that several aspects of adult neural stem cells (NSCs), including their quiescence, proliferation, fate specification and differentiation, are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. These control the expression of specific sets of genes, often including those encoding for small non-coding RNAs, indicating a complex interplay between various epigenetic factors and cellular functions.Previous studies had indicated that in addition to the neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), plasticity-related changes are observed in brain areas with ongoing neurogenesis, like the hippocampus and subventricular zone. Given the role of stem cells e.g. in hippocampal functions like cognition, and given their potential for brain repair, we here review the epigenetic mechanisms relevant for NSCs and AD etiology. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the epigenetic regulation of adult NSCs will advance our knowledge on the role of adult neurogenesis in degeneration and possibly regeneration in the AD brain.

24563468	Metal protein attenuating compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia.
Cochrane Database Syst Rev 20140221 2014
Alzheimer's dementia (AD) may be caused by the formation of extracellular senile plaques comprised of beta-amyloid (AÃŸ). In vitro and mouse model studies have demonstrated that metal protein attenuating compounds (MPACs) promote the solubilisation and clearance of AÃŸ. To evaluate the efficacy of metal protein attenuating compounds (MPACs) for the treatment of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's dementia. We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 29 July 2010 using the terms: Clioquinol OR PBT1 OR PBT2 OR "metal protein" OR MPACS OR MPAC. Randomised double-blind trials in which treatment with an MPAC was administered to participants with Alzheimer's dementia in a parallel group comparison with placebo were included. Three review authors (RM, LJ, ELS) independently assessed the quality of trials according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.The primary outcome measure of interest was cognitive function (as measured by psychometric tests). The secondary outcome measures of interest were in the following areas: quality of life, functional performance, effect on carer, biomarkers, safety and adverse effects, and death. Two MPAC trials were identified. One trial compared clioquinol (PBT1) with placebo in 36 patients and 32 had sufficient data for per protocol analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in cognition (as measured on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog)) between the active treatment and placebo groups at 36 weeks. The difference in mean change from baseline ADAS-Cog score in the clioquinol arm compared with the placebo arm at weeks 24 and 36 was a difference of 7.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 13.24) and 6.36 (95% CI -0.50 to 13.23), respectively.There was no significant impact on non-cognitive symptoms or clinical global impression. One participant in the active treatment group developed neurological symptoms (impaired visual acuity and colour vision) which resolved on cessation of treatment and were possibly attributable to the drug.In the second trial a successor compound, PBT2, was compared with placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia; all were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There was no significant difference in the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) composite or memory between placebo and PBT2 in the least squares mean change from baseline at week 12. However, two executive function component tests of the NTB showed significant improvement over placebo in the PBT2 250 mg group from baseline to week 12: category fluency test (2.8 words, 95% CI 0.1 to 5.4; P = 0.041) and trail making part B (-48.0 s, 95% CI -83.0 to -13.0; P = 0.009). In the executive factor Z score, the difference in least squares mean change from baseline at week 12 for PBT2 250 mg compared with placebo was 0Â·27 (0Â·01 to 0Â·53; p=0Â·042).There was no significant effect on cognition on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or ADAS-Cog scales. PBT2 had a favourable safety profile. There is an absence of evidence as to whether clioquinol (PBT1) has any positive clinical benefit for patients with AD, or whether the drug is safe. We have some concerns about the quality of the study methodology; there was an imbalance in treatment and control groups after randomisation (participants in the active treatment group had a higher mean pre-morbid IQ) and the secondary analyses of results stratified by baseline dementia severity. The planned phase III trial of PBT1 has been abandoned and this compound has been withdrawn from development. The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia. Larger trials are now required to demonstrate cognitive efficacy. 
24750033	Endogenous polyamines reduce the toxicity of soluble aÎ² peptide aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease.
Biomacromolecules 20140502 2014Jun9
Polyamines promote the formation of the AÎ² peptide amyloid fibers that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that polyamines interact with nonaggregated AÎ² peptides, thereby reducing the peptide's hydrophobic surface. We characterized the associated conformational change through NMR titrations and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that even low concentrations of spermine, sperimidine, and putrescine fully protected SH-SY5Y (a neuronal cell model) against the most toxic conformational species of AÎ², even at an AÎ² oligomer concentration that would otherwise kill half of the cells or even more. These observations lead us to conclude that polyamines interfere with the more toxic prefibrillar conformations and might protect cells by promoting the structural transition of AÎ² toward its less toxic fibrillar state that we reported previously. Since polyamines are present in brain fluid at the concentrations where we observed all these effects, their activity needs to be taken into account in understanding the molecular processes related to the development of Alzheimer's disease.  
24986600	New multi-target-directed small molecules against Alzheimer's disease: a combination of resveratrol and clioquinol.
Org. Biomol. Chem.  2014Jul16
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently one of the most difficult and challenging diseases to treat. Based on the 'multi-target-directed ligands' (MTDLs) strategy, we designed and synthesised a series of new compounds against AD by combining the pharmacophores of resveratrol and clioquinol. The results of biological activity tests showed that the hybrids exhibited excellent MTDL properties: a significant ability to inhibit self-induced Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) aggregation and copper(ii)-induced AÎ² aggregation, potential antioxidant behaviour (ORAC-FL value of 0.9-3.2 Trolox equivalents) and biometal chelation. Among these compounds, (E)-5-(4-hydroxystyryl)quinoline-8-ol () showed the most potent ability to inhibit self-induced AÎ² aggregation (IC50 = 8.50 Î¼M) and copper(ii)-induced AÎ² aggregation and to disassemble the well-structured AÎ² fibrils generated by self- and copper(ii)-induced AÎ² aggregation. Note that could also control Cu(i/ii)-triggered hydroxyl radical (OHË™) production by halting copper redox cycling via metal complexation, as confirmed by a Cu-ascorbate redox system assay. Importantly, did not show acute toxicity in mice at doses of up to 2000 mg kg(-1) and was able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), according to a parallel artificial membrane permeation assay. These results indicate that compound is a promising multifunctional compound for the development of novel drugs for AD.  
24343873	Novel tacrine analogs as potential cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease.
Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim) 20131216 2014Feb
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The increase in ACh levels ameliorates the symptoms of the disease. Tacrine is the first clinically approved drug as AChEI used in the treatment of AD. In this paper, we synthesized new tacrine analogs to act on catalytic and peripheral sites of AChE. Their inhibitory activity was evaluated. All novel compounds except 7a showed promising results toward AChE. Two compounds, 10b and 11b, are more potent than tacrine. Furthermore, molecular-modeling studies were performed for these two compounds to rationalize the obtained pharmacological activity. Moreover, various drug-likeness properties of the new compounds were predicted.  
24642424	Gold nanoparticle-based immuno-PCR for detection of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid.
J. Immunol. Methods 20140315 2014Apr
Tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an important biomarker of Alzheimer's disease and some other brain diseases. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been mostly used for quantification of tau and other biomarkers in CSF. However, these assays do not have sufficient sensitivity and dynamic range. In this study we tested the suitability of gold nanoparticles functionalized with tau-specific monoclonal antibody and oligonucleotide template for immuno-polymerase chain reaction (Nano-iPCR) quantification of tau protein in human CSF samples and compared it with ELISA, either commercial or newly developed with tyramide signal amplification. Our data indicate that Nano-iPCR is superior in sensitivity and detection range to ELISA in tau protein detection.  
24799715	Noninvasive in vivo monitoring of tissue-specific global gene expression in humans.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 20140505 2014May20
Circulating cell-free RNA in the blood provides a potential window into the health, phenotype, and developmental programs of a variety of human organs. We used high-throughput methods of RNA analysis such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing to characterize the global landscape circulating RNA in a cohort of human subjects. By focusing on genes whose expression is highly specific to certain tissues, we were able to identify the relative contributions of these tissues to circulating RNA and to monitor changes in tissue development and health. As one application of this approach, we performed a longitudinal study on pregnant women and analyzed their combined cell-free RNA transcriptomes across all three trimesters of pregnancy and after delivery. In addition to the analysis of mRNA, we observed and characterized noncoding species such as long noncoding RNA and circular RNA transcripts whose presence had not been previously observed in human plasma. We demonstrate that it is possible to track specific longitudinal phenotypic changes in both the mother and the fetus and that it is possible to directly measure transcripts from a variety of fetal tissues in the maternal blood sample. We also studied the role of neuron-specific transcripts in the blood of healthy adults and those suffering from the neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease and showed that disease specific neural transcripts are present at increased levels in the blood of affected individuals. Characterization of the cell-free transcriptome in its entirety may thus provide broad insights into human health and development without the need for invasive tissue sampling.

The care provided to the residents of the Alzheimer's unit of the Pont-de-Veyle nursing home follows four main ethical principles: dignity, autonomy, beneficence and non-maleficence. The team demonstrates flexibility with regard to the washing and dressing of the residents, meal times and the organisation of activities. It does not resort to restraint. The respect of the person's dignity and privacy is maintained not only during nursing care but in all other aspects of their life. 
24731236	The application of network label propagation to rank biomarkers in genome-wide Alzheimer's data.
BMC Genomics 20140414 2014
Ranking and identifying biomarkers that are associated with disease from genome-wide measurements holds significant promise for understanding the genetic basis of common diseases. The large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genome-wide studies (GWAS), however, makes this task computationally challenging when the ranking is to be done in a multivariate fashion. This paper evaluates the performance of a multivariate graph-based method called label propagation (LP) that efficiently ranks SNPs in genome-wide data. The performance of LP was evaluated on a synthetic dataset and two late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) genome-wide datasets, and the performance was compared to that of three control methods. The control methods included chi squared, which is a commonly used univariate method, as well as a Relief method called SWRF and a sparse logistic regression (SLR) method, which are both multivariate ranking methods. Performance was measured by evaluating the top-ranked SNPs in terms of classification performance, reproducibility between the two datasets, and prior evidence of being associated with LOAD.On the synthetic data LP performed comparably to the control methods. On GWAS data, LP performed significantly better than chi squared and SWRF in classification performance in the range from 10 to 1000 top-ranked SNPs for both datasets, and not significantly different from SLR. LP also had greater ranking reproducibility than chi squared, SWRF, and SLR. Among the 25 top-ranked SNPs that were identified by LP, there were 14 SNPs in one dataset that had evidence in the literature of being associated with LOAD, and 10 SNPs in the other, which was higher than for the other methods. LP performed considerably better in ranking SNPs in two high-dimensional genome-wide datasets when compared to three control methods. It had better performance in the evaluation measures we used, and is computationally efficient to be applied practically to data from genome-wide studies. These results provide support for including LP in the methods that are used to rank SNPs in genome-wide datasets. 
24886973	Phosphorylation of serine 349 of p62 in Alzheimer's disease brain.
Acta Neuropathol Commun 20140503 2014
Extensive research on p62 has established its role in oxidative stress, protein degradation and in several diseases such as Paget's disease of the bone, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Importantly, previous studies showed that p62 binds directly to Keap1, which is a ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for degrading Nrf2. Indeed, colocalisation of p62 and Keap1 occurs in tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration. A serine (S) residue in the Keap1-interacting region of p62 is phosphorylated in hepatocellular carcinoma, and this phosphorylation contributes to tumour growth through the higher affinity of p62 to Keap1. However, it remains largely unknown whether p62 is phosphorylated in the Keap1-interacting region under neurodegenerative conditions. To answer this question, we generated an antibody against phosphorylated S349 (P-S349) of p62 and showed that S349 is phosphorylated following disruption of protein degradation. In particular, the ratio of P-S349 to total p62 levels was significantly increased in the brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with controls. We also compared the reactivity of the P-S349 antibody with P-S403 of p62 and showed that these two phosphorylated sites on p62 cause different responses with proteasome inhibition and show distinct localisation patterns in AD brains. In addition to disruption of protein degradation systems, activation of oxidative stress can induce P-S349. These results support the hypothesis that disruption of protein degradation systems and sustained activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 system occur in the brains with AD. 
24577476	Fractional anisotropy changes in Alzheimer's disease depend on the underlying fiber tract architecture: a multiparametric DTI study using joint independent component analysis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the simultaneous measurement of several diffusion indices that provide complementary information on the substrate of white matter alterations in neurodegenerative diseases. These indices include fractional anisotropy (FA) as measure of fiber tract integrity, and the mode of anisotropy (Mode) reflecting differences in the shape of the diffusion tensor. We used a multivariate approach based on joint independent component analysis of FA and Mode in a large sample of 138 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, 37 subjects with cerebrospinal fluid biomarker positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI-AD), and 153 healthy elderly controls from the European DTI Study on Dementia to comprehensively study alterations of microstructural white matter integrity in AD dementia and predementia AD. We found a parallel decrease of FA and Mode in intracortically projecting fiber tracts, and a parallel increase of FA and Mode in the corticospinal tract in AD patients compared to controls. Subjects with MCI-AD showed a similar, but spatially more restricted pattern of diffusion changes. Our findings suggest an early axonal degeneration in intracortical projecting fiber tracts in dementia and predementia stages of AD. An increase of Mode, parallel to an increase of FA, in the corticospinal tract suggests a more linear shape of diffusion due to loss of crossing fibers along relatively preserved cortico-petal and cortico-fugal fiber tracts in AD. Supporting this interpretation, we found three populations of fiber tracts, namely cortico-petal and cortico-fugal, commissural, and intrahemispherically projecting fiber tracts, in the peak area of parallel FA and Mode increase.  
24577479	Selenomethionine ameliorates cognitive decline, reduces tau hyperphosphorylation, and reverses synaptic deficit in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Disruption of the intracellular balance between free radicals and the antioxidant system is a prominent and early feature in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Selenium, a vital trace element with known antioxidant potential, has been reported to provide neuroprotection through resisting oxidative damage but its therapeutic effect on AD remains to be investigated. The objective of our study was to investigate the potential of selenomethionine (Se-Met), an organic form of selenium, in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction and neuropathology of triple transgenic AD (3 Ã— Tg-AD) mice. 3 Ã— Tg-AD mice, which were four months old, were treated with Se-Met for 3 months and demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive deficit along with an increased selenium level compared with the untreated control mice. Se-Met treatment significantly reduced the level of total tau and phosphorylated tau, mitigated the decrease of synaptic proteins including synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 in the hippocampus and cortex of the 3 Ã— Tg-AD mice. Meanwhile, glial activation in AD mice was inhibited and the level of reduced glutathione was increased in the treated mice compared with control mice. Additionally, the expression and activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² and protein phosphatase 2A, two important enzymes involved in tau phosphorylation, were markedly decreased and increased respectively by Se-Met treatment. Thus Se-Met improves cognitive deficit in a murine model of AD, which is associated with reduction in tau expression and hyperphosphorylation, amelioration of inflammation, and restoration of synaptic proteins and antioxidants. This study provides a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of AD.  
24577482	The impact of surgery and anesthesia on post-operative cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease development: biomarkers and preventive strategies.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major social and clinical burden in the elderly, affecting 5% of people aged over 65 and 20% aged over 80. Despite improved management, a cure has not been found and hence analysis of predisposing factors to identify preventive strategies has become increasingly important. Surgery and anesthesia have been proposed to increase the incidence of post-operative cognitive decline (POCD) and AD. This is hypothesized to be the result of a malignant neuroinflammatory response and subsequent synaptic impairment in the elderly and susceptible individuals. As a result, strategies are being explored to prevent surgery and anesthesia induced cognitive impairment. Whereas previously the diagnosis of AD was primarily dependent on clinical examination, biomarkers such as inflammatory cytokines, amyloid-Î², and tau deposition in the cerebrospinal fluid have received increased attention. Nonetheless, AD is currently still treated symptomatically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists to improve cholinergic transmission and prevent glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Therapeutic success is, however, often not achieved, since these treatment methods do not address the ongoing neuroinflammatory processes and hence novel therapeutic and protective strategies are urgently needed. This review provides an insight into the current understanding of age-related cognitive impairment post-surgery and reflects on novel markers of AD pathogeneses exploring their use as targets for treatment. It gives a summary of recent efforts in preventing and treating POCD or AD with regards to the choice and depth of anesthesia, surgical strategy, and peri-operative medication, and discusses the mechanism of action and therapeutic prospects of novel agents.  
24595197	Decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of L-carnitine in non-apolipoprotein E4 carriers at early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Increasing evidence suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder that includes several subtypes with different etiology and progression. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is being used to find new biomarkers reflecting the complexity of the pathological pathways within this disease. We used CSF and clinical data from patients to investigate the status of asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine, creatine, suberylglycine, and L-carnitine along AD progression. These molecules play important roles in mitochondrial function and dysfunction in mitochondrial metabolism are involved in AD pathology. We found that non-APOE4 carriers show lower levels of L-carnitine in CSF early in AD. L-carnitine levels correlate with amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) levels and Mini-Mental State Examination score, but do not add to the specificity or sensitivity of the classical AD CSF biomarkers, AÎ²42, phospho-tau, and total-tau. Our results suggest APOE genotype-dependent differences in L-carnitine synthesis or metabolism along AD, and insinuate that L-carnitine treatments would be more beneficial for AD patients not carrying the APOE4 isoform.  
24595198	Brain pyroglutamate amyloid-Î² is produced by cathepsin B and is reduced by the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d, representing a potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutic.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Pyroglutamate amyloid-Î² peptides (pGlu-AÎ²) are particularly pernicious forms of amyloid-Î² peptides (AÎ²) present in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. pGlu-AÎ² peptides are N-terminally truncated forms of full-length AÎ² peptides (flAÎ²(1-40/42)) in which the N-terminal glutamate is cyclized to pyroglutamate to generate pGlu-AÎ²(3-40/42). Î²-secretase cleavage of amyloid-Î² precursor protein (AÎ²PP) produces flAÎ²(1-40/42), but it is not yet known whether the Î²-secretase BACE1 or the alternative Î²-secretase cathepsin B (CatB) participate in the production of pGlu-AÎ². Therefore, this study examined the effects of gene knockout of these proteases on brain pGlu-AÎ² levels in transgenic AÎ²PPLon mice, which express AÎ²PP isoform 695 and have the wild-type (wt) Î²-secretase activity found in most AD patients. Knockout or overexpression of the CatB gene reduced or increased, respectively, pGlu-AÎ²(3-40/42), flAÎ²(1-40/42), and pGlu-AÎ² plaque load, but knockout of the BACE1 gene had no effect on those parameters in the transgenic mice. Treatment of AÎ²PPLon mice with E64d, a cysteine protease inhibitor of CatB, also reduced brain pGlu-AÎ²(3-42), flAÎ²(1-40/42), and pGlu-AÎ² plaque load. Treatment of neuronal-like chromaffin cells with CA074Me, an inhibitor of CatB, resulted in reduced levels of pGlu-AÎ²(3-40) released from the activity-dependent, regulated secretory pathway. Moreover, CatB knockout and E64d treatment has been previously shown to improve memory deficits in the AÎ²PPLon mice. These data illustrate the role of CatB in producing pGlu-AÎ² and flAÎ² that participate as key factors in the development of AD. The advantages of CatB inhibitors, especially E64d and its derivatives, as alternatives to BACE1 inhibitors in treating AD patients are discussed. 
24603942	T1-weighted axial visual rating scale for an assessment of medial temporal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The most-widely used visual rating scale (VRS) for medial temporal atrophy is the T1-weighted (T1W) coronal VRS developed by Scheltens et al. However, it is often difficult to use the T1W-coronal VRS in cases with limitations in obtaining T1W-coronal images. To overcome this issue, we modified the T1W-coronal VRS onto the axial plane. The purposes of this study were to validate our T1W-axial VRS by examining its compatibility with the original T1W-coronal VRS and by investigating the correlation with the cognitive functions and hippocampal volumes. Participants were 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia and 30 elderly with normal cognition. We transposed each component of the T1W-coronal VRS onto T1W-axial images (i.e., the largest height of the hippocampal formation into the width of the medial temporal lobe). The compatibility of T1W-axial VRS with T1W-coronal one was determined using the kappa value. The correlations of T1W-axial VRS with cognitive performance or the hippocampal volumes were analyzed with age, gender, and education as covariates. The kappa value between the T1W-axial and T1W-coronal VRS was 0.772 (p &lt; 0.045). The T1W-axial VRS showed a significant correlation with the scores of cognitive functions, including verbal memory tests (-0.601, p &lt; 0.001 for the left). Furthermore, the T1W-axial VRS also correlated well with hippocampal volumes (-0.576, p &lt; 0.001). The T1W-axial VRS showed good agreement with T1W-coronal VRS and correlated well with cognitive functions as well as hippocampal volumes, which suggests that the T1-axial VRS may replace the original T1W-coronal one. 
24614897	Methylglyoxal produced by amyloid-Î² peptide-induced nitrotyrosination of triosephosphate isomerase triggers neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) aggregates induce nitro-oxidative stress, contributing to the characteristic neurodegeneration found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the most strongly nitrotyrosinated proteins in AD is the triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) enzyme which regulates glycolytic flow, and its efficiency decreased when it is nitrotyrosinated. The main aims of this study were to analyze the impact of TPI nitrotyrosination on cell viability and to identify the mechanism behind this effect. In human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), we evaluated the effects of AÎ²42 oligomers on TPI nitrotyrosination. We found an increased production of methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic byproduct of the inefficient nitro-TPI function. The proapoptotic effects of AÎ²42 oligomers, such as decreasing the protective Bcl2 and increasing the proapoptotic caspase-3 and Bax, were prevented with a MG chelator. Moreover, we used a double mutant TPI (Y165F and Y209F) to mimic nitrosative modifications due to AÎ² action. Neuroblastoma cells transfected with the double mutant TPI consistently triggered MG production and a decrease in cell viability due to apoptotic mechanisms. Our data show for the first time that MG is playing a key role in the neuronal death induced by AÎ² oligomers. This occurs because of TPI nitrotyrosination, which affects both tyrosines associated with the catalytic center.  
24614898	Fungal infection in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dementia mainly among the elderly. This disease is characterized by the presence in the brain of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that provoke neuronal cell death, vascular dysfunction, and inflammatory processes. In the present work, we have analyzed the existence of fungal infection in Alzheimer's disease patients. A proteomic analysis provides compelling evidence for the existence of fungal proteins in brain samples from Alzheimer's disease patients. Furthermore, PCR analysis reveals a variety of fungal species in these samples, dependent on the patient and the tissue tested. DNA sequencing demonstrated that several fungal species can be found in brain samples. Together, these results show that fungal macromolecules can be detected in brain from Alzheimer's disease patients. To our knowledge these findings represent the first evidence that fungal infection is detectable in brain samples from Alzheimer's disease patients. The possibility that this may represent a risk factor or may contribute to the etiological cause of Alzheimer's disease is discussed.  
24614900	Plasma membrane injury depends on bilayer lipid composition in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Increasing evidence indicates that interaction of amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) with the cell membrane is a primary step in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurotoxicity. In particular, it has been demonstrated that lipid rafts are key sites of AÎ² production, aggregation, and interaction with the cell membrane. In this study we show that AÎ²42 oligomers are recruited to lipid rafts, leading to plasma membrane perturbation and Ca2+ dyshomeostasis in primary fibroblasts from familial AD patients bearing APPVal717Ile, PS-1Leu392Val, or PS-1Met146Leu gene mutations. In contrast, a moderate increase in membrane cholesterol content precluded the interaction of AÎ²42 oligomers with the plasma membrane and resulting cell damage. Moreover, the recruitment of amyloid assemblies to lipid raft domains of cholesterol-depleted fibroblasts was significantly increased, thus triggering an earlier and sharper increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and plasma membrane permeabilization. Our findings suggest a protective role for raft cholesterol against amyloid toxicity in AD.  
24614903	Differences in nutritional status between very mild Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Studies on the systemic availability of nutrients and nutritional status in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are widely available, but the majority included patients in a moderate stage of AD. This study compares the nutritional status between mild AD outpatients and healthy controls. A subgroup of Dutch drug-naÃ¯ve patients with mild AD (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) â‰¥20) from the Souvenir II randomized controlled study (NTR1975) and a group of Dutch healthy controls were included. Nutritional status was assessed by measuring levels of several nutrients, conducting the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNAÂ®) questionnaire and through anthropometric measures. In total, data of 93 healthy cognitively intact controls (MMSE 29.0 [23.0-30.0]) and 79 very mild AD patients (MMSE = 25.0 [20.0-30.0]) were included. Plasma selenium (p &lt; 0.001) and uridine (p = 0.046) levels were significantly lower in AD patients, with a similar trend for plasma vitamin D (p = 0.094) levels. In addition, the fatty acid profile in erythrocyte membranes was different between groups for several fatty acids. Mean MNA screening score was significantly lower in AD patients (p = 0.008), but not indicative of malnutrition risk. No significant differences were observed for other micronutrient or anthropometric parameters. In non-malnourished patients with very mild AD, lower levels of some micronutrients, a different fatty acid profile in erythrocyte membranes and a slightly but significantly lower MNA screening score were observed. This suggests that subtle differences in nutrient status are present already in a very early stage of AD and in the absence of protein/energy malnutrition. 
24625800	Strikingly reduced amyloid burden and improved behavioral performance in Alzheimer's disease mice immunized with recombinant chimeric vaccines by hexavalent foldable AÎ²â‚?â‚‹â‚?â‚… fused to toxin-derived carrier proteins.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Targeting on the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, AÎ²(1-15) sequence alone induces low antibody response and poor protection against AD. We describe here the immunological characterization and protective efficacy of several recombinant chimeric vaccines with hexavalent foldable AÎ²(1-15) (6AÎ²15) fused to PADRE or toxin-derived carrier proteins. Immunization with these chimeric antigens generated robust Th2 immune responses with high anti-AÎ²42 antibody titers in different mice, which recognized neurotoxic AÎ²42 oligomers, but did not stimulate AÎ²42-specific T cell responses. These 6AÎ²15 chimeric vaccines markedly reduced AÎ² pathology and prevented development of behavioral deficits in immunized older AD mice. Importantly, toxin-derived carrier proteins as molecular adjuvants of chimeric vaccines could substantially boost immune responses and overcome AÎ²- and old age-associated hypo-responsiveness, and elicit long-term AÎ²-specific antibody response, which in turn inhibited AÎ²-mediated pathology and improved acquisition and retention of spatial memory in immunized AD mice. These data indicate that toxin fragments as molecular adjuvants are promising new tools for the rational design and development of prototype chimeric vaccines for AD and this type of chimeric vaccine design has the added advantage of overcoming hypo-responsiveness in elderly AD patients with pre-existing memory Th cells from tetanus toxin. 
24896243	Modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer disease and subjective memory impairment across age groups.
PLoS ONE 20140604 2014
Previous research has identified modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults. Research is limited on the potential link between these risk factors and subjective memory impairment (SMI), which may precede AD and other dementias. Examination of these potential relationships may help identify those at risk for AD at a stage when interventions may delay or prevent further memory problems. The objective of this study was to determine whether risk factors for AD are associated with SMI among different age groups. Trained interviewers conducted daily telephone surveys (Gallup-Healthways) of a representative community sample of 18,614 U.S. respondents, including 4,425 younger (age 18 to 39 years), 6,365 middle-aged (40 to 59 years), and 7,824 older (60 to 99 years) adults. The surveyors collected data on demographics, lifestyles, and medical information. Less education, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, less exercise, obesity and depression, and interactions among them, were examined for associations with SMI. Weighted logistic regressions and chi-square tests were used to calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals for SMI with each risk factor and pairwise interactions across age groups. Depression, less education, less exercise, and hypertension were significantly associated with SMI in all three age groups. Several interactions between risk factors were significant in younger and middle-aged adults and influenced their associations with SMI. Frequency of SMI increased with age and number of risk factors. Odds of having SMI increased significantly with just having one risk factor. These results indicate that modifiable risk factors for AD are also associated with SMI, suggesting that these relationships occur in a broad range of ages and may be targeted to mitigate further memory problems. Whether modifying these risk factors reduces SMI and the eventual incidence of AD and other dementias later in life remains to be determined. 
24882360	Interaction of Grb2 SH3 domain with UVRAG in an Alzheimer's disease-like scenario.
Biochem. Cell Biol. 20140424 2014Jun
Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) is an adaptor protein which participates in trafficking pathways alongside its role in signaling. Proteins important for actin remodeling and cellular compartmentalization contain SRC Homology 3 (SH3) binding motifs that interact with Grb2. While studying the Grb2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) interaction in Alzheimer's disease cell line models, it was seen that Grb2 colocalized to compartments that mature into autophagosomes. The entrapping of AICD in the Grb2 vesicles and its clearance via autophagosomes was a survival contrivance on the part of the cell. Here, we report that Grb2, when in excess, interacts with ultraviolet radiation resistance-associated gene protein (UVRAG) under excess conditions of AICD-Grb2 or Grb2. The N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 specifically interacts with UVRAG, unlike the C-terminal SH3 domain. This interaction helps to understand the role of Grb2 in the autophagic maturation of vesicles.  
24188046	Vascular factors are associated with the severity of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Neurosci. 20131113 2014Jul
The purpose of this study is to determine whether vascular risk factors are associated with severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in patients of Alzheimer's dementia. We reviewed medical records of 162 patients with Alzheimer's dementia. The NPS were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Hypertension and cardiovascular events were detected through detailed history taking. Diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia were uncovered through laboratory test. The asymptomatic stroke and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were defined by magnetic resonance imaging. Partial correlation analysis was used. Hypertension was correlated with the severity of apathy (r = 0.231, p = 0.015). The asymptomatic stroke was related to the severity of depression (r = 0.255, p = 0.007). The remaining vascular factors were not significant. Presence of hypertension and asymptomatic stroke are related with the severity of apathy and depression in Alzheimer's dementia. 
24934666	Platelets, a reliable source for peripheral Alzheimer's disease biomarkers?
Acta Neuropathol Commun 20140616 2014
Peripheral biomarkers play an indispensable role in quick and reliable diagnoses of any kind of disease. With the population ageing, the number of people suffering from age-related diseases is expected to rise dramatically over the coming decades. In particular, all types of cognitive deficits, such as Alzheimer's disease, will increase. Alzheimer's disease is characterised mainly by coexistence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain. Reliable identification of such molecular characteristics antemortem, however, is problematic due to restricted availability of appropriate sample material and definitive diagnosis is only possible postmortem. Currently, the best molecular biomarkers available for antemortem diagnosis originate from cerebrospinal fluid. Though, this is not convenient for routine diagnosis because of the required invasive lumbar puncture. As a consequence, there is a growing demand for additional peripheral biomarkers in a more readily accessible sample material. Blood platelets, due to shared biochemical properties with neurons, can constitute an attractive alternative as discussed here. This review summarises potential platelet Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, their role, implication, and alteration in the disease. For easy comparison of their performance, the Hedge effect size was calculated whenever data were available.  
25009697	Houttuynia cordata Improves Cognitive Deficits in Cholinergic Dysfunction Alzheimer's Disease-Like Models.
Biomol Ther (Seoul)  2014May
Cognitive impairment is a result of dementia of diverse causes, such as cholinergic dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) has long been used as a traditional herbal medicine. It has biological activities including protective effects against amyloid beta (AÎ²) toxicity, via regulation of calcium homeostasis, in rat hippocampal cells. To extend previous reports, we investigated the effects of water extracts of H. cordata herb (HCW) on tauopathies, also involving calcium influx. We then confirmed the effects of HCW in improving memory impairment and neuronal damage in mice with AÎ²-induced neurotoxicity. We also investigated the effects of HCW against scopolamine-induced cholinergic dysfunction in mice. In primary neuronal cells, HCW inhibited the phosphorylation of tau by regulating p25/p35 expression in AÎ²-induced neurotoxicity. In mice with AÎ²-induced neurotoxicity, HCW improved cognitive impairment, as assessed with behavioral tasks, such as novel object recognition, Y-maze, and passive avoidance tasks. HCW also inhibited the degeneration of neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in AÎ²-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, HCW, which had an IC50 value of 79.7 Î¼g/ml for acetylcholinesterase inhibition, ameliorated scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment significantly in Y-maze and passive avoidance tasks. These results indicate that HCW improved cognitive impairment, due to cholinergic dysfunction, with inhibitory effects against tauopathies and cholinergic antagonists, suggesting that HCW may be an interesting candidate to investigate for the treatment of AD.  
25009495	Glia and zinc in ageing and Alzheimer's disease: a mechanism for cognitive decline?
Front Aging Neurosci 20140625 2014
Normal ageing is characterized by cognitive decline across a range of neurological functions, which are further impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, alterations in zinc (Zn) concentrations, particularly at the synapse, have emerged as a potential mechanism underlying the cognitive changes that occur in both ageing and AD. Zn is now accepted as a potent neuromodulator, affecting a variety of signaling pathways at the synapse that are critical to normal cognition. While the focus has principally been on the neuron: Zn interaction, there is a growing literature suggesting that glia may also play a modulatory role in maintaining both Zn ion homeostasis and the normal function of the synapse. Indeed, zinc transporters (ZnT's) have been demonstrated in glial cells where Zn has also been shown to have a role in signaling. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the pathogenesis of AD critically involves glial cells (such as astrocytes), which have been reported to contribute to amyloid-beta (AÎ²) neurotoxicity. This review discusses the current evidence supporting a complex interplay of glia, Zn dyshomeostasis and synaptic function in ageing and AD.  
25009480	Frontal and temporal lobe contributions to emotional enhancement of memory in behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Front Behav Neurosci 20140624 2014
Emotional events gain special priority in how they are remembered, with emotionally arousing events typically recalled more vividly and with greater confidence than non-emotional events. In dementia, memory and emotion processing are affected to varying degrees, however, whether emotional enhancement of memory for complex ecologically-valid events is differentially affected across dementia syndromes remains unclear, with previous studies examining effects of emotion on simple visual recognition only. Here, we examined memory for an emotionally arousing short story and a closely matched, emotionally neutral story in behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (n = 13) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 14), and contrasted their performance with healthy controls (n = 12). Multiple-choice recognition memory for specific details of the story was assessed after a 1-h delay. While AD and control groups showed enhanced memory for the emotional story, the bvFTD group recalled a similar number of details from the emotional and neutral stories. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed emotional enhancement of memory correlated with distinct brain regions in each patient group. In AD, emotional enhancement was associated with integrity of the bilateral hippocampus, parahippocampal gyri, temporal fusiform gyrus and frontal pole, regions typically implicated in memory processes. In contrast in bvFTD, integrity of emotion processing regions, including the orbitofrontal cortex, right amygdala and right insula, correlated with the extent emotion enhanced memory. Our results reveal that integrity of frontal and temporal regions determine the quality and nature of emotional memories. While emotional enhancement of memory is present in mild AD, in bvFTD emotion does not facilitate memory retrieval for complex realistic events. This attenuation of emotional enhancement is due to degradation of emotion processing regions, which may be important for modulating levels of arousal in response to emotional events in these patients.  
25009454	Histone-acetylation: a link between Alzheimer's disease and post-traumatic stress disorder?
Front Neurosci 20140624 2014
The orchestration of gene-expression programs is essential for cellular homeostasis. Epigenetic processes provide to the cell a key mechanism that allows the regulation of gene-expression networks in response to environmental stimuli. Recently epigenetic mechanisms such as histone-modifications have been implicated with cognitive function and altered epigenome plasticity has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Thus, key regulators of epigenetic gene-expression have emerged as novel drug targets for brain diseases. Numerous recent review articles discuss in detail the current findings of epigenetic processes in brain diseases. The aim of this article is not to give yet another comprehensive overview of the field but to specifically address the question why the same epigenetic therapies that target histone-acetylation may be suitable to treat seemingly different diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and post-traumatic stress disorder.  
25009496	Successful therapies for Alzheimer's disease: why so many in animal models and none in humans?
Front Pharmacol 20140625 2014
Peering into the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the outsider realizes that many of the therapeutic strategies tested (in animal models) have been successful. One also may notice that there is a deficit in translational research, i.e., to take a successful drug in mice and translate it to the patient. Efforts are still focused on novel projects to expand the therapeutic arsenal to "cure mice." Scientific reasons behind so many successful strategies are not obvious. This article aims to review the current approaches to combat AD and to open a debate on common mechanisms of cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. In short, either the rodent models are not good and should be discontinued, or we should extract the most useful information from those models. An example of a question that may be debated for the advancement in AD therapy is: In addition to reducing amyloid and tau pathologies, would it be necessary to boost synaptic strength and cognition? The debate could provide clues to turn around the current negative output in generating effective drugs for patients. Furthermore, discovery of biomarkers in human body fluids, and a clear distinction between cognitive enhancers and disease modifying strategies, should be instrumental for advancing in anti-AD drug discovery.  
24283798	Simultaneous determination of post-translational racemization and isomerization of N-terminal amyloid-Î² in Alzheimer's brain tissues by covalent chiral derivatized ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
Anal. Chem. 20131209 2014Jan7
Typical markers of protein aging are spontaneous post-translational modifications such as amino acid racemization (AAR) and amino acid isomerization (AAI) during the degradation of peptides. The post-translational AAR and AAI could significantly induce the density and localization of plaque deposition in brain tissues. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reliably related to the formation and aggregation of amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) plaques in the human brain. No current analytical methods can simultaneously determine AAR and AAI during the degradation of AÎ² from AD patients. We now report a covalent chiral derivatized ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (CCD-UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of post-translational AAR and AAI of N-terminal AÎ² (N-AÎ²1-5) in human brain tissues. When subjected to tryptic N-AÎ²1-5 from post-translationally modified natural AÎ² in focal brain tissues by the CCD procedure, it was monitored at m/z 989.6â†’637.0/678.9 during electrospray collision-induced dissociation. These N-AÎ²1-5 fragments with l-aspartic acid (l-Asp), d-Asp, l-isoAsp, and d-isoAsp could be separated using the UPLC system with a conventional reversed-phase column and mobile phase. The quantification of these peptides was determined using a stable isotope [(15)N]-labeled AÎ²1-40 internal standard. The CCD-UPLC-MS/MS assay of potential N-AÎ²1-5 allowed for the discovery of the present and ratio levels of these N-AÎ²1-5 sequences with l-Asp, d-Asp, l-isoAsp, and d-isoAsp.  
24513181	Elevated brain aluminium and early onset Alzheimer's disease in an individual occupationally exposed to aluminium: a case report.
J Med Case Rep 20140210 2014
Aluminium is a known neurotoxin and occupational exposure to aluminium has been implicated in neurological disease including Alzheimer's disease. Here we present the first comprehensive and unequivocal data demonstrating significantly elevated brain aluminium content in an individual occupationally exposed to aluminium. A 66-year-old Caucasian man who died with Alzheimer's disease showed significantly elevated brain aluminium content, 2.98 (2.73) Î¼g/g dry weight, nâ€‰=â€‰46, following occupational exposure to aluminium over a period of 8 years. That the individual developed an early onset aggressive form of Alzheimer's disease suggests a role for aluminium in disease aetiology. That the exposure to aluminium was through occupational exposure to aluminium dust suggests a prominent role for the olfactory system and lungs in the accumulation of aluminium in the brain. 
24531152	Paradoxical effect of TrkA inhibition in Alzheimer's disease models.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
An unbiased screen for compounds that block amyloid-Î² protein precursor (AÎ²PP) caspase cleavage identified ADDN-1351, which reduced AÎ²PP-C31 by 90%. Target identification studies showed that ADDN-1351 is a TrkA inhibitor, and, in complementary studies, TrkA overexpression increased AÎ²PP-C31 and cell death. TrkA was shown to interact with AÎ²PP and suppress AÎ²PP-mediated transcriptional activation. Moreover, treatment of PDAPP transgenic mice with the known TrkA inhibitor GW441756 increased sAÎ²PPÎ± and the sAÎ²PPÎ± to AÎ² ratio. These results suggest TrkA inhibition-rather than NGF activation-as a novel therapeutic approach, and raise the possibility that such an approach may counteract the hyperactive signaling resulting from the accumulation of active NGF-TrkA complexes due to reduced retrograde transport. The results also suggest that one component of an optimal therapy for Alzheimer's disease may be a TrkA inhibitor.  
24797360	Profiles of extracellular miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid and serum from patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases correlate with disease status and features of pathology.
PLoS ONE 20140505 2014
The discovery and reliable detection of markers for neurodegenerative diseases have been complicated by the inaccessibility of the diseased tissue--such as the inability to biopsy or test tissue from the central nervous system directly. RNAs originating from hard to access tissues, such as neurons within the brain and spinal cord, have the potential to get to the periphery where they can be detected non-invasively. The formation and extracellular release of microvesicles and RNA binding proteins have been found to carry RNA from cells of the central nervous system to the periphery and protect the RNA from degradation. Extracellular miRNAs detectable in peripheral circulation can provide information about cellular changes associated with human health and disease. In order to associate miRNA signals present in cell-free peripheral biofluids with neurodegenerative disease status of patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, we assessed the miRNA content in cerebrospinal fluid and serum from postmortem subjects with full neuropathology evaluations. We profiled the miRNA content from 69 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 67 with Parkinson's disease and 78 neurologically normal controls using next generation small RNA sequencing (NGS). We report the average abundance of each detected miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid and in serum and describe 13 novel miRNAs that were identified. We correlated changes in miRNA expression with aspects of disease severity such as Braak stage, dementia status, plaque and tangle densities, and the presence and severity of Lewy body pathology. Many of the differentially expressed miRNAs detected in peripheral cell-free cerebrospinal fluid and serum were previously reported in the literature to be deregulated in brain tissue from patients with neurodegenerative disease. These data indicate that extracellular miRNAs detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum are reflective of cell-based changes in pathology and can be used to assess disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. 
24423328	Exploring the role of vitamin D in type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer disease: new insights from accurate analysis of 10 forms.
J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 20140113 2014Mar
A comprehensive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed to quantify 10 forms of vitamin D in sera from healthy adults and patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1-D), and Alzheimer disease (AD). The rapid assay, validated according to US Food and Drug Administration guidelines with Chromsystems and DEQAS samples, was applied to 36 nonhealthy sera samples (41.7% male, age range of 14-95, mean = 54.00 Â± 21.98 years), consisting of individuals with RA, T1-D, and AD (n = 12 each) and was compared to samples from 32 healthy individuals (50% male, age range of 19-90, mean = 58.83 Â± 22.93 years). The key findings are (1) the 23R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 form was quantified for the first time (healthy = 0.427 Â± 0.633 nmol/L; combined disease = 0.395 Â± 0.483 nmol/L), (2) the 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolite was found in all groups with significantly higher concentration in the diseased samples [healthy = 6.093 Â± 6.711 nmol/L; combined disease = 22.433 Â± 13.535 nmol/L, t(52.5) = -6.411; P &lt; .001], (3) a significant difference was found for the active form (1Î±-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) between health (0.027 Â± 0.035 nmol/L) and disease (0.433 Â± 0.870 nmol/L) [t(35.1) = -2.797, P = 0.008], and (4) there was no significant correlation between the total circulating and total active forms in either the disease or healthy group (r = -0.180 and -0.274, respectively, with no difference between the correlation coefficients, z = -0.389, P = .697). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed good sensitivity and specificity for using the 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration to predict disease status (area under the curve = 0.880, P &lt; .001). Discriminant function analysis using concentrations of 23R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, and 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D classified 94.4% (91.7% in cross-validation) of the cases correctly. This study reveals significant differences between health and disease with epimers having the potential to relate to disease. The potential implications of the information gleaned from measuring all forms warrant application of more comprehensive assays for future clinical studies investigating the link between vitamin D and health. 
24900984	In silico design of BACE1 inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease by traditional Chinese medicine.
Biomed Res Int 20140508 2014
The Î²-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is an important target for causing Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to the brain deposition peptide amyloid beta (AÎ²) require cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 and Î³-secretase, but treatments of AD still have side effect in recent therapy. This study utilizes the world largest traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database and database screening to provide potential BACE1 inhibited compound. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out to observe the dynamics structure after ligand binding. We found that Triptofordin B1 has less toxicity than pyrimidine analogue, which has more potent binding affinity with BACE1. For trajectory analysis, all conformations are tending to be stable during 5000 ps simulation time. In dynamic protein validation, the residues of binding region are still stable after MD simulation. For snapshot comparison, we found that Triptofordin B1 could reduce the binding cavity; the results reveal that Triptofordin B1 could bind to BACE1 and better than control, which could be used as potential lead drug to design novel BACE1 inhibitor for AD therapy. 
24896354	An update on drug treatment options of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Biosci (Landmark Ed) 20140601 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive decrease in cognitive function and loss of short-term memory known to be associated with a dysfunction of the cholinergic system. The pathological hallmarks of AD are beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau. Hypercholesterolemia and disturbances in glucose metabolism are another risk factors. During the last two decades therapeutic strategies were mainly targeting the Abeta hypothesis. As this approach virtually failed to show a significant clinical benefit research on potential therapeutics has been shifted to tau pathology. However, also this approach has as yet not yielded in new therapeutics. Hence, rebalancing the cholinergic input to improve the cognitive symptoms of AD by inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) is still the only mechanistic target in addition to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade by memantine that can be addressed by currently approved medications. Despite the fact that the available AChE inhibitors are directed at an identical target they exhibit some pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features that should be considered when used clinically.  
24885270	Generating genius: how an Alzheimer's drug became considered a 'cognitive enhancer' for healthy individuals.
BMC Med Ethics 20140512 2014
Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, has been widely cited in media and bioethics literature on cognitive enhancement (CE) as having the potential to improve the cognitive ability of healthy individuals. In both literatures, this claim has been repeatedly supported by the results of a small study published by Yesavage et al. in 2002 on non-demented pilots (30-70 years old). The factors contributing to this specific interpretation of this study's results are unclear. We examined print media and interdisciplinary bioethics coverage of this small study, aiming to provide insight into how evidence from research may be shaped within different discourses, potentially influencing important policy, ethics, and clinical decisions. Systematic qualitative content analysis was used to examine how this study was reported in 27 media and 22 bioethics articles. Articles were analyzed for content related to: (1) headlines and titles; (2) colloquialisms; and, (3) accuracy of reporting of the characteristics and results of the study. In media and bioethics articles referencing this small study, strong claims were made about donepezil as a CE drug. The majority of headlines, titles, and colloquialisms used enhancement language and the majority of these suggest that donepezil could be used to enhance intellectual ability. Further, both literatures moved between reporting the results of the primary study and magnifying the perceived connection between these results and the CE debate that was alluded to in the primary study. Specific descriptions of the results overwhelmingly reported an improvement in performance on a flight simulator, while more general statements claimed donepezil enhanced cognitive performance. Further, a high level of reporting accuracy was found regarding study characteristics of the original study, but variable levels of accuracy surrounded the presentation of complex characteristics (i.e., methods) or contentious properties of the CE debate (i.e., initial health status of the study subjects). Hyped claims of CE effects cannot be completely accounted for by sheer inaccuracy in reporting. A complex interaction between the primary and secondary literature, and expectations and social pressures related to CE appears to drive enthusiastic reports. 
25013944	The role of singing familiar songs in encouraging conversation among people with middle to late stage Alzheimer's disease.
J Music Ther 20140619 2014Summer
Language deficits in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifest, among other things, in a gradual deterioration of spontaneous speech. People with AD tend to speak less as the disease progresses and their speech becomes confused. However, the ability to sing old tunes sometimes remains intact throughout the disease. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of singing familiar songs in encouraging conversation among people with middle to late stage AD. Six participants attended group music therapy sessions over a one-month period. Using content analysis, we qualitatively examined transcriptions of verbal and sung content during 8 group sessions for the purpose of understanding the relationship between specific songs and conversations that occurred during and following group singing. Content analysis revealed that songs from the participants' past-elicited memories, especially songs related to their social and national identity. Analyses also indicated that conversation related to the singing was extensive and the act of group singing encouraged spontaneous responses. After singing, group members expressed positive feelings, a sense of accomplishment, and belonging. Carefully selecting music from the participants' past can encourage conversation. Considering the failure in spontaneous speech in people with middle to late stage AD, it is important to emphasize that group members' responses to each other occurred spontaneously without the researcher's encouragement. 
25016769	[Neurobehavioral manifestation in early period of Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia].
Psychiatr. Pol.  2014 Mar-Apr
AD and VD are preceded by a preclinical stage. Small but tangible cognitive impairments sometimes occur many years before the onset and diagnosis ofdementia. The ongoing degenerative process can be conductive to behavioural and psychological symptoms. The aim of the study was to investigate the rates of neurobehavioral symptoms in the preclinical stages of AD and VD. Methods: Two hundred and ninety one residents of nursery homes were included in the study. Participants of the study did not display symptoms of dementia in accordance with DSM IV criteria and obtained at least 24 points on the MMSE scale and were on the first or second level of the Global Deterioration Scale. Participants were screened for behavioural and psychological symptoms with the NPI-NH scale, while their cognitive functioning was evaluated by means of the ADAS-cog. Participants of the study were evaluated with the MMSE scale annually. Participants who obtained less than 24 points on the MMSE scale were evaluated by a senior psychiatrist. Diagnosis of dementia was done on the basis of DSM criteria. Alzheimer's Disease was diagnosed on the basis of NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and vascular dementia on the NINDS-AIREN criteria. The study was carried out over a period of seven consecutive years. A hundred and fifty people were included in the final analysis--in 111 of them were found not to be afflicted with dementia, 25 were found to have AD and in 14 VD was diagnosed. The control group differed from the AD and VD group with respect to the initial level of cognitive impairment (ADAS-cog) and the intensity of behavioural and psychological symptoms (NPI -NH scale). Particular items of the NPI -NH scale differentiated the two groups to a different degree. In people with AD the greatest differences were observed with respect to agitation/aggression, mood swings, irritability/emotional liability and the rates of anxiety. People with VD, similarly to people with AD, significantly differed from the control group with respect to mood disorders and irritability/emotional liability, as well as disinhibition and anxiety. People with VD were found not have high rates of agitation/aggression. In the AD group, the shorter the period between the evaluation with the NPI-NH scale and the diagnosis of AD was the greater the rates of agitation/aggression, anxiety, and elevated mood/euphoria were. In preclinical stages of both AD and VD behavioural and psychological symptoms occur very frequently. The closer the diagnosis of dementia is the greater the possibility of behavioural and psychological symptoms occurring, especially in AD. 
24440570	Hyperleucinemia causes hippocampal retromer deficiency linking diabetes to Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20140114 2014May
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A variety of metabolic changes related to T2D (e.g. hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and elevated branched-chain amino acids) have been proposed as mechanistic links, but the basis for this association remains unknown. Retromer-dependent trafficking is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, and two key retromer proteins, VPS35 and VPS26, are deficient in the hippocampal formation of AD patients. We characterized VPS35 levels in five different mouse models of T2D/obesity to identify specific metabolic factors that could affect retromer levels in the brain. Mouse models in which hyperleucinemia was present displayed hippocampus-selective retromer deficiency. Wild-type lean mice fed a high leucine diet also developed hippocampal-selective retromer deficiency, and neuronal-like cells grown in high ambient leucine had reduced retromer complex proteins. Our results suggest that hyperleucinemia may account, in part, for the association of insulin resistance/T2D with AD.  
24608822	Antidementia drug use among community-dwelling individuals with Alzheimer's disease in Finland: a nationwide register-based study.
Int Clin Psychopharmacol  2014Jul
The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and memantine use, duration of treatment, concomitant use of these drugs, and factors associated with the discontinuation of AChEI therapy during 2006-2009. We utilized data from a nationwide sample of community-dwelling individuals with a clinically verified Alzheimer's disease diagnosed during the year 2005 (n=6858) as a part of the MEDALZ-2005 study. During the 4-year follow-up, 84% used AChEI and 47% used memantine. Altogether, 22% of the sample used both drugs concomitantly. The median duration of the first AChEI use period was 860 (interquartile range 295-1458) days and 1103 (interquartile range 489-1487) days for the total duration of AChEI use. Although 20% of the AChEI users discontinued the use during the first year, over half of them restarted later. The risk of discontinuation was higher for rivastigmine [hazard ratio 1.34 (confidence interval 1.22-1.48)] and galantamine users [hazard ratio 1.23 (confidence interval 1.15-1.37)] compared with donepezil users in the adjusted model. In conclusion, median time for AChEI use was over 3 years and every fifth Alzheimer's disease patient used AChEI and memantine concomitantly during the follow-up. The low rate of discontinuation is consistent with the Finnish Care Guideline but in contrast to the results reported from many other countries.  
24390130	Familial Alzheimer's mutations within APPTM increase AÎ²42 production by enhancing accessibility of Îµ-cleavage site.
Nat Commun  2014
The high AÎ²42/AÎ²40 production ratio is a hallmark of familial Alzheimer's disease, which can be caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The C-terminus of AÎ² is generated by Î³-secretase cleavage within the transmembrane domain of APP (APPTM), a process that is primed by an initial Îµ-cleavage at either T48 or L49, resulting in subsequent production of AÎ²42 or AÎ²40, respectively. Here we solve the dimer structures of wild-type APPTM (AAPTM WT) and mutant APPTM (FAD mutants V44M) with solution NMR. The right-handed APPTM helical dimer is mediated by GXXXA motif. From the NMR structural and dynamic data, we show that the V44M and V44A mutations can selectively expose the T48 site by weakening helical hydrogen bonds and increasing hydrogen-deuterium exchange rate (kex). We propose a structural model in which FAD mutations (V44M and V44A) can open the T48 site Î³-secretase for the initial Îµ-cleavage, and consequently shift cleavage preference towards AÎ²42.  
24491056	[Effects of tanshinone IIA on the expressions of caspase-3, Akt and NF-ÎºB in the brains of rat models of Alzheimer's disease].
Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi  2014Feb
To observe the effects of tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) on the expressions of serine/threonine kinase Akt, nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and caspase-3 in the brain tissues of rat models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups (n=10 per group): Sham group, AD group, Tan IIA treatment group. The models of AD were established by injecting Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) into the hippocampus of rats. The location and expression level of AÎ²1-16; was observed by immunofluorescence, the expression level of caspase-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expression levels of Akt and NF-ÎºB were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. There was no AÎ²1-16; detected in the control group, and the difference in the expression level of AÎ²1-16; between AD group and Tan IIA treatment group was not significant statistically (P&gt;0.05); The expression of Akt in AD group was lower than that in the control group and the Tan IIA treatment group, and the difference between AD group and the other two groups was of statistical significance (P&lt;0.05). Conversely, compared with Tan IIA treatment group and sham group, the AD group was significantly higher in the expression levels of NF-ÎºB and caspase-3 (P&lt;0.05). Tan IIA can up-regulate the expression of Akt and inhibit the production of NF-ÎºB and caspase-3 in the model rats with AD. 
24408842	A 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease in Europe : predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS study.
CNS Drugs  2014Feb
There is no consensus on when and how to discontinue cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI). Predictors of non-persistency of antidementia drugs have been poorly investigated, mostly during short-term periods and using administrative data. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and predictors of ChEI switch and discontinuation among subjects with ascertained Alzheimer's disease (AD). A total of 557 community-dwelling, mild-to-moderate AD subjects initiating ChEIs in 29 European clinic centres were assessed twice-yearly for 2 years. Antidementia drug exposure was recorded through a physician-administered structured questionnaire to document any change in drug therapy (start and stop dates, reasons). Discontinuation was defined as &gt;35 days without any antidementia drug. Switch was defined as a change for any antidementia drug strategy within 35 days after ChEI cessation. Two separate time-dependent multivariate Cox survival analyses were conducted to identify predictors of discontinuation and switch. The incidences of discontinuation and switch were 9.65 and 12.47/100 person-years, respectively. Behavioural disturbances, low body mass index, falls, decline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and AD-related hospitalization predicted discontinuation. MMSE score, decline in activities of daily living score, aberrant motor behaviour, shorter AD duration and higher nurse resource use predicted a switch. An ineffective ChEI dose and clinic specialty predicted both outcomes. Sensitivity analyses using a 60-day cut-off provided stable results. Several predictors were identified: adverse drug events and their predisposing factors, perceived loss of efficacy or disease progression on cognitive or functional scales, behavioural disturbances, hospitalization and professional practices. The latter implies a need for harmonization in AD drug prescription practice. 
24849345	1Î±,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 reduces cerebral amyloid-Î² accumulation and improves cognition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurosci.  2014May21
We demonstrate a role of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in reducing cerebral soluble and insoluble amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides. Short-term treatment of two human amyloid precursor protein-expressing models, Tg2576 and TgCRND8 mice, with 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the endogenous active ligand of VDR, resulted in higher brain P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and lower soluble AÎ² levels, effects negated with coadministration of elacridar, a P-gp inhibitor. Long-term treatment of TgCRND8 mice with 1,25(OH)2D3 during the period of plaque formation reduced soluble and insoluble plaque-associated AÎ², particularly in the hippocampus in which the VDR is abundant and P-gp induction is greatest after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, and this led to improved conditioned fear memory. In mice fed a vitamin D-deficient diet, lower cerebral P-gp expression was observed, but levels were restored on replenishment with VDR ligands. The composite data suggest that the VDR is an important therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  
24849348	Loss of MAP function leads to hippocampal synapse loss and deficits in the Morris Water Maze with aging.
J. Neurosci.  2014May21
Hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau aggregates are prominent features in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, but the impact of loss of tau function on synaptic and cognitive deficits remains poorly understood. We report that old (19-20 months; OKO) but not middle-aged (8-9 months; MKO) tau knock-out mice develop Morris Water Maze (MWM) deficits and loss of hippocampal acetylated Î±-tubulin and excitatory synaptic proteins. Mild motor deficits and reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra were present by middle age, but did not affect MWM performance, whereas OKO mice showed MWM deficits paralleling hippocampal deficits. Deletion of tau, a microtubule-associated protein (MAP), resulted in increased levels of MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2 in MKO, followed by loss of MAP2 and MAP1B in OKO. Hippocampal synaptic deficits in OKO mice were partially corrected with dietary supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and both MWM and synaptic deficits were fully corrected by combining DHA with Î±-lipoic acid (ALA), which also prevented TH loss. DHA or DHA/ALA restored phosphorylated and total GSK3Î² and attenuated hyperactivation of the tau C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) while increasing MAP1B, dephosphorylated (active) MAP2, and acetylated Î±-tubulin, suggesting improved microtubule stability and maintenance of active compensatory MAPs. Our results implicate the loss of MAP function in age-associated hippocampal deficits and identify a safe dietary intervention, rescuing both MAP function and TH in OKO mice. Therefore, in addition to microtubule-stabilizing therapeutic drugs, preserving or restoring compensatory MAP function may be a useful new prevention strategy.  
24849358	The systemic amyloid precursor transthyretin (TTR) behaves as a neuronal stress protein regulated by HSF1 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and APP23 Alzheimer's disease model mice.
J. Neurosci.  2014May21
Increased neuronal synthesis of transthyretin (TTR) may favorably impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) because TTR has been shown to inhibit AÎ² aggregation and detoxify cell-damaging conformers. The mechanism whereby hippocampal and cortical neurons from AD patients and APP23 AD model mice produce more TTR is unknown. We now show that TTR expression in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, primary hippocampal neurons and the hippocampus of APP23 mice, is significantly enhanced by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated occupation of TTR promoter heat shock elements by HSF1 in APP23 hippocampi, primary murine hippocampal neurons, and SH-SY5Y cells, but not in mouse liver, cultured human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, or AC16 cultured human cardiomyocytes. Treating SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with heat shock or the HSF1 stimulator celastrol increased TTR transcription in parallel with that of HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90. With both treatments, ChIP showed increased occupancy of heat shock elements in the TTR promoter by HSF1. In vivo celastrol increased the HSF1 ChIP signal in hippocampus but not in liver. Transfection of a human HSF1 construct into SH-SY5Y cells increased TTR transcription and protein production, which could be blocked by shHSF1 antisense. The effect is neuron specific. In cultured HepG2 cells, HSF1 was either suppressive or had no effect on TTR expression confirming the differential effects of HSF1 on TTR transcription in different cell types.  
24849360	Anti-ApoE antibody given after plaque onset decreases AÎ² accumulation and improves brain function in a mouse model of AÎ² amyloidosis.
J. Neurosci.  2014May21
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). It influences amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) clearance and aggregation, which likely contributes in large part to its role in AD pathogenesis. We recently found that HJ6.3, a monoclonal antibody against apoE, significantly reduced AÎ² plaque load when given to APPswe/PS1Î”E9 (APP/PS1) mice starting before the onset of plaque deposition. To determine whether the anti-apoE antibody HJ6.3 affects AÎ² plaques, neuronal network function, and behavior in APP/PS1 mice after plaque onset, we administered HJ6.3 (10 mg/kg/week) or PBS intraperitoneally to 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice for 21 weeks. HJ6.3 mildly improved spatial learning performance in the water maze, restored resting-state functional connectivity, and modestly reduced brain AÎ² plaque load. There was no effect of HJ6.3 on total plasma cholesterol or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of anti-apoE immunotherapy, HJ6.3 was applied to the brain cortical surface and amyloid deposition was followed over 2 weeks using in vivo imaging. Acute exposure to HJ6.3 affected the course of amyloid deposition in that it prevented the formation of new amyloid deposits, limited their growth, and was associated with occasional clearance of plaques, a process likely associated with direct binding to amyloid aggregates. Topical application of HJ6.3 for only 14 d also decreased the density of amyloid plaques assessed postmortem. Collectively, these studies suggest that anti-apoE antibodies have therapeutic potential when given before or after the onset of AÎ² pathology.  
24499394	Cognitive-behavioural group therapy improves a psychophysiological marker of stress in caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Aging Ment Health 20140205 2014
Family caregivers of patients with dementia frequently experience psychological stress, depression and disturbed psychophysiological activity, with increased levels of diurnal cortisol secretion. To compare the effects of a cognitive-behavioural group therapy (CBT) to a psychoeducation group programme (EDUC) on cortisol secretion in caregivers of patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Caregivers of AD outpatients were semi-randomly allocated to one of two intervention programmes (CBT or EDUC) consisting of eight weekly sessions. Twenty-six participants completed the study. Before and after intervention, salivary cortisol was collected at four different times of the day. Effects of the interventions were evaluated with self-report psychological scales and questionnaires related to functional abilities and neuropsychiatric symptoms of the AD relative. Only in the CBT group did salivary cortisol levels significantly decrease after intervention, with a large effect size and high achieved power. Both groups reported a reduction of neuropsychiatric symptoms of their AD relative after intervention. Psychoeducation for caregivers may contribute to a reduction of neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD patients while CBT additionally attenuates psychophysiological responses to stressful situations in caregivers, by reducing diurnal cortisol levels. This may lead to a positive impact in the general health of the caregiver, eventually resulting in better care of the AD patient. 
24788522	Genetic variation at the CELF1 (CUGBP, elav-like family member 1 gene) locus is genome-wide associated with Alzheimer's disease and obesity.
Am. J. Med. Genet. B Neuropsychiatr. Genet. 20140501 2014Jun
Deviations from normal body weight are observed prior to and after the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Midlife obesity confers increased AD risk in later life, whereas late-life obesity is associated with decreased AD risk. The role of underweight and weight loss for AD risk is controversial. Based on the hypothesis of shared genetic variants for both obesity and AD, we analyzed the variants identified for AD or obesity from genome-wide association meta-analyses of the GERAD (AD, casesâ€‰=â€‰6,688, controlsâ€‰=â€‰13,685) and GIANT (body mass index [BMI] as measure of obesity, nâ€‰=â€‰123,865) consortia. Our cross-disorder analysis of genome-wide significant 39 obesity SNPs and 23 AD SNPs in these two large data sets revealed that: (1) The AD SNP rs10838725 (pAD â€‰=â€‰1.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-08)) at the locus CELF1 is also genome-wide significant for obesity (pBMI â€‰=â€‰7.35â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-09) ). (2) Four additional AD risk SNPs were nominally associated with obesity (rs17125944 at FERMT2, pBMI â€‰=â€‰4.03â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-05), pBMIâ€‰corr â€‰=â€‰2.50â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-03) ; rs3851179 at PICALM; pBMI â€‰=â€‰0.002, rs2075650 at TOMM40/APOE, pBMI â€‰=â€‰0.024, rs3865444 at CD33, pBMI â€‰=â€‰0.024). (3) SNPs at two of the obesity risk loci (rs4836133 downstream of ZNF608; pAD â€‰=â€‰0.002 and at rs713586 downstream of RBJ/DNAJC27; pAD â€‰=â€‰0.018) were nominally associated with AD risk. Additionally, among the SNPs used for confirmation in both studies the AD risk allele of rs1858973, with an AD association just below genome-wide significance (pAD â€‰=â€‰7.20â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-07)), was also associated with obesity (SNP at IQCK/GPRC5B; pBMI â€‰=â€‰5.21â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-06) ; pcorr â€‰=â€‰3.24â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-04)). Our first GWAS based cross-disorder analysis for AD and obesity suggests that rs10838725 at the locus CELF1 might be relevant for both disorders. 
24716655	PET imaging of amyloid with Florbetapir F 18 and PET imaging of dopamine degeneration with 18F-AV-133 (florbenazine) in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disorders.
BMC Neurol 20140409 2014
Biomarkers based on the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) have the potential to improve diagnosis and understanding of the substrate for cognitive impairment in these disorders. The objective of this study was to compare the patterns of amyloid and dopamine PET imaging in patients with AD, DLB and Parkinson's disease (PD) using the amyloid imaging agent florbetapir F 18 and 18F-AV-133 (florbenazine), a marker for vesicular monamine type 2 transporters (VMAT2). Patients with DLB and AD, Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls (HC) were recruited for this study. On separate days, subjects received intravenous injections of florbetapir, and florbenazine. Amyloid burden and VMAT2 density were assessed quantitatively and by binary clinical interpretation. Imaging results for both tracers were compared across the four individual diagnostic groups and for combined groups based on underlying pathology (AD/DLB vs. PD/HC for amyloid burden and PD/DLB vs. AD/HC for VMAT binding) and correlated with measures of cognition and parkinsonism. 11 DLB, 10Â AD, 5 PD, and 5 controls participated in the study. Amyloid binding was significantly higher in the combined AD/DLB patient group (nâ€‰=â€‰21) compared to the PD/HC groups (nâ€‰=â€‰10, mean SUVr: 1.42 vs. 1.07; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0006). VMAT2 density was significantly lower in the PD/DLB group (nâ€‰=â€‰16) compared to the AD/ HC group (nâ€‰=â€‰15; 1.83 vs. 2.97; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001). Within the DLB group, there was a significant correlation between cognitive performance and striatal florbenazine binding (râ€‰=â€‰0.73; pâ€‰=â€‰0.011). The results of this study show significant differences in both florbetapir and florbenazine imaging that are consistent with expected pathology. In addition, VMAT density correlated significantly with cognitive impairment in DLB patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00857506, registered March 5, 2009). 
24773620	U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) aggregate in Alzheimer's disease due to autosomal dominant genetic mutations and trisomy 21.
Mol Neurodegener 20140428 2014
We recently identified U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) tangle-like aggregates and RNA splicing abnormalities in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). However little is known about snRNP biology in early onset AD due to autosomal dominant genetic mutations or trisomy 21 in Down syndrome. Therefore we investigated snRNP biochemical and pathologic features in these disorders. We performed quantitative proteomics and immunohistochemistry in postmortem brain from genetic AD cases. Electron microscopy was used to characterize ultrastructural features of pathologic aggregates. U1-70k and other snRNPs were biochemically enriched in the insoluble fraction of human brain from subjects with presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations. Aggregates of U1 snRNP-immunoreactivity formed cytoplasmic tangle-like structures in cortex of AD subjects with PS1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations as well as trisomy 21. Ultrastructural analysis with electron microscopy in an APP mutation case demonstrated snRNP immunogold labeling of paired helical filaments (PHF). These studies identify U1 snRNP pathologic changes in brain of early onset genetic forms of AD. Since dominant genetic mutations and trisomy 21 result in dysfunctional amyloid processing, the findings suggest that aberrant Î²-amyloid processing may influence U1 snRNP aggregate formation. 
24885474	Early intervention in Alzheimer's disease: a health economic study of the effects of diagnostic timing.
BMC Neurol 20140507 2014
Intervention and treatment in Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD-dementia) can be cost effective but the majority of patients are not diagnosed in a timely manner. Technology is now available that can enable the earlier detection of cognitive loss associated with incipient dementia, offering the potential for earlier intervention in the UK health care system. This study aimed to determine to what extent the timing of an intervention affects its cost-effectiveness. Using published data describing cognitive decline in the years prior to an AD diagnosis, we modelled the effects on healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years of hypothetical symptomatic and disease-modifying interventions. Early and standard interventions were assumed to have equal clinical effects, but the early intervention could be applied up to eight years prior to standard diagnosis. A symptomatic treatment which immediately improved cognition by one MMSE point and reduced in efficacy over three years, would produce a maximum net benefit when applied at the earliest timepoint considered, i.e. eight years prior to standard diagnosis. In this scenario, the net benefit was reduced by around 17% for every year that intervention was delayed. In contrast, for a disease-modifying intervention which halted cognitive decline for one year, economic benefits would peak when treatment effects were applied two years prior to standard diagnosis. In these models, the maximum net benefit of the disease modifying intervention was fifteen times larger than that of the symptomatic treatment. Timeliness of intervention is likely to have an important impact on the cost-effectiveness of both current and future treatments. Healthcare policy should aim to optimise the timing of AD-dementia diagnosis, which is likely to necessitate detecting and treating patients several years prior to current clinical practice. 
24885952	Probable novel PSEN2 Val214Leu mutation in Alzheimer's disease supported by structural prediction.
BMC Neurol 20140515 2014
PSEN2 mutations are rare variants, and fewer than 30 different PSEN2 mutations have been found. So far, it has not been reported in Asia. PSEN2 mutation at codon 214 for predicting a valine to leucine substitution was found in a 70-year-old woman, who showed a dementia of the Alzheimer type. We did not find the mutation in 614 control chromosomes. We also predicted the structures of presenilin 2 protein with native Val 214 residue and Leu 214 mutation, which revealed significant structural changes in the region. It could be a novel mutation verified with structural prediction in a patient with Alzheimer's disease. 
24885175	Increased mtDNA mutations with aging promotes amyloid accumulation and brain atrophy in the APP/Ld transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol Neurodegener 20140502 2014
The role of mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated in age-related brain pathology, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction may cause neurodegeneration in AD is unclear. To model mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo, we utilized mice that harbor a knockin mutation that inactivates the proofreading function of mitochondrial DNA polymerase Î³ (PolgA D257A), so that these mice accumulate mitochondrial DNA mutations with age. PolgA D257A mice develop a myriad of mitochondrial bioenergetic defects and physical phenotypes that mimic premature ageing, with subsequent death around one year of age. We crossed the D257A mice with a well-established transgenic AD mouse model (APP/Ld) that develops amyloid plaques. We hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction would affect AÎ² synthesis and/or clearance, thus contributing to amyloidogenesis and triggering neurodegeneration. Initially, we discovered that AÎ²42 levels along with AÎ²42 plaque density were increased in D257A; APP/Ld bigenic mice compared to APP/Ld monogenic mice. Elevated AÎ² production was not responsible for increased amyloid pathology, as levels of BACE1, PS1, C99, and C83 were unchanged in D257A; APP/Ld compared to APP/Ld mice. However, the levels of a major AÎ² clearance enzyme, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), were reduced in mice with the D257A mutation, suggesting this as mechanism for increased amyloid load. In the presence of the APP transgene, D257A mice also exhibited significant brain atrophy with apparent cortical thinning but no frank neuron loss. D257A; APP/Ld mice had increased levels of 17Â kDa cleaved caspase-3 and p25, both indicative of neurodegeneration. Moreover, D257A; APP/Ld neurons appeared morphologically disrupted, with swollen and vacuolated nuclei. Overall, our results implicate synergism between the effects of the PolgA D257A mutation and AÎ² in causing neurodegeneration. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction that may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD via decreased clearance of AÎ². 
24894631	The FAM3 superfamily member ILEI ameliorates Alzheimer's disease-like pathology by destabilizing the penultimate amyloid-Î² precursor.
Nat Commun 20140604 2014
Accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) in the brain underlies the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AÎ² is produced by Î²- and Î³-secretase-mediated sequential proteolysis of amyloid-Î² precursor protein (APP). Here we identify a secretory protein named interleukin-like epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducer (ILEI, also known as FAM3 superfamily member C) as a negative regulator of AÎ² production. ILEI destabilizes the Î²-secretase-cleaved APP carboxy-terminal fragment, the penultimate precursor of AÎ², by binding to the Î³-secretase complex and interfering with its chaperone properties. Notch signalling and Î³-secretase activity are not affected by ILEI. We also show neuronal expression of ILEI and its induction by transforming growth factor-Î² signalling. The level of secreted ILEI is markedly decreased in the brains of AD patients. Transgenic (Tg) overexpression of ILEI significantly reduces the brain AÎ² burden and ameliorates the memory deficit in AD model mice. ILEI may be a plausible target for the development of disease-modifying therapies.  
24902845	Identification of longitudinally dynamic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid by targeted proteomics.
Mol Neurodegener 20140606 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia affecting greater than 26 million people worldwide. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of AÎ²42, tau, and p-tau181 are well established as diagnostic biomarkers of AD, there is a need for additional CSF biomarkers of neuronal function that continue to change during disease progression and could be used as pharmacodynamic measures in clinical trials. Multiple proteomic discovery experiments have reported a range of CSF biomarkers that differ between AD and control subjects. These potential biomarkers represent multiple aspects of the disease pathology. The performance of these markers has not been compared with each other, and their performance has not been evaluated longitudinally. We developed a targeted-proteomic, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay for the absolute quantitation of 39 peptides corresponding to 30 proteins. We evaluated the candidate biomarkers in longitudinal CSF samples collected from aged, cognitively-normal control (nâ€‰=â€‰10), MCI (nâ€‰=â€‰5), and AD (nâ€‰=â€‰45) individuals (ageâ€‰&gt;â€‰60Â years). We evaluated each biomarker for diagnostic sensitivity, longitudinal consistency, and compared with CSF AÎ²42, tau, and p-tau181. Four of 28 quantifiable CSF proteins were significantly different between aged, cognitively-normal controls and AD subjects including chitinase-3-like protein 1, reproducing published results. Four CSF markers demonstrated significant longitudinal change in AD: Amyloid precursor protein, Neuronal pentraxin receptor, NrCAM and Chromogranin A. Robust correlations were observed within some subgroups of proteins including the potential disease progression markers. Using a targeted proteomics approach, we confirmed previous findings for a subset of markers, defined longitudinal performance of our panel of markers, and established a flexible proteomics method for robust multiplexed analyses. 
24902695	Ryanodine receptors: physiological function and deregulation in Alzheimer disease.
Mol Neurodegener 20140605 2014
Perturbed Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis emerges as a central player in Alzheimer disease (AD). Accordingly, different studies have reported alterations of the expression and the function of Ryanodine Receptors (RyR) in human AD-affected brains, in cells expressing familial AD-linked mutations on the Î² amyloid precursor protein (Î²APP) and presenilins (the catalytic core in Î³-secretase complexes cleaving the Î²APP, thereby generating amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptides), as well as in the brain of various transgenic AD mice models. Data converge to suggest that RyR expression and function alteration are associated to AD pathogenesis through the control of: i) Î²APP processing and AÎ² peptide production, ii) neuronal death; iii) synaptic function; and iv) memory and learning abilities. In this review, we document the network of evidences suggesting that RyR could play a complex dual "compensatory/protective versus pathogenic" role contributing to the setting of histopathological lesions and synaptic deficits that are associated with the disease stages. We also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying RyR expression and function alterations in AD. Finally, we review recent publications showing that drug-targeting blockade of RyR and genetic manipulation of RyR reduces AÎ² production, stabilizes synaptic transmission, and prevents learning and memory deficits in various AD mouse models. Chemically-designed RyR "modulators" could therefore be envisioned as new therapeutic compounds able to delay or block the progression of AD.  
24915960	The expression of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) is associated with aging-related cell death in the cortex but not in the hippocampus in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
BMC Neurosci 20140610 2014
Recent evidence has suggested that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated neuronal loss may occur via the caspase-independent route of programmed cell death (PCD) in addition to caspase-dependent mechanisms. However, the brain region specificity of caspase-independent PCD in AD-associated neurodegeneration is unknown. We therefore used the transgenic CRND8 (TgCRND8) AD mouse model to explore whether the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), a key mediator of caspase-independent PCD, contributes to cell loss in selected brain regions in the course of aging. Increased expression of truncated AIF (tAIF), which is directly responsible for cell death induction, was observed at both 4- and 6-months of age in the cortex. Concomitant with the up-regulation of tAIF was an increase in the nuclear translocation of this protein. Heightened tAIF expression or translocation was not observed in the hippocampus or cerebellum, which were used as AD-vulnerable and relatively AD-spared regions, respectively. The cortical alterations in tAIF levels were accompanied by increased Bax expression and mitochondrial translocation. This effect was preceded by a significant reduction in ATP content and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, detectable at 2Â months of age despite negligible amounts of amyloid-beta peptides (AÎ²). Taken together, these data suggest that AIF is likely to play a region-specific role in AD-related caspase-independent PCD, which is consistent with aging-associated mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress. 
25002849	Nutraceuticals in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Front Pharmacol 20140623 2014
Several chemical substances belonging to classes of natural dietary origin display protective properties against some age-related diseases including neurodegenerative ones, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). These compounds, known as nutraceuticals, differ structurally, act therefore at different biochemical and metabolic levels and have shown different types of neuroprotective properties. The aim of this review is to summarize data from observational studies, clinical trials, and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in humans on the effects of selected nutraceuticals against age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. We report results from studies on flavonoids, some vitamins and other natural substances that have been studied in AD and that might be beneficial for the maintenance of a good cognitive performance. Due to the substantial lack of high-level evidence studies there is no possibility for recommendation of nutraceuticals in dementia-related therapeutic guidelines. Nevertheless, the strong potential for their neuroprotective action warrants further studies in the field.  
23199140	The GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 in a case with discordant clinical and FDG-PET findings: PET trumps syndrome.
Neurocase 20121130 2014
A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene was recently discovered as the cause underlying frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) linked to chromosome 9 (c9FTD/ALS). In this atypical case of c9FTD/ALS, the proband presented with amnestic mild cognitive impairment which evolved into Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia and later developed ALS. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography of the brain demonstrated mild hypometabolism involving the medial frontal and lateral temporal lobes, left more so than right, which progressed over time. He was subsequently confirmed to have the C9ORF72 expansion. This report highlights the need to consider mutations in the FTD-associated genes when a familial disorder is suggested and neuroimaging studies reveal findings atypical of an AD pathophysiological process despite the typical anterograde amnestic syndrome.  
24135083	A review of neuroimaging findings of apathy in Alzheimer's disease.
Int Psychogeriatr 20131018 2014Feb
Apathy is one of the most frequent "behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms of dementia" (BPSD) encountered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a growing interest in the early diagnosis of apathetic elderly patients in the community since apathy has been associated with reduced daily functioning, caregiver distress, and poor outcome. The generalization of neuroimaging techniques might be able to offer help in this domain. Within this context we conducted an extensive electronic search from the databases included in the National Library of Medicine as well as PsychInfo and Google Scholar for neuroimaging findings of apathy in AD. Neuroimaging findings lend support to the notion that frontal-subcortical networks are involved in the occurrence of apathy in AD. Longitudinal studies comparing patients and normal individuals might allow us to infer on the association between apathy and neurodegenerative diseases and what can brain imaging markers tell us about the characterization of this association, thus revealing disease patterns, helping to distinguish clinically distinct cognitive syndromes, and allowing predictions. 
24521694	The "Alzheimer's type" profile of semantic clustering in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
J Int Neuropsychol Soc 20140213 2014Apr
Impairments in learning and recall have been well established in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, a relative dearth of studies has examined the profiles of memory strategy use in persons with aMCI relative to those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants with aMCI, nonamnestic MCI, AD, and healthy older adults were administered the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II). Measures of semantic clustering and recall were obtained across learning and delayed recall trials. In addition, we investigated whether deficits in semantic clustering were related to progression from healthy aging to aMCI and from aMCI to AD. The aMCI group displayed similar semantic clustering performance as the AD participants, whereas the AD group showed greater impairments on recall relative to the aMCI participants. Control participants who progressed to aMCI showed reduced semantic clustering at the short delay at baseline compared to individuals who remained diagnostically stable across follow-up visits. These findings show that the ability to engage in an effective memory strategy is compromised in aMCI, before AD has developed, suggesting that disruptions in semantic networks are an early marker of the disease. (JINS, 2014, 20, 1-11).  
24548124	Metacognition in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychology 20140217 2014May
Impaired self-awareness is characteristic of nearly all dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the deficit is most severe in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The prominence of frontal pathology in bvFTD suggests that failure of online monitoring, the process by which individuals monitor their own cognitive processing in real time, is an important contributor. Metacognitive research offers several approaches to measure self-assessment, some more and others less sensitive to online monitoring. The goal of this study was to assess metacognition in bvFTD using several approaches, and to compare the results with those in AD. We examined metacognition in 12 patients with bvFTD, 14 with AD, and 35 healthy controls using feeling of knowing (FOK), ease of learning (EOL), judgment of learning (JOL), and retrospective confidence rating (CR) tasks, as well as response to feedback about performance. BvFTD and AD were both impaired at FOK compared with controls, although AD showed some sparing. Both groups were similarly impaired at CR and neither group was impaired at JOL after accounting for memory performance. Most striking, bvFTD patients failed to appropriately adjust their predictions about future memory performance even after receiving explicit feedback that they had performed worse than they expected. Both bvFTD and AD show deficits in online monitoring, although the deficit appears more severe in bvFTD. The insensitivity of bvFTD patients to overt feedback may point to unique mechanisms, possibly frontally mediated, that add to their severe lack of self-awareness. 
24738476	New melatonin-N,N-dibenzyl(N-methyl)amine hybrids: potent neurogenic agents with antioxidant, cholinergic, and neuroprotective properties as innovative drugs for Alzheimer's disease.
J. Med. Chem. 20140428 2014May8
Here, we describe a new family of melatonin-N,N-dibenzyl(N-methyl)amine hybrids that show a balanced multifunctional profile covering neurogenic, antioxidant, cholinergic, and neuroprotective properties at low-micromolar concentrations. They promote maturation of neural stem cells into a neuronal phenotype and thus they could contribute to CNS repair. They also protect neural cells against mitochondrial oxidative stress, show antioxidant properties, and inhibit human acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Moreover, they displace propidium from the peripheral anionic site of AChE, preventing the Î²-amyloid aggregation promoted by AChE. In addition, they show low cell toxicity and can penetrate into the CNS. This multifunctional profile highlights these melatonin-N,N-dibenzyl(N-methyl)amine hybrids as useful prototypes in the research of innovative drugs for Alzheimer's disease.  
24828629	Î±-Melanocyte stimulating hormone prevents GABAergic neuronal loss and improves cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurosci.  2014May14
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), appropriate excitatory-inhibitory balance required for memory formation is impaired. Our objective was to elucidate deficits in the inhibitory GABAergic system in the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD to establish a link between GABAergic dysfunction and cognitive function. We sought to determine whether the neuroprotective peptide Î±-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH) attenuates GABAergic loss and thus improves cognition. TgCRND8 mice with established Î²-amyloid peptide pathology and nontransgenic littermates were treated with either Î±-MSH or vehicle via daily intraperitoneal injections for 28 d. TgCRND8 mice exhibited spatial memory deficits and altered anxiety that were rescued after Î±-MSH treatment. The expression of GABAergic marker glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and the number of GABAergic GAD67+ interneurons expressing neuropeptide Y and somatostatin are reduced in the hippocampus in vehicle-treated TgCRND8 mice. In the septohippocampal pathway, GABAergic deficits are observed before cholinergic deficits, suggesting that GABAergic loss may underlie behavior deficits in vehicle-treated TgCRND8 mice. Î±-MSH preserves GAD67 expression and prevents loss of the somatostatin-expressing subtype of GABAergic GAD67+ inhibitory interneurons. Without decreasing Î²-amyloid peptide load in the brain, Î±-MSH improves spatial memory in TgCRND8 mice and prevents alterations in anxiety. Î±-MSH modulated the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain by restoring GABAergic inhibition and, as a result, improved cognition in TgCRND8 mice.  
24828645	Suppression of InsP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling alleviates mutant presenilin-linked familial Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
J. Neurosci.  2014May14
Exaggerated intracellular Ca(2+) signaling is a robust proximal phenotype observed in cells expressing familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-causing mutant presenilins (PSs). The mechanisms that underlie this phenotype are controversial and their in vivo relevance for AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we used a genetic approach to identify the mechanisms involved and to evaluate their role in the etiology of AD in two FAD mouse models. Genetic reduction of the type 1 inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R1) by 50% normalized exaggerated Ca(2+) signaling observed in cortical and hippocampal neurons in both animal models. In PS1M146V knock-in mice, reduced InsP3R1 expression restored normal ryanodine receptor and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent gene expression and rescued aberrant hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In 3xTg mice, reduced InsP3R1 expression profoundly attenuated amyloid Î² accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation and rescued hippocampal LTP and memory deficits. These results indicate that exaggerated Ca(2+) signaling, which is associated with FAD PS, is mediated by InsP3R and contributes to disease pathogenesis in vivo. Targeting the InsP3 signaling pathway could be considered a potential therapeutic strategy for patients harboring mutations in PS linked to AD.  
24828655	Activation of neurotensin receptor 1 facilitates neuronal excitability and spatial learning and memory in the entorhinal cortex: beneficial actions in an Alzheimer's disease model.
J. Neurosci.  2014May14
Neurotensin (NT) is a tridecapeptide distributed in the CNS, including the entorhinal cortex (EC), a structure that is crucial for learning and memory and undergoes the earliest pathological alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whereas NT has been implicated in modulating cognition, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which NT modifies cognitive processes and the potential therapeutic roles of NT in AD have not been determined. Here we examined the effects of NT on neuronal excitability and spatial learning in the EC, which expresses high density of NT receptors. Brief application of NT induced persistent increases in action potential firing frequency, which could last for at least 1 h. NT-induced facilitation of neuronal excitability was mediated by downregulation of TREK-2 K(+) channels and required the functions of NTS1, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C. Microinjection of NT or NTS1 agonist, PD149163, into the EC increased spatial learning as assessed by the Barnes Maze Test. Activation of NTS1 receptors also induced persistent increases in action potential firing frequency and significantly improved the memory status in APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of AD. Our study identifies a cellular substrate underlying learning and memory and suggests that NTS1 agonists may exert beneficial actions in an animal model of AD.  
24517464	Insights into the physiological function of the Î²-amyloid precursor protein: beyond Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurochem. 20140307 2014Jun
The Î²-amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied for its role as the precursor of the Î²-amyloid protein (AÎ²) of Alzheimer's disease. However, the normal function of APP remains largely unknown. This article reviews studies on the structure, expression and post-translational processing of APP, as well as studies on the effects of APP in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the published data provide strong evidence that APP has a trophic function. APP is likely to be involved in neural stem cell development, neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth and neurorepair. However, the mechanisms by which APP exerts its actions remain to be elucidated. The available evidence suggests that APP interacts both intracellularly and extracellularly to regulate various signal transduction mechanisms.

24748672	Long-term effects of amyloid, hypometabolism, and atrophy on neuropsychological functions.
Neurology 20140418 2014May20
To assess how amyloid deposition, glucose hypometabolism, and cerebral atrophy affect neuropsychological performance in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls over time. A total of 41 patients with AD dementia, 28 patients with MCI, and 19 controls underwent [(11)C]-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) and [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG)-PET and MRI scans at baseline. We extracted global binding potential for (11)C-PiB, the number of abnormal voxels for (18)F-FDG, and gray matter volumes using SIENAX for MRI as measures of amyloid, hypometabolism, and atrophy. In addition, repeat neuropsychological testing was performed, including memory, attention, language, and executive tasks (mean follow-up 2.2 Â± 0.7 years). Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between imaging markers and cognition were assessed using linear mixed models, including terms for the imaging markers, time, sex, age, diagnosis, and interactions for imaging marker Ã— time and imaging marker Ã— time Ã— diagnosis. Linear mixed models showed that baseline hypometabolism and atrophy were associated with poorer baseline performance on attention and executive functions (p &lt; 0.05), whereas amyloid was not related to baseline cognition. Hypometabolism and amyloid were strongly associated with longitudinal decline in essentially all cognitive domains (pinteraction &lt; 0.05), whereas atrophy was related specifically to future decline in Mini-Mental State Examination and memory (pinteraction &lt; 0.05). Glucose hypometabolism and brain atrophy were associated with concurrent cognitive function, whereas brain amyloid was not. Amyloid deposition and glucose hypometabolism were predictors for decline of a wide variety of cognitive functions, while brain atrophy specifically predicted memory deterioration. 
24883305	The role of Wnt signaling in the development of Alzheimer's disease: a potential therapeutic target?
Biomed Res Int 20140504 2014
Accumulating evidence supports a key role for Wnt signaling in the development of the central nervous system (CNS) during embryonic development and in the regulation of the structure and function of the adult brain. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia, which is characterized by Î² -amyloid (A Î² ) deposition in specific brain regions. However, the molecular mechanism underlying AD pathology remains elusive. Dysfunctional Wnt signaling is associated with several diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, metabolic disease, and AD. Increasing evidence suggests that downregulation of Wnt signaling, induced by A Î² , is associated with disease progression of AD. More importantly, persistent activation of Wnt signaling through Wnt ligands, or inhibition of negative regulators of Wnt signaling, such as Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 Î² (GSK-3 Î² ) that are hyperactive in the disease state, is able to protect against A Î² toxicity and ameliorate cognitive performance in AD. Together, these data suggest that Wnt signaling might be a potential therapeutic target of AD. Here, we review recent studies related to the progression of AD where Wnt signaling might be relevant and participate in the development of the disease. Then, we focus on the potential relevance of manipulating the Wnt signaling pathway for the treatment of AD.  
24839952	Role of cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care  2014Jul
Cholesterol has been shown to stimulate the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid peptides involved in Alzheimer's disease. However, high level of peripheral cholesterol as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is still debated. This current review provides an update of the recent literature on cholesterol and APP metabolisms in the brain. First, a new relationship between neuronal APP and cholesterol has been shown in which this protein controls cholesterol turnover required for neuronal activity. Second, oxysterols are able to stimulate the synthesis of ATP-binding cassette transporters involved in the exchange of amyloid peptides between the blood and the brain. Third, changes in APP targeting to lipid rafts and/or their composition in cholesterol regulate amyloid peptide production. These recent findings open new areas of investigations to control the neuronal activity and to decrease the amyloid peptide levels in brain, opening on new preventive and therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease. 
24886239	Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 knockout reduces cognitive impairment and pathogenesis in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol Brain 20140529 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology occurs in part as the result of excessive production of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²). Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is now considered a receptor for AÎ² and consequently contributes to pathogenic AÎ² signaling in AD. Genetic deletion of mGluR5 rescues the spatial learning deficits observed in APPswe/PS1Î”E9 AD mice. Moreover, both AÎ² oligomer formation and AÎ² plaque number are reduced in APPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice lacking mGluR5 expression. In addition to the observed increase in AÎ² oligomers and plaques in APPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice, we found that both mTOR phosphorylation and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression were increased in these mice. Genetic deletion of mGluR5 reduced AÎ² oligomers, plaques, mTOR phosphorylation and FMRP expression in APPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice. Thus, we propose that AÎ² activation of mGluR5 appears to initiate a positive feedback loop resulting in increased AÎ² formation and AD pathology in APPswe/PS1Î”E9 mice via mechanism that is regulated by FMRP. 
24934556	Health care resource utilisation in primary care prior to and after a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: a retrospective, matched case-control study in the United Kingdom.
BMC Geriatr 20140617 2014
This study examined medical resource utilisation patterns in the United Kingdom (UK) prior to and following Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. A patient cohort aged 65 years and older with newly diagnosed AD between January 2008 and December 2010 was identified through the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Patients with a continuous record in the CPRD (formerly the General Practice Research Database [GPRD]) for both the 3 years prior to, and the 1 year following, AD diagnosis were eligible for inclusion. A control cohort was identified by matching general older adult (GOA) patients to patients with AD based on year of birth, gender, region, and Charlson Comorbidity Index at a ratio of 2:1. Medical resource utilisation was calculated in 6-month intervals over the 4-year study period. Comparisons between AD and GOA control cohorts were conducted using conditional logistic regression for patient characteristics and a generalised linear model for resource utilisation. Data for the AD cohort (Nâ€‰=â€‰3,896) and matched GOA control cohort (Nâ€‰=â€‰7,792) were extracted from the CPRD. The groups were 65% female and the AD cohort had a mean age of 79.9 years (standard deviation 6.5 years) at the date of diagnosis. Over the entire study period, the AD cohort had a significantly higher mean primary care consultation rate than the GOA cohort (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.0001). While the GOA cohort primary care consultation rate gradually increased over the 4-year period (ranging from 5 to 7 consultations per 6-month period), increases were more pronounced in the AD cohort (ranging from 6 to 11 consultations per 6-month period, peaking during the 6-month periods immediately prior to and post diagnosis). The AD cohort also had a higher overall specialty referral rate than the GOA cohort over the 4-year period (37% vs. 25%, respectively; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.0001); the largest difference was during the 6 months immediately prior to AD diagnosis (17% vs. 5%, respectively; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.0001). In the UK, AD diagnosis is associated with significant increases in primary and secondary care resource utilisation, continuing beyond diagnosis. This evidence may be important to health care commissioners to facilitate effective mobilisation of appropriate AD-related health care resources.

25009335	Autoantibodies in Alzheimer disease;.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr.  2014Aug
There is increasing evidence to support the relevance of immune system in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer Disease (AD) and also there is growing evidence for importance of specific antibodies in some neurological disorders. Antibodies against Voltage Gated Potassium Channels (VGKC) and Glutamic Decarboxylase (GAD) are of interest for AD. The presence of these antibodies is thought to be related to cognitive impairment and memory problems. In our study we attempted to find a relationship between these antibodies in individuals with AD compared with healthy controls. Twenty two patients with diagnosis of mild to moderate AD aged 65 and above were recruited from a memory clinic. Controls (22) were partners/carers of recruited patients who had no complaints of memory impairment and had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) of 29 and above. Antibodies were measured by radioimmuo-precipitaion assay. AD and control group did not differ significantly in age (p=0.593) and gender (0.674) but as expected the median MMSE scores (pâ‰¤0.001) did. We could not find any statistically significant difference between level of VGKC-ab (p=0.490) or GAD (p=0.330) between patients and controls. NMDA antibodies were negative in both groups. One of the patients (84 year old, female, MMSE 20/30 none smoker with no medical history and only 6 months history of memory decline) had strong positive Hippocampal Neurons (G) antibodies. This was observed on the strong immunocytochemical staining of the hippocampal neurons. It is still unclear for how long these antibodies are being identified in acute onset of many neurological diseases including amnesia or psychosis. We know that pathophysiology of AD starts many years before the clinical presentations. It may be the case that positive antibodies can be found in a very early stage of mild cognitive impairment. 
25009354	The prospects for a vaccine for Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr.  2014Aug
Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology is characterised by abnormal aggregation in the brain of amyloid-Î² (Ab) and hyperphosphorylated tau, associated with inflammation and loss of neurons and synapses. The amyloid cascade hypothesis places abnormal aggregation of Ab at an early point in the pathogenesis of the disease, upstream of tau aggregation, although how Ab and tau interact in disease pathogenesis is unclear. In numerous studies of transgenic mouse models of AD, Ab immunisation has resulted in Ab plaque removal with functional benefits. We have performed a long term clinical and neuropathological follow up of patients with AD who were actively immunised with AÎ²42 (Elan Pharmaceuticals). A total of 80 patients were enrolled in the study which started in the year 2000:64 received AÎ²42 peptide plus adjuvant and 16 received adjuvant alone. Post mortem neuropathology has identified substantial changes in the AD process in immunised patients including a lower AÎ² load and a reduction in hyperphosphorylated tau, particularly in neuronal processes. In addition pathological "side-effects" were also observed, including: (i) altered microglial activation (ii) increased AÎ² in the cerebral vasculature (cerebral amyloid angiopathy) and (iii) increased microhaemorrhages. In demonstrating that Ab immunisation can influence tau pathology, the findings provide support for the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, the pathological "side effects" identified may be relevant to current immunotherapy trials, indicating that at least in a proportion of patients removing amyloid from the brain may have complications that need to be surmounted, for example by earlier intervention or use of immunotherapy as a preventative measure.  
25009356	Trem2 variants increase risk of typical early-onset Alzheimer's disease but not of prion or frontotemporal dementia.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr.  2014Aug
Variants in TREM2, a gene expressed on microglia and involved in CNS innate immunity, have recently been reported as rare but strong risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Microglial mediated inflammation is implicated in several dementias. It remains unresolved whether TREM2 variant effects are selective for Alzheimer's disease or generic to neurodegeneration, and whether there is a distinct clinical phenotype associated. This study sought to provide the first systematic characterisation and detailed clinical phenotyping of TREM2 associated neurodegeneration across multiple dementias. We used next generation sequencing of the entire coding sequence (n=700), targeted Sanger sequencing of exon 2 (n=2634), p.R47H genotyping (n=3518) and imputation from genome wide association study data (n=3383) to determine TREM2 variants in large independent cohorts of patients with clinical diagnoses of predominantly early-onset Alzheimer's disease (n=1002), frontotemporal dementia (n=358), sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n=2437) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n=115). We describe the demographics, disease duration, neuroimaging, neuropsychological profiles and pathological findings in Alzheimer's disease cases with p.R47H and perform a case-control study comparing the detailed clinical presentations, rates of mini mental state examination decline and volumetric neuroimaging characteristics. We confirm previous reports that p.R47H is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease vs. unselected controls (OR=2.19; 95% CI=1.04-4.51; P=0.03) and show that it does not significantly alter the risk for frontotemporal dementia (OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.09-3.36, P=1.00), sporadic or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (ORs=0.97-1.54 in three populations). We found a total of 49 non-synonymous alleles in 47 Alzheimer's patients, including one homozygous p.R47H case. Where age of symptom onset was available, Alzheimer's disease individuals with p.R47H TREM2 variants (n=12) were significantly younger at symptom onset than individuals with no TREM2 variants (n=551) (p.R47H: 55.2 years vs nil TREM2 variants: 61.7 years, P=0.024). 10/12 (83%) of the p.R47H Alzheimer's disease cases had age-at-onset below 65 years, and 4/12 below 50 years. Heterozygous p.R47H Alzheimer's disease typically had a memory led presentation with disease duration, rates of mini mental state examination decline, and neuroimaging and pathological features indistinguishable from 'typical' sporadic Alzheimer's. The one notable exception was the homozygous p.R47H individual who had a behavioural presentation. Despite having typical Alzheimer's disease pathology confirmed on histology, they had an unusual degree of frontal atrophy, and relative sparing of the hippocampi. Heterozygous p.R47H variants confer specific risk for Alzheimer's disease, and result in earlier symptom onset in a disease that appears otherwise typical for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. 
24378418	Associations between serum cholesterol levels and cerebral amyloidosis.
JAMA Neurol  2014Feb
Because deposition of cerebral Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) seems to be a key initiating event in Alzheimer disease (AD), factors associated with increased deposition are of great interest. Whether elevated serum cholesterol levels act as such a factor is unknown. To investigate the association between serum cholesterol levels and cerebral AÎ² during life early in the AD process. A multisite, university medical center-based, cross-sectional analysis of potential associations between contemporaneously assayed total serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and cerebral AÎ², measured with carbon C11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography. Seventy-four persons (mean age, 78 years) were recruited via direct outreach in stroke clinics and community senior facilities following a protocol designed to obtain a cohort enriched for cerebrovascular disease and elevated vascular risk. Three patients had mild dementia. All others were clinically normal (n = 33) or had mild cognitive impairment (n = 38). Cerebral AÎ² was quantified using a Global PIB Index, which averages PIB retention in cortical areas prone to amyloidosis. Statistical models that controlled for age and the apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele revealed independent associations among the levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, and PIB index. Higher LDL-C and lower HDL-C levels were both associated with a higher PIB index. No association was found between the total cholesterol level and PIB index. No association was found between statin use and PIB index, and controlling for cholesterol treatment in the statistical models did not alter the basic findings. Elevated cerebral AÎ² level was associated with cholesterol fractions in a pattern analogous to that found in coronary artery disease. This finding, in living humans, is consistent with prior autopsy reports, epidemiologic findings, and animal and in vitro work, suggesting an important role for cholesterol in AÎ² processing. Because cholesterol levels are modifiable, understanding their link to AÎ² deposition could potentially and eventually have an effect on retarding the pathologic cascade of AD. These findings suggest that understanding the mechanisms through which serum lipids modulate AÎ² could offer new approaches to slowing AÎ² deposition and thus to reducing the incidence of AD. 
23883541	Vitamin D supplementation restores suppressed synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease.
Nutr Neurosci 20131126 2014Jul
Hippocampus, an appropriate area of brain for assessment of long-term potentiation (LTP), has been found to be susceptible to neural damages caused by Alzheimer's disease. Evidence indicates that vitamin D supports nerve transmission and synaptic plasticity. Vitamin D receptors are expressed in the hippocampus. The present study evaluates occurrence of LTP in the control (CON) group fed with normal regimen and, three groups of AÎ²-treated rats taking normal (ALZ), vitamin D-free (ALZ - D), or 1,25(OH)2D3 supplemented (ALZ + D) food regimens. In in vivo experiments pre- and post-tetanus field extracellular postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the CA3-CA1 pathway. We found that the amplitude of baseline fEPSPs was significantly lower in the ALZ group compared with the CON one; lack of vitamin D further declined the amplitude of responses in the ALZ - D animals. While the tetanic stimulation elicited a considerable LTP in the CON rats it was failed to induce LTP in the ALZ animals. Furthermore, the tetanus considerably depressed the amplitude of recordings in the ALZ - D group. 1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation restored post-tetanus potentiation of fEPSPs amplitude in the ALZ + D groups. The present findings signify the crucial role of vitamin D on the basic synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. 
24718102	Proteins recruited to exosomes by tau overexpression implicate novel cellular mechanisms linking tau secretion with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Tau misprocessing to form aggregates and other toxic species has emerged as a major feature in our developing understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The significance of tau misprocessing in AD has been further emphasized by recent studies showing that tau can be secreted from neurons via exosomes and may itself be an important agent in the spreading of neurofibrillary lesions within the brain. Tau secretion occurs most readily under disease-associated conditions in cellular models, suggesting that cellular changes responsible for secretion, possibly including tau oligomerization, could play a key role in the propagation of neurofibrillary lesions in neurodegenerative disease. Here we show that overexpression of 4R0N human tau in neuroblastoma cells recruits mitochondrial and axonogenesis-associated proteins relevant to neurodegeneration into the exosomal secretion pathway via distinct mechanisms. The recruitment of mitochondrial proteins appears to be linked to autophagy disruption (exophagy) in multiple neurodegenerative conditions but has few known direct links to AD and tau. By contrast, the involvement of synaptic plasticity and axonogenesis markers is highly specific to both tau and AD and may be relevant to the reactivation of developmental programs involving tau in AD and the recently demonstrated ability of secreted tau to establish tissue distribution gradients in CNS neuropil. We also found a highly significant correlation between genes that are significantly downregulated in multiple forms of AD and proteins that have been recruited to exosomes by tau, which we interpret as strong evidence for the central involvement of tau secretion in AD cytopathogenesis. Our results suggest that multiple cellular mechanisms may link tau secretion to both toxicity and neurofibrillary lesion spreading in AD and other tauopathies.  
24418360	Brain sex matters: estrogen in cognition and Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 20140111 2014May25
Estrogens are the primary female sex hormones and play important roles in both reproductive and non-reproductive systems. Estrogens can be synthesized in non-reproductive tissues such as liver, heart, muscle, bone and the brain. During the past decade, increasing evidence suggests that brain estrogen can not only be synthesized by neurons, but also by astrocytes. Brain estrogen also works locally at the site of synthesis in paracrine and/or intracrine fashion to maintain important tissue-specific functions. Here, we will focus on the biology of brain estrogen and its impact on cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease. This comprehensive review provides new insights into brain estrogens by presenting a better understanding of the tissue-specific estrogen effects and their roles in healthy ageing and cognitive function.  
24890471	Saccade deficits in amnestic mild cognitive impairment resemble mild Alzheimer's disease.
Eur. J. Neurosci.  2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disorder of progressive memory loss and executive dysfunction. Little is known about the progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; isolated memory loss) to AD. Studies have found impairments in mild-stage AD and aMCI in specific tests of executive function. Here, we used objective saccade tasks to determine if they can effectively assess executive function deficits otherwise assessed by neuropsychological testing. To determine which executive function deficits the saccade tasks are most sensitive to, we also investigated the relationship between performance on saccade tasks and neuropsychological test scores. Twenty-two aMCI patients (63-90Â years), 24 mild AD patients (61-87Â years) and 76 healthy controls (60-85Â years) performed a battery of neuropsychological tests, and two saccade tasks designed to probe sensory, motor and cognitive function. The prosaccade task requires a fast, automatic saccade toward an eccentric visual stimulus. The antisaccade task requires additional executive processing to inhibit the automatic prosaccade toward the stimulus, so that a voluntary saccade can be initiated to a location opposite the stimulus. Antisaccade performance was impaired similarly in aMCI and AD patients relative to controls; both groups were slower to initiate correct antisaccades and they made more direction errors (erroneous prosaccades), suggesting similar brain deficits. Scores on the Stroop task were inversely correlated with the percentage of short-latency direction errors in the antisaccade task for controls and aMCI patients, whereas other more global measures of executive function were not related to saccade measures in any subject group. Our results show that the antisaccade task is useful for detecting executive dysfunction in aMCI and AD, especially dysfunction in selective attention. Saccade tasks may therefore have potential to assess executive dysfunction when use of neuropsychological tests is not possible.  
24444253	Down-regulation of MET in hippocampal neurons of Alzheimer's disease brains.
Neuropathology 20140121 2014Jun
We found that mRNA of MET, the receptor of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), is significantly decreased in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Therefore, we tried to determine the cellular component-dependent changes of MET expressions. In this study, we examined cellular distribution of MET in the cerebral neocortices and hippocampi of 12 AD and 11 normal controls without brain diseases. In normal brains, MET immunoreactivity was observed in the neuronal perikarya and a subpopulation of astrocytes mainly in the subpial layer and white matter. In AD brains, we found marked decline of MET in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and granule cells of dentate gyrus. The decline was more obvious in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampi than that in the neocortical neurons. In addition, we found strong MET immunostaining in reactive astrocytes, including those near senile plaques. Given the neurotrophic effects of the HGF/MET pathway, this decline may adversely affect neuronal survival in AD cases. Because it has been reported that HGF is also up-regulated around senile plaques, Î²-amyloid deposition might be associated with astrocytosis through the HGF signaling pathway.  
24485508	Migration of neutrophils targeting amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140108 2014Jun
Immune responses in the brain are thought to play a role in disorders of the central nervous system, but an understanding of the process underlying how immune cells get into the brain and their fate there remains unclear. In this study, we used a 2-photon microscopy to reveal that neutrophils infiltrate brain and migrate toward amyloid plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest a new molecular process underlying the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.  
24784008	Strategy selection in Alzheimer patients: a study in arithmetic.
J Clin Exp Neuropsychol 20140501 2014
We compared Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' and elderly controls' abilities to select the best strategy on each item and determined whether AD patients tended to repeat the same strategy across consecutive items more often than controls. A total of 60 participants (30 healthy older adults, HOA; 30 AD patients) were asked to select the best rounding strategy to estimate products of multiplication problems (e.g., estimating 42 Ã— 76 by rounding operands down or up, like doing 40 Ã— 70 = 2800 or 50 Ã— 80 = 3200). We identified strategies used on each problem and measured solution latencies and percentage errors with each strategy as a function of problem characteristics. Older adults and AD patients were able to use both available strategies. However, AD patients were less able to select the best strategy than HOA, especially on problems for which selecting the best strategy was most difficult. Moreover, AD patients significantly repeated the preceding strategies across successive problems more often than HOA. Our findings have important implications for further our understanding of dementia-related differences in strategic aspects of cognitive performance. 
24473279	Combination of metabolomic and phospholipid-profiling approaches for the study of Alzheimer's disease.
J Proteomics 20140125 2014Jun2
Alzheimer's disease is closely related to abnormal metabolism of phospholipids from neural membranes, so that the study of their dyshomeostasis could be of great interest for the discovery of potential biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. In this work, it has been developed a metabolomic multi-platform for the characterization of phospholipid alterations occurring in serum from Alzheimer's disease patients. For this purpose, we performed a metabolomic screening by direct infusion mass spectrometry and profiling analysis by reversed phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with complementary detection by molecular and atomic mass spectrometry, which allowed combining the high-throughput capability of shotgun metabolomics and the targeted character of profiling approaches. Thus significant changes were detected in the levels of several molecular species of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, plasmenylcholines, plasmenylethanolamines and different classes of lysophospholipids, which provided a global vision of the possible factors triggering membrane breakdown. In this sense, alterations of phospholipids metabolism appears to have a multifactorial origin involving overactivation of phospholipases, increased anabolism of lysophospholipids, peroxisomal dysfunction, imbalances in the levels of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids contained in the structure of phospholipids and oxidative stress. This work represents the first comprehensive characterization of serum phospholipids alterations in relation to Alzheimer's disease, by combining shotgun metabolomics and phospholipids profiling through different analytical approaches.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Environmental and structural proteomics. 
24131448	Oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease: are we connecting the dots?
J. Med. Chem. 20131105 2014Apr10
Redox impairment is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has led to the "oxidative stress hypothesis", which proposes antioxidants as beneficial therapeutic tools in AD treatment. To date, a wide variety of antioxidants have been examined as neuroprotectants. However, success has been elusive in clinical trials. Several factors have contributed to this failure, including the complexity of the redox system in vivo. Potentially critical aspects include the fine-tuned equilibrium between antioxidant defenses and free radical production, the lack of specific antioxidant target(s), and the inherent difficulty in delivering antioxidants where they are needed. Herein, we highlight significant progress in the field. Future directions of antioxidant research are also presented.  
24987466	A coimmunization vaccine of AÎ²42 ameliorates cognitive deficits without brain inflammation in an Alzheimer's disease model.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140512 2014
Vaccination against amyloid-Î² protein (AÎ²42) induces high levels of antibody, making it a promising strategy for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). One drawback in the past was that clinical trial approval was withheld because of speculation that the AÎ²42 vaccine induces CD4(+) T cell infiltrations into the central nervous system. To reduce T-cell activation while concomitantly maintaining high anti-AÎ²42 titers is a great challenge in immunology. We aimed to demonstrate that coimmunization with AÎ²42 protein and expression plasmid can be beneficial in a mouse AD model and can prevent inflammation. We immunized the AD mice with the coimmunization vaccine and assessed behavior change and AÎ²42 deposition. Furthermore, to determine the safety of the coimmunization vaccine, we used an induced AÎ²42-EAE model to mimic the meningoencephalitis that happened in the AN-1792 vaccine clinical phase II trial and tested whether the coimmunization vaccine could ameliorate T-cell-mediated brain inflammation. The coimmunization vaccination reduced AÎ² plaques and significantly ameliorated cognitive deficit while inhibiting T-cell-mediated brain inflammation and infiltration. These studies demonstrate that the coimmunization strategy that we describe in this article can ameliorate AD pathology without notable adverse effects in mice. A coimmunization strategy leading to the development of a safe immunotherapeutic/preventive protocol against AD in humans is warranted. 
24987467	The association of angiotensin-converting enzyme with biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140515 2014
Lower angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity could increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as ACE functions to degrade amyloid-Î² (AÎ²). Therefore, we investigated whether ACE protein and activity levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were associated with CSF AÎ², total tau (tau) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau). We included 118 subjects from our memory clinic-based Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (mean age 66â€‰Â±â€‰8Â years) with subjective memory complaints (nâ€‰=â€‰40) or AD (nâ€‰=â€‰78), who did not use antihypertensive drugs. We measured ACE protein levels (ng/ml) and activity (RFU) in CSF and serum, and amyloid Î²1-42, tau and ptau (pg/ml) in CSF. Cross-sectional regression analyses showed that ACE protein level and activity in CSF and serum were lower in patients with AD compared to controls. Lower CSF ACE protein level, and to a lesser extent serum ACE protein level and CSF ACE activity, were associated with lower CSF AÎ², indicating more brain AÎ² pathology; adjusted regression coefficients (B) (95% CI) per SD increase were 0.09 (0.04; 0.15), 0.06 (0.00; 0.12) and 0.05 (0.00; 0.11), respectively. Further, lower CSF ACE protein level was associated with lower CSF tau and ptau levels; adjusted B's (95% CI) per SD increase were 0.15 (0.06; 0.25) and 0.17 (0.10; 0.25), respectively. These results strengthen the hypothesis that ACE degrades AÎ². This could suggest that lowering ACE levels by for example ACE-inhibitors might have adverse consequences for patients with, or at risk for AD. 
24987465	Levels of cerebrospinal fluid Î±-synuclein oligomers are increased in Parkinson's disease with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies compared to Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140507 2014
The objective was to study whether Î±-synuclein oligomers are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with dementia, including Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Alzheimer disease (AD), compared with age-matched controls. In total, 247 CSF samples were assessed in this study, including 71 patients with DLB, 30 patients with PDD, 48 patients with AD, and 98 healthy age-matched controls. Both total and oligomeric Î±-synuclein levels were evaluated by using well-established immunoassays. The levels of Î±-synuclein oligomers in the CSF were increased in patients with PDD compared with the controls (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05), but not in patients with DLB compared with controls. Interestingly, the levels of Î±-synuclein oligomers in the CSF were also significantly higher in patients with PDD (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and DLB (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) compared with patients with AD. The levels of CSF Î±-synuclein oligomers and the ratio of oligomeric/total-Î±-synuclein could distinguish DLB or PDD patients from AD patients, with areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.64 and 0.75, respectively. In addition, total-Î±-synuclein alone could distinguish DLB or PDD patients from AD patients, with an AUC of 0.80. The levels of Î±-synuclein oligomers were increased in the CSF from Î±-synucleinopathy patients with dementia compared with AD cases. 
24987399	Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological tests in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from mild cognitive impairment: can the montreal cognitive assessment be better than the cambridge cognitive examination?
Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra 20140520 2014May
Considering the lack of studies on measures that increase the diagnostic distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and on the role of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) in this, our study aims to compare the utility of the CAMCOG, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in helping to differentiate AD from MCI in elderly people with &gt;4 years of schooling. A total of 136 elderly subjects - 39 normal controls as well as 52 AD patients and 45 MCI patients treated at the Institute of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Porto Alegre, Brazil - were assessed using the MMSE, CAMCOG, clock drawing test (CDT), verbal fluency test (VF), Geriatric Depression Scale and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire. The results obtained by means of a receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the MoCA is a better screening test for differentiating elderly subjects with AD from those with MCI than the CAMCOG and MMSE as well as other tests such as the CDT and VF. The MoCA, more than the CAMCOG and the other tests, was shown to be able to differentiate AD from MCI, although, as Roalf et al. [Alzheimers Dement 2013;9:529-537] pointed out, further studies might lead to measures that will improve this differentiation. 
24987402	The Effects of an Uninterrupted Switch from Donepezil to Galantamine without Dose Titration on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in Alzheimer's Disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra 20140521 2014May
To elucidate the efficacy of galantamine on cognition and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in outpatients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) who have switched from donepezil to galantamine. We performed an uninterrupted switch from donepezil to galantamine without a washout period or dose titration in 44 ambulatory outpatients with amnestic MCI (n = 12) or mild-to-moderate AD (n = 32). Three months after the switch, the efficacy of galantamine was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and NPI Brief Questionnaire Form (NPI-Q), respectively, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. NPI scores improved significantly on BPSD, especially on delusions, agitation and aberrant motor activity in AD patients (p = 0.027); improvement was remarkable in patients with moderate AD (MMSE score 10-19; p = 0.007), while insignificant in those with MCI (MMSE score â‰¥24; p = 0.648). The NPI-Q score also improved significantly regarding both the severity of the disease (p = 0.009) and caregiver distress (p = 0.012) in AD patients. MMSE scores hardly improved in either MCI (p = 0.394) or AD patients (p = 0.265). An uninterrupted switch from donepezil to galantamine could be a useful alternative treatment option for AD patients whose BPSD are unresponsive to donepezil, or whose caregivers are not satisfied with donepezil treatment.

24987334	GABAergic neurotransmission and new strategies of neuromodulation to compensate synaptic dysfunction in early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Cell Neurosci 20140625 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive decline, brain atrophy due to neuronal and synapse loss, and formation of two pathological lesions: extracellular amyloid plaques, composed largely of amyloid-beta peptide (AÎ²), and neurofibrillary tangles formed by intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Lesions mainly accumulate in brain regions that modulate cognitive functions such as the hippocampus, septum or amygdala. These brain structures have dense reciprocal glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic connections and their relationships directly affect learning and memory processes, so they have been proposed as highly susceptible regions to suffer damage by AÎ² during AD course. Last findings support the emerging concept that soluble AÎ² peptides, inducing an initial stage of synaptic dysfunction which probably starts 20-30 years before the clinical onset of AD, can perturb the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuitries. In turn, neurotransmission imbalance will result in altered network activity that might be responsible of cognitive deficits in AD. Therefore, AÎ² interactions on neurotransmission systems in memory-related brain regions such as amygdaloid complex, medial septum or hippocampus are critical in cognitive functions and appear as a pivotal target for drug design to improve learning and dysfunctions that manifest with age. Since treatments based on glutamatergic and cholinergic pharmacology in AD have shown limited success, therapies combining modulators of different neurotransmission systems including recent findings regarding the GABAergic system, emerge as a more useful tool for the treatment, and overall prevention, of this dementia. In this review, focused on inhibitory systems, we will analyze pharmacological strategies to compensate neurotransmission imbalance that might be considered as potential therapeutic interventions in AD.  
24987349	Compensating for thalamocortical synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease.
Front Comput Neurosci 20140617 2014
The study presents a thalamocortical network model which oscillates within the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) as recorded in the wakeful relaxed state with closed eyes to study the neural causes of abnormal oscillatory activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Incorporated within the model are various types of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons, recurrently connected to thalamic and reticular thalamic regions with the ratios and distances derived from the mammalian thalamocortical system. The model is utilized to study the impacts of four types of connectivity loss on the model's spectral dynamics. The study focuses on investigating degeneration of corticocortical, thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and corticoreticular couplings, with an emphasis on the influence of each modeled case on the spectral output of the model. Synaptic compensation has been included in each model to examine the interplay between synaptic deletion and compensation mechanisms, and the oscillatory activity of the network. The results of power spectra and event related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/S) analyses show that the dynamics of the thalamic and cortical oscillations are significantly influenced by corticocortical synaptic loss. Interestingly, the patterns of changes in thalamic spectral activity are correlated with those in the cortical model. Similarly, the thalamic oscillatory activity is diminished after partial corticothalamic denervation. The results suggest that thalamic atrophy is a secondary pathology to cortical shrinkage in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, this study finds that the inhibition from neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN) to thalamic relay (TCR) neurons plays a key role in regulating thalamic oscillations; disinhibition disrupts thalamic oscillatory activity even though TCR neurons are more depolarized after being released from RTN inhibition. This study provides information that can be explored experimentally to further our understanding on the neurodegeneration associated with AD pathology.  
24099709	Dual-functional nanoparticles targeting amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease mice.
Biomaterials 20131004 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with few treatments. The limitations imposed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the non-selective distribution of drugs in the brain have hindered the effective treatment of AD and may result in severe side effects on the normal brains. We developed a dual-functional nanoparticle drug delivery system based on a PEGylated poly (lactic acid) (PLA) polymer. Two targeting peptides that were screened by phage display, TGN and QSH, were conjugated to the surface of the nanoparticles. TGN specifically targets ligands at the BBB, while QSH has good affinity with AÎ²(1-42), which is the main component of amyloid plaque. Tests probing the bEnd.3 cell uptake and in vivo imaging were conducted to determine the best density of TGN on the nanoparticles' surfaces. The optimal amount of QSH was studied using a Thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. The optimal maleimide/peptide molar ratio was 3 for both TGN and QSH on the surface of the nanoparticles (T3Q3-NP), and these nanoparticles achieved enhanced and precise targeted delivery to amyloid plaque in the brains of AD model mice. A MTT assay also validated the safety of this dual-targeted delivery system; little cytotoxicity was demonstrated with both bEnd.3 and PC 12 cells. In conclusion, the T3Q3-NP might be a valuable targeting system for AD diagnosis and therapy. 
24515343	[Verbal fluency among healthy elderly: a study of three complex verbal fluency tasks under healthy older people and patients with neurocognitive disorder or onset dementia of the Alzheimer type].
Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr  2014Jun
The aim of this study is to provide normative data for a phonological alternating task (FAT), a semantic alternating task (SAT) and an excluded letter task (ELT). The tasks were administered to 146 Flemish-speaking, cognitively healthy elderly. Data from 102 were used and were classified according to the significant variables. Subsequently, these tasks were administered to seven patients diagnosed with mild neurocognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment, MCI) and seven patients with onset dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Results of the standard study show that the level of education is a significant variable for all complex VFT and age for the SAT and the ELT, while age related deterioration is highest for the ELT. The error rate is highest for the ELT and lowest for the SAT. Analysis of the time duration shows that data should be collected for at least 2 min. The patients scored significantly lower than the normgroup of healthy adults. The error rate is highest for the SAT and lowest for the ELT. 
24717850	Dihydrotestosterone treatment delays the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in SAMP8 mice.
Horm Behav 20140406 2014May
The senescence-accelerated-prone mouse 8 (SAMP8) has been proposed as a suitable, naturally derived animal model for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the current study, we focus on the problem whether SAMP8 mice show abnormal behavioral and neuropathological signs before they present the characteristic of AD. Our results demonstrated that given the presence of the senescent, behavioral and neuropathological characteristics, the "middle-aged" SAMP8 mice appear to be a suitable and naturally derived animal model for MCI basic research. There is relatively less evidence that androgen may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. We determined testosterone (T) levels of SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice and found that the marked age-related decrease in serum androgen levels may be one of the risk factors for Alzheimer's dementia. We also evaluated the interventional effect on MCI phase by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in male SAMP8 mice and found that timely and appropriate androgen intervention can postpone the onset and improve the symptoms of dementia.  
24861066	[Care relationship between the family caregiver and the elderly with Alzheimer].
Rev Bras Enferm  2014 Mar-Apr
Cross-sectional quantitative and qualitative-descriptive study, aimed to interpret the relationship in the caring of family caregivers and Alzheimer's elderly sufferers, grounded in the concrete dialectic of participation according to Gabriel Marcel's four precepts. The convenience sample entailed 208 family caregivers in the quantitative and 36 in the qualitative aspect. The caregivers were women (n=178, 86%), aged 22-83 years, living with the elderly (n=169, 81%), with more than eight years of formal education (n=147, 71%), not having an occupation (n=121, 58%) and with mild burden (n=96, 46.2%). The synthesis theme was The order of mystery pervaded by faith and supported by hope. The relationship between family members and Alzheimer's elderly sufferer encompasses love, faithfulness, hope and presence. Interpreting this relationship enables nurses to develop sensitivity and creativity for professional practice, taking into account the subjectivity and mystery in human relations.  
24834443	Mo polyoxometalate nanoclusters capable of inhibiting the aggregation of AÎ²-peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease.
Nanoscale  2014Jun21
A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is aggregation of a forty-residue peptide known as amyloid beta forty (AÎ²40). While past work has indicated that blocking AÎ²40 aggregation could be an effective strategy for the treatment of AD, developing therapies with this goal has been met with limited success. Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been previously investigated for their anti-viral and anti-tumoral properties and we report here that three representative POM nanoclusters have been synthesized for use against AÎ²40 aggregation. Through the use of thioflavin T fluorescence, turbidity, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that all three POM complexes can significantly inhibit both natural AÎ²40 self-aggregation and metal-ion induced AÎ²40 aggregation. We also evaluated the protective effect of POM complexes on AÎ²40-induced neurotoxicity in cultured PC12 cells and found that treatment with POM complexes can elevate cell viability, decrease levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings indicate that all three representative POM complexes are capable of inhibiting AÎ²40 aggregation and subsequent neurotoxicity. While a complete mechanistic understanding remains to be elucidated, the synthesized POM complexes may work through a synergistic interaction with metal ions and AÎ²40. These data indicate that POM complexes have high therapeutic potential for use against one of the primary neuropathological features of AD.  
24642954	Quetiapine attenuates recognition memory impairment and hippocampal oxidative stress in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroreport  2014Jun18
Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, may have beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the effect of quetiapine on object recognition memory in AD has never been measured. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of quetiapine on object recognition memory and on oxidative stress that could be involved in the AD pathogenesis in an amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 double transgenic mouse model of AD. Nontransgenic and transgenic mice were treated with quetiapine (0 or 5 mg/kg/day) in drinking water from the age of 2 months. After 10 months of continuous quetiapine administration, object recognition memory impairment and the increased hippocampal protein expression of nitrotyrosine, a protein marker of oxidative stress, were attenuated in the AD mice. These results suggest that quetiapine can attenuate object recognition memory impairment and brain oxidative stress in an amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 transgenic mouse model of AD and indicate that the antioxidative effect of early quetiapine intervention may be associated with the beneficial effect of quetiapine on memory in AD.  
24655686	Decreasing sense of coherence and its determinants in spousal caregivers of persons with mild Alzheimer's disease in three year follow-up: ALSOVA study.
Int Psychogeriatr 20140321 2014Jul
Sense of coherence (SOC) is associated with the capability to cope with caregiving. Our aims were (1) to describe the trajectory of SOC in aged spousal caregivers of persons with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 3-year follow-up and (2) to identify baseline determinants influencing SOC change. Both AD (n = 170) (CDR-SOB, MMSE, NPI, ADCS-ADL) and caregiver- (n = 170) (BDI, SOC) related efficacy parameters were evaluated annually. Follow-up time was 3 years. The relationship of potential baseline factors with longitudinal SOC was analyzed using linear mixed models. The mean drop-out-adjusted SOC score (148.5 at baseline) was decreased by 4.56 points (p = 0.002) during the follow-up. Caregivers' depression at baseline predicted the significant decrease of SOC (every + 1 BDI point decreases 2.181 points in SOC, p = 0.0001). When caregiver's depression was not taken into account in the analysis, female gender, and higher age and AD patient's lower baseline MMSE were associated significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with decreasing SOC score in the follow-up. Other studied covariates were not associated with SOC change. SOC is not as stable as expected, but decreases during long-lasting caregiving. Caregiver's depression at baseline predicts SOC decrease over time. In the future, caregiver dependent factors should be evaluated at the beginning of caregiving to target individualized support programmes to the vulnerable caregivers. 
24697954	Disorders of "taste cognition" are associated with insular involvement in patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: "memory of food is impaired in dementia and responsible for poor diet".
Int Psychogeriatr 20140403 2014Jul
In dementia patients, dietary intake problems may occur despite the absence of swallowing problems. We investigated cognitive functions on food and taste in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) patients. Participants included 15 healthy controls (HC), 30 AD and 20 VaD patients. Food Cognition Test: Replicas of three popular foods in Japan with no odors were presented visually to each participant, with the instruction to respond with the name of each food. Replicas of food materials were subsequently presented to ask whether they were included in these foods. Taste Cognition Test: Replicas of 12 kinds of foods were presented to describe their expected tastes. The AD/VaD groups exhibited significantly lower scores on Food/Taste Cognition Tests compared with the HC group. These scores correlated inversely with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the AD group. Decreased dietary intake was observed in 12 of the 50 patients; 8 of the 12 exhibited decreased Taste Cognition Test scores, higher than that of the normal-intake patients. There was no difference in the filter paper taste disc test between HC/AD/VaD groups. To test the hypothesis that the insula is associated with taste cognition, two MMSE-matched AD subgroups (n = 10 vs. 10) underwent positron emission tomography. Glucose metabolism in the right insula was lower in the low taste cognition subgroup. The VaD patients with insular lesions exhibited impaired Taste Cognition Test findings. It is important to consider the cognitive aspect of dietary intake when we care for dementia patients. 
24780594	Multifunctional nanoliposomes with curcumin-lipid derivative and brain targeting functionality with potential applications for Alzheimer disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140418 2014Jun10
With the objective to formulate multifunctional nanosized liposomes to target amyloid deposits in Alzheimer Disease (AD) brains, a lipid-PEG-curcumin derivative was synthesized and characterized. Multifunctional liposomes incorporating the curcumin derivative and additionally decorated with a Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) transport mediator (anti-Transferin antibody) were prepared and characterized. The fluorescence intensity of curcumin derivative was found to increase notably when the curcumin moiety was in the form of a diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) salt. Both curcumin-derivative liposomes and curcumin-derivative Anti-TrF liposomes showed a high affinity for the amyloid deposits, on post-mortem brains samples of AD patients. The ability of both liposomes to delay AÎ²1-42 peptide aggregation was confirmed by Thioflavin assay. However, the decoration of the curcumin-derivative liposomes with the Anti-TrF improved significantly the intake by the BBB cellular model. Results verify that the attachment of an antibody on the curcumin-liposome surface does not block deposit staining or prevention of AÎ² aggregation, while the presence of the curcumin-PEG-lipid conjugate does not reduce their brain-targeting capability substantially, proving the potential of such multifunctional NLs for application in Alzheimer disease treatment and diagnosis.  
24813882	Donepezil + propargylamine + 8-hydroxyquinoline hybrids as new multifunctional metal-chelators, ChE and MAO inhibitors for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140429 2014Jun10
The synthesis, biochemical evaluation, ADMET, toxicity and molecular modeling of novel multi-target-directed Donepezil + Propargylamine + 8-Hydroxyquinoline (DPH) hybrids 1-7 for the potential prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease is described. The most interesting derivative was racemic Î±-aminotrile4-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-2-(((8-hydroxyquinolin-5-yl)methyl)(prop-2-yn-1-yl)amino) butanenitrile (DPH6) [MAO A (IC50 = 6.2 Â± 0.7 Î¼M; MAO B (IC50 = 10.2 Â± 0.9 Î¼M); AChE (IC50 = 1.8 Â± 0.1 Î¼M); BuChE (IC50 = 1.6 Â± 0.25 Î¼M)], an irreversible MAO A/B inhibitor and mixed-type AChE inhibitor with metal-chelating properties. According to docking studies, both DPH6 enantiomers interact simultaneously with the catalytic and peripheral site of EeAChE through a linker of appropriate length, supporting the observed mixed-type AChE inhibition. Both enantiomers exhibited a relatively similar position of both hydroxyquinoline and benzyl moieties with the rest of the molecule easily accommodated in the relatively large cavity of MAO A. For MAO B, the quinoline system was hosted at the cavity entrance whereas for MAO A this system occupied the substrate cavity. In this disposition the quinoline moiety interacted directly with the FAD aromatic ring. Very similar binding affinity values were also observed for both enantiomers with ChE and MAO enzymes. DPH derivatives exhibited moderate to good ADMET properties and brain penetration capacity for CNS activity. DPH6 was less toxic than donepezil at high concentrations; while at low concentrations both displayed a similar cell viability profile. Finally, in a passive avoidance task, the antiamnesic effect of DPH6 was tested on mice with experimentally induced amnesia. DPH6 was capable to significantly decrease scopolamine-induced learning deficits in healthy adult mice.

24059295	Current view from Alzheimer disease to type 2 diabetes mellitus.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory problems. It has been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus at both the molecular and biochemical level. Pancreatic cells have molecular similarities to the brain at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Several genes have been reported to be responsible for both AD and diabetes. Currently, no proper treatment is available but various therapeutic approaches are utilized worldwide for the management of these disorders and may be nanoparticles and herbal treatment of Bacopa monnieri will make promise for the treatment of AD in future. The formation of amyloids in neurons and the formation of amylin in pancreatic cells are potential links between these two disorders, which can be silent killers. 
24059298	An association of virus infection with type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose due to insulin deficiency or resistance. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease leading to irreversible loss of neurons, intellectual abilities, memory and reasoning. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes and AD in elderly population is a major public health concern. Interestingly, both health issues are unraveling the puzzling links. The clinico-pathological relationship between diabetes and AD has been reported at genomic and proteomic levels. The association of virus infection in type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD has been reported in few recent studies, some have shown direct evidence of virus infection in diabetes and AD while other have shown that diabetes increases the risk of developing AD. This review aims to summarize the association of few common viruses like Hepatitis C Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus-1 which affects both these two age-related devastating diseases. We also discuss the pathological links of Influenza virus, Cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus, Enterovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus-2, Hepatitis viruses in diabetes and Influenza virus, Picornavirus and Borna disease virus in AD. Establishing such relationships and defining their common pathogenesis and patho-physiological mechanisms may lead to new concepts and paths for developing novel preventive strategies and pharmacological treatment options for diabetes and AD. This study may aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of likely blood-based viral biomarkers for early diagnosis of diabetes and AD with high sensitivity and specificity. 
24059302	Invokana (Canagliflozin) as a dual inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and sodium glucose co-transporter 2: advancement in Alzheimer's disease- diabetes type 2 linkage via an enzoinformatics study.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a primary target for Alzheimer's therapy while recently sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) has gained importance as a potential target for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) therapy. The present study emphasizes the molecular interactions between a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antidiabetic drug 'Invokana' (chemically known as Canagliflozin) with AChE and SGLT2 to establish a link between the treatment of T2DM and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Docking study was performed using 'Autodock4.2'. Both hydrophobic and Ï€-Ï€ interactions play an important role in the correct positioning of Canagliflozin within SGLT2 and catalytic site (CAS) of AChE to permit docking. Free energy of binding (Î”G) for 'Canagliflozin-SGLT2' interaction and 'Canagliflozin - CAS domain of AChE' interaction were found to be -10.03 kcal/mol and -9.40 kcal/mol, respectively. During 'Canagliflozin-SGLT2' interaction, Canagliflozin was found to interact with the most important amino acid residue Q457 of SGLT2. This residue is known for its interaction with glucose during reabsorption in kidney. However, 'Canagliflozin-CAS domain of AChE' interaction revealed that out of the three amino acids constituting the catalytic triad (S203, H447 and E334), two amino acid residues (S203 and H447) interact with Canagliflozin. Hence, Invokana (Canagliflozin) might act as a potent dual inhibitor of AChE and SGLT2. However, scope still remains in the determination of the three-dimensional structure of SGLT2-Canagliflozin and AChE-Canagliflozin complexes by X-ray crystallography to validate the described data. Since the development of diabetes is associated with AD, the design of new AChE inhibitors based on antidiabetic drug scaffolds would be particularly beneficial. Moreover, the present computational study reveals that Invokana (Canagliflozin) is expected to form the basis of a future dual therapy against diabetes associated neurological disorders. 
24059303	A nanotechnological approach to the management of Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are both prevalent in older individuals and have gained significant attention due to alarming rates of increase. The high incidences of these diseases pose a great socioeconomic burden and cause major public health concerns worldwide. A number of studies have established potential links between AD and T2D, supporting the hypothesis that T2D is linked with an increased risk of AD and that controlling diabetes could have a positive impact on the prevention of AD. At present, both diseases lack precise diagnostic approaches for early intervention and effective cure. Further, the currently available diagnostic tools for AD screening are insufficiently sensitive and robust for preventive measures. Although several drugs are used for the treatment of both these diseases, none of these drugs offers complete remission of the disease, merely symptomatic relief. Moreover, these drugs have limited efficacy because of problems such as conventional drug delivery systems beyond the blood brain barrier, a lack of target specificity and diminished potency. From this perspective, the emerging field of nanotechnology has offered new techniques and tools to overcome these challenges. In this review, we discuss the direct and indirect limitations of existing therapies and describe alternative potential nanotechnological approaches that could be utilized to overcome these limitations. New insight in the field of nanomedicine is necessary for early diagnosis, the development of novel drug therapies, the action of drugs and prevention, as well as for gaining an in-depth understanding of the complex biology of both diseases. 
24059304	Bacteriophage--a common divergent therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes mellitus.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease, the most important neurodegenerative disorder, is an irreversible, age-dependent disease of the brain characterized by problems in progressive impairments in memory, language, reasoning, behavior and visuospatial skills. It is characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta peptide, forming compact fibrillar plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. Another major and much more prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in world is diabetes especially type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is caused by a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. Chronic wounds caused by antibiotic resistant bacterial infections that fail to heal are a common complication of diabetes mellitus and the most frequent reason for nontraumatic lower limb amputation. Holistically, these two diseases are linked at molecular level but the exact mechanism is a topic of debate. Bacteriophages are viruses infecting bacteria and lack ability to infect mammalian cells. They are neither causative agent for Alzheimer's disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus nor involved in their pathogenicity but promises for a novel divergent therapeutic approach. The great versatility of the phage system has led to the development of improved phage delivery vectors, as well as immunomodulation of anti-amyloid beta peptide response. Phages could also constitute valuable prophylaxis against bacterial infections, especially in immunocompromised patients like in the case of diabetes. Patients having diabetes have a high risk of developing foot ulcers which are difficult to be treated by antibiotics alone due to ever increasing antibiotic resistance strains. Combination therapy based on multiple phage and broad spectrum antibiotics holds great promise. The potential therapeutic phage therapy arises from its lack of natural tropism for mammalian cells, resulting in no adverse effects. 
24059308	Establishing genomic/transcriptomic links between Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus by meta-analysis approach.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
Meta-analysis methods exist for combining multiple microarray datasets. However, there are a wide range of issues associated with microarray meta-analysis and a limited ability to compare the performance of different metaanalysis methods. Using cDNA microarray technology (Partek Genomics Suite 6.6) and global pathway analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (IPA, Inc), we examined the transcript level in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls. To understand the molecular link between T2DM and AD, we compared the gene expression pattern and pathway involved. Microarray analysis identified 235 differentially expressed genes between T2DM patients and controls; and 834 between AD and controls at two fold change and a false discovery rate of 0.05. Significantly changed expression of "myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1; RAS guanyl releasing protein 1; S100 calcium-binding protein A8; prostaglandin- endoperoxide synthase 2; parvalbumin; endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1; phosphoglycerate kinase 1; Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F; Interleukin-1 beta; tubulin, beta 2A; glycine receptor alpha 1 and ribosomal protein S24" genes were highly associated with T2DM, whereas "neuronal differentiation 6; G-protein coupled receptor 83; phosphoserine phosphatase; bobby sox homolog or HMG box -containing protein 2; Glutathione S-transferase theta 1; alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 zinc-binding; Heat shock 70kDa protein 1B; transportin 1, Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member B; Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase B; prenylcysteine oxidase 1 like" were found to be strongly related with AD. We also found a set of differentially expressed genes; "ARP2 actin-related protein 2; Cell division control protein 42; cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4; Early growth response protein 1; ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 5; folate receptor 1; glutamate-ammonia ligase; hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase; 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; interleukin 1 receptor- like 1; leukemia inhibitory factor receptor; metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4; phosphoserine phosphatase, parvalbumin, and tubulin, beta 2A" to be present in both dataset. Altered regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, including Ephrin receptor, liver X receptor/ retinoid X receptor; interleukin 6; insulinlike growth factor 1; interleukin 10 and 14-3-3-mediated signaling pathways were associated with T2DM as well as Alzheimer-type pathology. Our findings implicate diabetic disorders in the pathogenesis of AD, and provide a basis for future candidate studies based on specific pathways. 
24059310	How do periodontal infections affect the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease?
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
Chronic infection can cause slow progressive dementia, cortical atrophy and amyloid deposition in the atrophic form of general paresis. Due to the fact that specific bacterial ligands can increase the expression of proinflammatory molecules that can activate innate and adaptive immune systems, inflammation may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, there is a significant association between AD and various types of spirochete. Periodontitis is a prevalent and persistent peripheral infection that is associated with gram-negative anaerobic bacteria and is capable of showing localized and systemic infections in the host. Periodontal disease related pathogens and their inflammatory products contribute to systemic inflammation and the pathogenesis of AD. In this minireview, we propose a hypothetical link between periodontitis, type 2 diabetes and AD. We also present the possible mechanistic links between periodontitis-related inflammation, type 2 diabetes and AD. Since this condition is treatable, periodontitis may be a readily-modifiable risk factor for AD. 
24059311	A possible link of gut microbiota alteration in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease pathogenicity: an update.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
Imbalances in gut microbiota are associated with metabolic disorder, which are a group of obesity-related metabolic abnormalities that increase an individual's risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although a number of risk factors have been postulated that may trigger the development of AD, the root cause of this disease is still a matter of debate. This review further investigates the etiology of AD by accumulating the current role played by gut microbiota in human, and trying to establish an inter-link between T2D and AD pathogenesis. There is a growing body of evidence which suggests that obesity is associated with alteration in the normal gut flora, reduced bacterial diversity, metabolic pathways and altered representation of bacterial genes. Obesity and T2D are considered to be induced as a result of changes within the composition of gut microbiota. The evidence gathered so far clearly advocates the involvement of gut microbes in causing obesity, a state of chronic and low-grade inflammation. Hence, understanding the microbiota of the gut is significant in relation to inflammation, as it is a key contributor for diabetes which has a direct relation to the AD pathogenesis. Comparative analysis of gut microbiota may enable further novel insight into the complex biology of AD, which is very important in order to take preventive measure such as early diagnosis, identification of new therapeutic targets and development of novel drugs. 
24365186	Humanin: a possible linkage between Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Apr
The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is higher among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. In T2DM patients, the progression of AD is more rapid. Furthermore, several pathophysiological pathways are common to AD and T2DM. Humanin is a recently introduced, mitochondrial-derived peptide with neuroprotective effects. Humanin can alter the mechanisms involved in AD and T2DM pathogenesis. Insulin resistance as well as oxidative stress has been shown to be associated with increased amyloid deposition in brain neurons and islet beta cells. Moreover, advanced glycation end products and lipid metabolism disorders are common pathways of oxidative stress and low-grade systemic inflammation in AD and T2DM. These common pathways may explain AD and T2DM pathogenesis and suggest common treatments for both diseases. Treatments for T2DM and AD attempt to slow cognitive decline, and recent investigations have focused on agents that may alter pathways common to AD and T2DM pathogenesis. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as interleukin-1 antagonists and statins, are possible drug candidates for both AD and T2DM. 
24760581	Grey-matter volume as a potential feature for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: an exploratory study.
Neurosci Bull 20140423 2014Jun
Specific patterns of brain atrophy may be helpful in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we set out to evaluate the utility of grey-matter volume in the classification of AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) compared to normal control (NC) individuals. Voxel-based morphometric analyses were performed on structural MRIs from 35 AD patients, 27 aMCI patients, and 27 NC participants. A two-sample two-tailed t-test was computed between the NC and AD groups to create a map of abnormal grey matter in AD. The brain areas with significant differences were extracted as regions of interest (ROIs), and the grey-matter volumes in the ROIs of the aMCI patients were included to evaluate the patterns of change across different disease severities. Next, correlation analyses between the grey-matter volumes in the ROIs and all clinical variables were performed in aMCI and AD patients to determine whether they varied with disease progression. The results revealed significantly decreased grey matter in the bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampus, the bilateral superior/middle temporal gyri, and the right precuneus in AD patients. The grey-matter volumes were positively correlated with clinical variables. Finally, we performed exploratory linear discriminative analyses to assess the classifying capacity of grey-matter volumes in the bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampus among AD, aMCI, and NC. Leave-one-out cross-validation analyses demonstrated that grey-matter volumes in hippocampus and parahippocampus accurately distinguished AD from NC. These findings indicate that grey-matter volumes are useful in the classification of AD. 
24961717	Nutrient intake and brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in at-risk cognitively normal individuals: a cross-sectional neuroimaging pilot study.
BMJ Open 20140624 2014
There is increasing evidence to suggest that diet, one of the most important modifiable environmental factors, may play a role in preventing or delaying cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examines the relationship between dietary nutrients and brain biomarkers of AD in cognitively normal individuals (NL) with and without AD risk factors. As part of an ongoing brain imaging study, participants received clinical and laboratory examinations, a neurocognitive test battery, positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB; a measure of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) load) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; a proxy of neuronal activity), and completed semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. Research centre affiliated with the Alzheimer's disease Core Center at New York University School of Medicine. 49 NL individuals (age 25-72â€…years, 69% women) with dietary information, (11)C-PiB and (18)F-FDG PET scans were examined. Controlling for age and total caloric intake, higher intake of vitamin B12, vitamin D and Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was associated with lower AÎ² load in AD regions on PiB-PET, while higher intake of Î²-carotene and folate was associated with higher glucose metabolism on FDG-PET. Î²-carotene and folate were associated with reduced glucose metabolism for women, apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE4) carriers and participants with positive AD family history, but not for their risk-free counterparts. The associations of vitamin B12, vitamin D and Ï‰-3 PUFA with PiB retention were independent of gender, APOE and family history. The identified nutrient combination was associated with higher intake of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, fish and legumes, and lower intake of high-fat dairies, meat and sweets. Our data provide a potential pathophysiological mechanism for epidemiological findings showing that dietary interventions may play a role in the prevention of AD. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether there is a direct link between nutrient intake, brain biomarkers and risk of AD. 
24450891	Two phase 3 trials of bapineuzumab in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
N. Engl. J. Med.  2014Jan23
Bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody, is in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials involving patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease--one involving 1121 carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 allele and the other involving 1331 noncarriers. Bapineuzumab or placebo, with doses varying by study, was administered by intravenous infusion every 13 weeks for 78 weeks. The primary outcome measures were scores on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11, with scores ranging from 0 to 70 and higher scores indicating greater impairment) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD, with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating less impairment). A total of 1090 carriers and 1114 noncarriers were included in the efficacy analysis. Secondary outcome measures included findings on positron-emission tomographic amyloid imaging with the use of Pittsburgh compound B (PIB-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau) concentrations. There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcomes. At week 78, the between-group differences in the change from baseline in the ADAS-cog11 and DAD scores (bapineuzumab group minus placebo group) were -0.2 (P=0.80) and -1.2 (P=0.34), respectively, in the carrier study; the corresponding differences in the noncarrier study were -0.3 (P=0.64) and 2.8 (P=0.07) with the 0.5-mg-per-kilogram dose of bapineuzumab and 0.4 (P=0.62) and 0.9 (P=0.55) with the 1.0-mg-per-kilogram dose. The major safety finding was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema among patients receiving bapineuzumab, which increased with bapineuzumab dose and APOE Îµ4 allele number and which led to discontinuation of the 2.0-mg-per-kilogram dose. Between-group differences were observed with respect to PIB-PET and cerebrospinal fluid phospho-tau concentrations in APOE Îµ4 allele carriers but not in noncarriers. Bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with Alzheimer's disease, despite treatment differences in biomarkers observed in APOE Îµ4 carriers. (Funded by Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy and Pfizer; Bapineuzumab 301 and 302 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00575055 and NCT00574132, and EudraCT number, 2009-012748-17.). 
24760018	Aminostyrylbenzofuran directly reduces oligomeric amyloid-Î² and reverses cognitive deficits in Alzheimer transgenic mice.
PLoS ONE 20140423 2014
Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid-Î² into neurotoxic oligomers and plaques. Although many disease-modifying molecules are currently in Alzheimer clinical trials, a small molecule that inhibits amyloid-Î² aggregation and ameliorates the disorder has not been approved to date. Herein, we report the effects of a potent small molecule, 6-methoxy-2-(4-dimethylaminostyryl) benzofuran (KMS88009), that directly disrupts amyloid-Î² oligomerization, preserving cognitive behavior when used prophylactically and reversing declines in cognitive behavior when used therapeutically. KMS88009 exhibited excellent pharmacokinetic profiles with extensive brain uptake and a high level of safety. When orally administered before and after the onset of Alzheimer's disease symptoms, KMS88009 significantly reduced assembly of amyloid-Î² oligomers and improved cognitive behaviors in the APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse model. The unique dual mode of action indicates that KMS88009 may be a powerful therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  
24725624	Which language declines more? longitudinal versus cross-sectional decline of picture naming in bilinguals with Alzheimer's disease.
J Int Neuropsychol Soc 20140411 2014May
In this study, we investigated dual-language decline in non-balanced bilinguals with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) both longitudinally and cross-sectionally. We examined patients' naming accuracy on the Boston Naming Test (BNT: Kaplan et al., 1983) over three testing sessions (longitudinal analysis) and compared their performance to that of matched controls (cross-sectional analysis). We found different longitudinal and cross-sectional patterns of decline: Longitudinally, the non-dominant language seemed to decline more steeply than the dominant language, but, cross-sectionally, differences between patients and controls were larger for the dominant than for the non-dominant language, especially at the initial testing session. This differential pattern of results for cross-sectional versus longitudinal decline was supported by correlations between decline measures and BNT item characteristics. Further studies will be needed to better characterize the nature of linguistic decline in bilinguals with AD; however, these results suggest that representational robustness of individual lexical representations, rather than language membership, might determine the time course of decline for naming in bilinguals with AD. 
24785240	Detecting everyday action deficits in Alzheimer's disease using a nonimmersive virtual reality kitchen.
J Int Neuropsychol Soc 20140501 2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes impairments affecting instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Transdisciplinary research in neuropsychology and virtual reality has fostered the development of ecologically valid virtual tools for the assessment of IADL, using simulations of real life activities. Few studies have examined the benefits of this approach in AD patients. Our aim was to examine the utility of a non-immersive virtual coffee task (NI-VCT) for assessment of IADL in these patients. We focus on the assessment results obtained from a group of 24 AD patients on a task designed to assess their ability to prepare a virtual cup of coffee, using a virtual coffee machine. We compared performance on the virtual task to an identical daily living task involving the actual preparation of a cup of coffee, as well as to global cognitive, executive, and caregiver-reported IADL functioning. Relative to 32 comparable, healthy elderly (HE) controls, AD patients performed worse than HE controls on all tasks. Correlation analyses revealed that NI-VCT measures were related to all other neuropsychological measures. Moreover, regression analyses demonstrated that performance on the NI-VCT predicted actual task performance and caregiver-reported IADL functioning. Our results provide initial support for the utility of our virtual kitchen for assessment of IADL in AD patients. 
24871648	A systematic review on natural medicines for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease with meta-analyses of intervention effect of ginkgo.
Am. J. Chin. Med.  2014
We performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of natural medicines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Disease-specific and intervention terms were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO to identify RCTs for the AD intervention of natural medicines, and searched for literatures in English language. The RCTs compared natural medicines and either placebo or orthodox medication in AD patients. The quality of literature was evaluated by Jadad's score and the Cochrane assessing tool to reduce the risk of bias. Meta-analysis and the heterogeneity of results across the trials were performed. Out of the literatures, 21 clinical reports were included in this review that satisfied the particular selection criteria. Apart from Ginkgo, other treatments we came across had minimal benefits and/or the methodological quality of the available trials was poor. The meta-analyses showed that Ginkgo had better outcomes than the placebo, with the standardized mean difference (SMD) between Ginkgo and the placebo on cognition being -1.62 (95% CI: -2.69 to -0.56) and on activities of daily living being -1.55 (95% CI: -2.55 to -0.55), with the existence of significant heterogeneity across studies. The meta-analysis for assessing the prevention effect of Ginkgo against AD suggested that risk ratio (RR) is 1.06 (95% CI: 0.92 to 1.22) between Gingko and the placebo, with no significant heterogeneity across studies (test for heterogeneity, p = 0.49). Our results suggest that Ginkgo may help established AD patients with cognitive symptoms but cannot prevent the neurodegenerative progression of the disease.  
24556551	Latent information in fluency lists predicts functional decline in persons at risk for Alzheimer disease.
Cortex 20140116 2014Jun
We constructed random forest classifiers employing either the traditional method of scoring semantic fluency word lists or new methods. These classifiers were then compared in terms of their ability to diagnose Alzheimer disease (AD) or to prognosticate among individuals along the continuum from cognitively normal (CN) through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Semantic fluency lists from 44 cognitively normal elderly individuals, 80 MCI patients, and 41 AD patients were transcribed into electronic text files and scored by four methods: traditional raw scores, clustering and switching scores, "generalized" versions of clustering and switching, and a method based on independent components analysis (ICA). Random forest classifiers based on raw scores were compared to "augmented" classifiers that incorporated newer scoring methods. Outcome variables included AD diagnosis at baseline, MCI conversion, increase in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score, or decrease in Financial Capacity Instrument (FCI) score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each classifier and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. We compared AUC between raw and augmented classifiers using Delong's test and assessed validity and reliability of the augmented classifier. Augmented classifiers outperformed classifiers based on raw scores for the outcome measures AD diagnosis (AUC .97 vs. .95), MCI conversion (AUC .91 vs. .77), CDR-SOB increase (AUC .90 vs. .79), and FCI decrease (AUC .89 vs. .72). Measures of validity and stability over time support the use of the method. Latent information in semantic fluency word lists is useful for predicting cognitive and functional decline among elderly individuals at increased risk for developing AD. Modern machine learning methods may incorporate latent information to enhance the diagnostic value of semantic fluency raw scores. These methods could yield information valuable for patient care and clinical trial design with a relatively small investment of time and money. 
24026422	Genetic interactions found between calcium channel genes modulate amyloid load measured by positron emission tomography.
Hum. Genet. 20130912 2014Jan
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is known to have a complex, oligogenic etiology, with considerable genetic heterogeneity. We investigated the influence of genetic interactions between genes in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathway on amyloid-beta (AÎ²) deposition as measured by PiB or AV-45 ligand positron emission tomography (PET) to aid in understanding LOAD's genetic etiology. Subsets of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts were used for discovery and for two independent validation analyses. A significant interaction between RYR3 and CACNA1C was confirmed in all three of the independent ADNI datasets. Both genes encode calcium channels expressed in the brain. The results shown here support previous animal studies implicating interactions between these calcium channels in amyloidogenesis and suggest that the pathological cascade of this disease may be modified by interactions in the amyloid-calcium axis. Future work focusing on the mechanisms of such relationships may inform targets for clinical intervention.  
24276092	Brain differences in infants at differential genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer disease: a cross-sectional imaging study.
JAMA Neurol  2014Jan
Converging evidence suggests brain structure alterations may precede overt cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease by several decades. Early detection of these alterations holds inherent value for the development and evaluation of preventive treatment therapies. To compare magnetic resonance imaging measurements of white matter myelin water fraction (MWF) and gray matter volume (GMV) in healthy infant carriers and noncarriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 allele, the major susceptibility gene for late-onset AD. Quiet magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research imaging center on 162 healthy, typically developing 2- to 25-month-old infants with no family history of Alzheimer disease or other neurological or psychiatric disorders. Cross-sectional measurements were compared in the APOE Îµ4 carrier and noncarrier groups. White matter MWF was compared in one hundred sixty-two 2- to 25-month-old sleeping infants (60 Îµ4 carriers and 102 noncarriers). Gray matter volume was compared in a subset of fifty-nine 6- to 25-month-old infants (23 Îµ4 carriers and 36 noncarriers), who remained asleep during the scanning session. The carrier and noncarrier groups were matched for age, gestational duration, birth weight, sex ratio, maternal age, education, and socioeconomic status. Automated algorithms compared regional white matter MWF and GMV in the carrier and noncarrier groups and characterized their associations with age. Infant Îµ4 carriers had lower MWF and GMV measurements than noncarriers in precuneus, posterior/middle cingulate, lateral temporal, and medial occipitotemporal regions, areas preferentially affected by AD, and greater MWF and GMV measurements in extensive frontal regions and measurements were also significant in the subset of 2- to 6-month-old infants (MWF differences, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.05, after correction for multiple comparisons; GMV differences, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). Infant Îµ4 carriers also exhibited an attenuated relationship between MWF and age in posterior white matter regions. While our findings should be considered preliminary, this study demonstrates some of the earliest brain changes associated with the genetic predisposition to AD. It raises new questions about the role of APOE in normal human brain development, the extent to which these processes are related to subsequent AD pathology, and whether they could be targeted by AD prevention therapies. 
24164735	Association of mediterranean diet with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
To conduct a systematic review of all studies to determine whether there is an association between the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) and cognitive impairment. We conducted a comprehensive search of the major databases and hand-searched proceedings of major neurology, psychiatry, and dementia conferences through November 2012. Prospective cohort studies examining the MeDi with longitudinal follow-up of at least 1 year and reporting cognitive outcomes (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or Alzheimer's disease [AD]) were included. The effect size was estimated as hazard-ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q-test and I2-statistic. Out of the 664 studies screened, five studies met eligibility criteria. Higher adherence to the MeDi was associated with reduced risk of MCI and AD. The subjects in the highest MeDi tertile had 33% less risk (adjusted HR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.81; p &lt; 0.0001) of cognitive impairment (MCI or AD) as compared to the lowest MeDi score tertile. Among cognitively normal individuals, higher adherence to the MeDi was associated with a reduced risk of MCI (HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96; p = 0.02) and AD (HR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.89; p = 0.007). There was no significant heterogeneity in the analyses. While the overall number of studies is small, pooled results suggest that a higher adherence to the MeDi is associated with a reduced risk of developing MCI and AD, and a reduced risk of progressing from MCI to AD. Further prospective-cohort studies with longer follow-up and randomized controlled trials are warranted to consolidate the evidence. Systematic review registration number: PROSPERO 2013: CRD42013003868. 
24533013	Multi-Target-Directed Ligands and other Therapeutic Strategies in the Search of a Real Solution for Alzheimer's Disease.
Curr Neuropharmacol  2014Jan
The lack of an adequate therapy for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) contributes greatly to the continuous growing amount of papers and reviews, reflecting the important efforts made by scientists in this field. It is well known that AD is the most common cause of dementia, and up-to-date there is no prevention therapy and no cure for the disease, which contrasts with the enormous efforts put on the task. On the other hand many aspects of AD are currently debated or even unknown. This review offers a view of the current state of knowledge about AD which includes more relevant findings and processes that take part in the disease; it also shows more relevant past, present and future research on therapeutic drugs taking into account the new paradigm "Multi-Target-Directed Ligands" (MTDLs). In our opinion, this paradigm will lead from now on the research toward the discovery of better therapeutic solutions, not only in the case of AD but also in other complex diseases. This review highlights the strategies followed by now, and focuses other emerging targets that should be taken into account for the future development of new MTDLs. Thus, the path followed in this review goes from the pathology and the processes involved in AD to the strategies to consider in on-going and future researches.  
24773532	The C-terminal threonine of AÎ²43 nucleates toxic aggregation via structural and dynamical changes in monomers and protofibrils.
Biochemistry 20140507 2014May20
Recent studies suggest that deposition of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) into oligomeric aggregates and fibrils, hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, may be initiated by the aggregation of AÎ² species other than the well-studied 40- and 42-residue forms, AÎ²40 and AÎ²42, respectively. Here we report on key structural, dynamic, and aggregation kinetic parameters of AÎ²43, extended by a single threonine at the C-terminus relative to AÎ²42. Using aggregation time course experiments, electron microscopy, and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements including backbone relaxation, dark-state exchange saturation transfer, and quantification of chemical shift differences and scalar coupling constants, we demonstrate that the C-terminal threonine in AÎ²43 increases the rate and extent of protofibril aggregation and confers slow C-terminal motions in the monomeric and protofibril-bound forms of AÎ²43. Relative to the neighboring residues, the hydrophilic Thr43 of AÎ²43 favors direct contact with the protofibril surface more so than the C-terminus of AÎ²40 or AÎ²42. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of a small chemical modification to affect the properties of AÎ² structure and aggregation, providing a mechanism for the potential role of AÎ²43 as a primary nucleator of AÎ² aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.  
24681664	Non-invasive assessment of Alzheimer's disease neurofibrillary pathology using 18F-THK5105 PET.
Brain 20140327 2014Jun
Non-invasive imaging of tau pathology in the living brain would be useful for accurately diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, tracking disease progression, and evaluating the treatment efficacy of disease-specific therapeutics. In this study, we evaluated the clinical usefulness of a novel tau-imaging positron emission tomography tracer 18F-THK5105 in 16 human subjects including eight patients with Alzheimer's disease (three male and five females, 66-82 years) and eight healthy elderly controls (three male and five females, 63-76 years). All participants underwent neuropsychological examination and 3D magnetic resonance imaging, as well as both 18F-THK5105 and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography scans. Standard uptake value ratios at 90-100 min and 40-70 min post-injection were calculated for 18F-THK5105 and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B, respectively, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. As a result, significantly higher 18F-THK5105 retention was observed in the temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, frontal and mesial temporal cortices of patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with healthy control subjects. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, the inferior temporal cortex, which is an area known to contain high densities of neurofibrillary tangles in the Alzheimer's disease brain, showed prominent 18F-THK5105 retention. Compared with high frequency (100%) of 18F-THK5105 retention in the temporal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease, frontal 18F-THK5105 retention was less frequent (37.5%) and was only observed in cases with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, 11C-Pittsburgh compound B retention was highest in the posterior cingulate cortex, followed by the ventrolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and superior temporal cortices, and did not correlate with 18F-THK5105 retention in the neocortex. In healthy control subjects, 18F-THK5105 retention was âˆ¼10% higher in the mesial temporal cortex than in the neocortex. Notably, unlike 11C-Pittsburgh compound B, 18F-THK5105 retention was significantly correlated with cognitive parameters, hippocampal and whole brain grey matter volumes, which was consistent with findings from previous post-mortem studies showing significant correlations of neurofibrillary tangle density with dementia severity or neuronal loss. From these results, 18F-THK5105 positron emission tomography is considered to be useful for the non-invasive assessment of tau pathology in the living brain. This technique would be applicable to the longitudinal evaluation of tau deposition and allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. 
24480815	Regional atrophy of the insular cortex is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease patients.
Eur. Neurol. 20140125 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating illness that results in progressive cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with a rapid decline in cognition and activities of daily living and increased mortality, however the neuroanatomical localisation involved in the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify the association with the regional volume of the insular cortex and each neuropsychiatric symptom in patients with AD. Subjects diagnosed with AD (n = 40) were evaluated. Magnetic resonance images were obtained and the insular cortex was subdivided into four subregions through the central sulcus of the insula and bilaterally: right anterior insular cortex, right posterior insular cortex, left anterior insular cortex and left posterior insular cortex. The neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. A partial correlation analysis was performed. A significant negative correlation existed between apathy, the irritability subscale score and the volume ratio of the bilateral anterior insular cortex and right posterior insular cortex (r = -0.457, -0.433 and -0.572, respectively, p = 0.032, 0.044 and 0.005, respectively). The findings suggest that the regional atrophy of the insular cortex is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients. 
24654702	Chemical engineering of self-assembled Alzheimer's peptide on a silanized silicon surface.
Langmuir 20140513 2014May27
The aim of this work is to develop a sensitive and specific immune-sensing platform dedicated to the detection of potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in biological fluids. Accordingly, a controlled and adaptive surface functionalization of a silicon wafer with 7-octenyltrichlorosilane has been performed. The surface has extensively been characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM; morphology) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; chemical composition) and contact angle measurements. The wettability of the grafted chemical groups demonstrated the gradual trend from hydrophilic to hydrophobic surface during functionalization. XPS evidenced the presence of silanes on the surface after silanization, and even carboxylic groups as products from the oxidation step of the functionalization process. The characterization results permitted us to define an optimal protocol to reach a high-quality grafting yield. The issue of the quality of controlled chemical preparation on bioreceiving surfaces was also investigated by the recognition of one AD biomarker, the amyloid peptide AÎ² 1-42. We have therefore evaluated the biological activity of the grafted anti AÎ² antibodies onto this silanized surface by fluorescent microscopy. In conclusion, we have shown, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the uniformity of the optimized functionalization on slightly oxidized silicon surfaces, providing a reliable and chemically stable procedure to determine specific biomarkers of Alzheimer disease. This work opens the route to the integration of controlled immune-sensing applications on lab-on-chip systems.

23986293	Electroencephalogram global field synchronization analysis: a new method for assessing the progress of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.
Clin EEG Neurosci 20130827 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Global field synchronization (GFS) can measure functional synchronization in frequency-domain electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The aim of this study is to explore GFS values and its clinical significance for severity of cognitive decline in AD. EEGs were recorded from 37 AD patients and 37 age-matched healthy individuals. GFS values were calculated in delta, theta, alpha, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma, and full frequency bands. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) were employed to assess symptom severity in AD patients. Correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis were performed to analyze the relationship between GFS values and MoCA scores in AD patients. GFS values of the beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and full bands were lower in AD patients than in healthy individuals, and positively correlated with MoCA and CDR scores in the combined group (AD patients and healthy individuals). GFS values were positively correlated with MoCA socres in 3 beta bands and full bands, and with CDR scores in the delta band. There was a good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating of GFS values and MoCA scoring (Îº = .913, P &lt; .001). In conclusion, the present results indicated that GFS can serve as an indicator of cognitive decline or impairment in AD patients. Furthermore, the GFS method of EEG holds considerable promise to distinguish mild cognitive impairment from serious cognitive impairment in patients with AD.  
24131618	Clinician's road map to wavelet EEG as an Alzheimer's disease biomarker.
Clin EEG Neurosci 20131016 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the main cause of dementia in Western countries. Consequently, there is a need for an accurate, universal, specific and cost-effective biomarker for early AD diagnosis, to follow disease progression and therapy response. This article describes a new diagnostic approach to quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) diagnosis of mild and moderate AD. The data set used in this study was composed of EEG signals recorded from 2 groups: (S1) 74 normal subjects, 33 females and 41 males (mean age 67 years, standard deviation = 8) and (S2) 88 probable AD patients (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria), 55 females and 33 males (mean age 74.7 years, standard deviation = 7.8) with mild to moderate symptoms (DSM-IV-TR). Attention is given to sample size and the use of state of the art open source tools (LetsWave and WEKA) to process the EEG data. This innovative technique consists in associating Morlet wavelet filter with a support vector machine technique. A total of 111 EEG features (attributes) were obtained for 162 probands. The results were accuracy of 92.72% and area under the curve of 0.92 (percentage split test). Most important, comparing a single patient versus the total data set resulted in accuracy of 84.56% (leave-one-patient-out test). Particular emphasis was on clinical diagnosis and feasibility of implementation of this low-cost procedure, because programming knowledge is not required. Consequently, this new method can be useful to support AD diagnosis in resource-limited settings.  
24755620	Overrepresentation of glutamate signaling in Alzheimer's disease: network-based pathway enrichment using meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.
PLoS ONE 20140422 2014
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified several risk loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, these loci do not explain the entire susceptibility of the disease, suggesting that other genetic contributions remain to be identified. Here, we performed a meta-analysis combining data of 4,569 individuals (2,540 cases and 2,029 healthy controls) derived from three publicly available GWAS in AD and replicated a broad genomic region (&gt;248,000 bp) associated with the disease near the APOE/TOMM40 locus in chromosome 19. To detect minor effect size contributions that could help to explain the remaining genetic risk, we conducted network-based pathway analyses either by extracting gene-wise p-values (GW), defined as the single strongest association signal within a gene, or calculated a more stringent gene-based association p-value using the extended Simes (GATES) procedure. Comparison of these strategies revealed that ontological sub-networks (SNs) involved in glutamate signaling were significantly overrepresented in AD (p&lt;2.7Ã—10(-11), p&lt;1.9Ã—10(-11); GW and GATES, respectively). Notably, glutamate signaling SNs were also found to be significantly overrepresented (p&lt;5.1Ã—10(-8)) in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, which was used as a targeted replication sample. Interestingly, components of the glutamate signaling SNs are coordinately expressed in disease-related tissues, which are tightly related to known pathological hallmarks of AD. Our findings suggest that genetic variation within glutamate signaling contributes to the remaining genetic risk of AD and support the notion that functional biological networks should be targeted in future therapies aimed to prevent or treat this devastating neurological disorder. 
24859733	Successful non-operative management of spontaneous type II gallbladder perforation in a patient with Alzheimer's disease.
BMJ Case Rep 20140523 2014
A 77-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease was admitted to a rural hospital in June 2012 and an acute cholecistytis was first diagnosed. Surgery was not considered as a possible option due to the critical condition of the patient and his severe comorbidities. After 2â€…days of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient worsened and developed severe sepsis. A gallbladder perforation with intrahepatic abscess formation was diagnosed on ultrasonography (US) and abdominal CT scan. The patient underwent percutaneous US-guided gallbladder drainage with resolution of the sepsis and rapid clinical improvement. After 1â€…month, the drainage was removed and the patient was discharged. He survived in good condition for 18â€…months and he passed away from pneumonitis in December 2013. This case shows that in a case of acute cholecystitis with gallbladder perforation, percutaneous gallbladder drainage can be a lifesaving procedure in elderly patients with severe comorbidities (including Alzheimer's disease) who are not candidates for elective surgery.  
24747275	Inhalation of coriander volatile oil increased anxiolytic-antidepressant-like behaviors and decreased oxidative status in beta-amyloid (1-42) rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
Physiol. Behav. 20140418 2014May28
The present study analyzed the possible anxiolytic, antidepressant and antioxidant proprieties of inhaled coriander volatile oil extracted from Coriandrum sativum var. microcarpum in beta-amyloid (1-42) rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of inhaled coriander volatile oil were studied by means of in vivo (elevated plus-maze and forced swimming tests) approaches. Also, the antioxidant activity in the hippocampus was assessed using catalase specific activity and the total content of the reduced glutathione. The beta-amyloid (1-42)-treated rats exhibited the following: decrease of the locomotor activity, the percentage of the time spent and the number of entries in the open arm within elevated plus-maze test and decrease of swimming and immobility times within forced swimming test. Exposure to coriander volatile oil significantly improved these parameters, suggesting anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, coriander volatile oil decreased catalase activity and increased glutathione level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that multiple exposures to coriander volatile oil can be useful as a mean to counteract anxiety, depression and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease conditions.  
24637264	The mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ extends lifespan and improves healthspan of a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer disease.
Free Radic. Biol. Med. 20140315 2014Jun
Î²-Amyloid (AÎ²)-induced toxicity and oxidative stress have been postulated to play critical roles in the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer disease (AD). We investigated the in vivo ability of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, to protect against AÎ²-induced toxicity and oxidative stress in a Caenorhabditis elegans model overexpressing human AÎ². Impairment of electron transport chain (ETC) enzymatic activity and mitochondrial dysfunction are early features of AD. We show that MitoQ extends lifespan, delays AÎ²-induced paralysis, ameliorates depletion of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin, and protects complexes IV and I of the ETC. Despite its protective effects on lifespan, healthspan, and ETC function, we find that MitoQ does not reduce DCFDA fluorescence, protein carbonyl levels or modulate steadystate ATP levels or oxygen consumption rate. Moreover, MitoQ does not attenuate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage. In agreement with its design, the protective effects of MitoQ appear to be targeted specifically to the mitochondrial membrane and our findings suggest that MitoQ may have therapeutic potential for AÎ²- and oxidative stress-associated neurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD.  
24675226	Redox proteomics analysis of HNE-modified proteins in Down syndrome brain: clues for understanding the development of Alzheimer disease.
Free Radic. Biol. Med. 20140325 2014Jun
Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, due to partial or complete triplication of chromosome 21. DS subjects are characterized by a number of abnormalities including premature aging and development of Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology after approximately 40 years of age. Several studies show that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the development of neurodegeneration in the DS population. Increased lipid peroxidation is one of the main events causing redox imbalance within cells through the formation of toxic aldehydes that easily react with DNA, lipids, and proteins. In this study we used a redox proteomics approach to identify specific targets of 4-hydroxynonenal modifications in the frontal cortex from DS cases with and without AD pathology. We suggest that a group of identified proteins followed a specific pattern of oxidation in DS vs young controls, probably indicating characteristic features of the DS phenotype; a second group of identified proteins showed increased oxidation in DS/AD vs DS, thus possibly playing a role in the development of AD. The third group of comparison, DS/AD vs old controls, identified proteins that may be considered specific markers of AD pathology. All the identified proteins are involved in important biological functions including intracellular quality control systems, cytoskeleton network, energy metabolism, and antioxidant response. Our results demonstrate that oxidative damage is an early event in DS, as well as dysfunctions of protein-degradation systems and cellular protective pathways, suggesting that DS subjects are more vulnerable to oxidative damage accumulation that might contribute to AD development. Further, considering that the majority of proteins have been already demonstrated to be oxidized in AD brain, our results strongly support similarities with AD in DS.  
24522515	Zinc and its effects on oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurol. Sci. 20140213 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder. The patho-physiological characteristic of AD is abnormal deposition of fibrillar amyloid Î² protein, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative damage and neuronal death in the brain. Zinc is an important trace element in human body regulating many physiological processes. Increasing evidence suggests that the etiology of AD may involve disruptions of zinc homeostasis, and oxidative stress facilitating reactive oxygen species production is an early and sustained event in AD disease progression. Both Zn deficiency and Zn overload may affect cellular Zn distribution and be linked to neurodegeneration in AD. Meanwhile, Zn may play paradoxical roles in initiating and inhibiting oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. This review will focus on aspects of the role of zinc in AD, which includes a large body of research regarding zinc dyshomeostasis and its relation with oxidative stress.  
24971061	Interactions of metals and Apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140612 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which is characterized by the neuropathological accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Clinically, patients will endure a gradual erosion of memory and other higher order cognitive functions. Whilst the underlying etiology of the disease remains to be definitively identified, a body of work has developed over the last two decades demonstrating that AD plasma/serum and brain are characterized by a dyshomeostasis in a number of metal ions. Furthermore, these metals (such as zinc, copper and iron) play roles in the regulation of the levels of AD-related proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau. It is becoming apparent that metals also interact with other proteins, including apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is critically associated with AD, with APOE4 representing the strongest genetic risk factor for the development of late-onset AD. In this review we will summarize the evidence supporting a role for metals in the function of ApoE and its consequent role in the pathogenesis of AD.  
24589556	Arg972 insulin receptor substrate-1 polymorphism and risk and severity of Alzheimer's disease.
J Clin Neurosci 20131219 2014Jul
We explored the association between the Arg972 insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) polymorphism and the risk and severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We genotyped the Arg972 IRS1 (rs1801278) polymorphism in 1123 pairs of age, sex, body mass index, residence area and education level-matched Han Chinese AD patients and controls. AD severity was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. The AA (homozygous Arg972 IRS1) and GA (heterozygous Arg972 IRS1) genotypes were associated with an increased risk of AD after adjustment for comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and hypertension (p&lt;0.001; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.93 and 2.90, respectively). The A allele was associated with an increased risk of AD after adjustment for comorbidities (p&lt;0.001; adjusted OR 2.26; 95% confidence interval 1.92-2.80). The percentage of Arg972 IRS1 AA homozygotes was higher in the MMSE score â©½14 category than in the MMSE score 15-26 category overall and in each age group (p&lt;0.001), while the wild type IRS1 GG homozygotes were predominantly found in the MMSE score 15-26 category overall and in each age group. The GG homozygote group had higher MMSE score than the GA heterozygote group, which in turn had higher MMSE score than the AA homozygote group overall and in each age group (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the Arg972 IRS1 polymorphism is an independent risk factor for AD and the A allele has a gene dosage effect on AD severity in Han Chinese. This study adds fresh insights into the pathogenesis of AD.

THIS BOOK could be subtitled 'a doctor writes'. The author is, we are told, 'a leading expert on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias' and he takes an unashamedly evidence-based medical approach. The best chapters are those that provide an overview of prevention, disease processes, medication and future directions in medical treatment. They provide clear, up-to-date summaries that will be valuable for medical students, junior doctors and specialist nurses, but which will inevitably soon become out of date, given the rapidly developing research field.  
24852227	Understanding the cause of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
Expert Rev Neurother  2014Jun
The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a lack of effective prevention or disease-modifying therapies are global challenges with devastating personal, social and economic consequences. The amyloid Î² (AÎ²) hypothesis posits that cerebral Î²-amyloidosis is a critical early event in AD pathogenesis. However, failed clinical trials of AÎ²-centric drug candidates have called this hypothesis into question. Whereas we acknowledge that the AÎ² hypothesis is far from disproven, we here re-visit the links between AÎ², tau and neurodegeneration. We review the genetics, epidemiology and pathology of sporadic AD and give an updated account of what is currently known about the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. 
24440055	Synergistic effects of amyloid-beta and wild-type human tau on dendritic spine loss in a floxed double transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20140114 2014Apr
Synapse number is the best indicator of cognitive impairment In Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the respective contributions of AÎ² and tau, particularly human wild-type tau, to synapse loss remain undefined. Here, we sought to elucidate the AÎ²-dependent changes in wild-type human tau that trigger synapse loss and cognitive decline in AD by generating two novel transgenic mouse models. The first overexpresses floxed human APP with Swedish and London mutations under the thy1 promoter, and recapitulates important features of early AD, including accumulation of soluble AÎ² and oligomers, but no plaque formation. Transgene excision via Cre-recombinase reverses cognitive decline, even at 18-months of age. Secondly, we generated a human wild-type tau-overexpressing mouse. Crossing of the two animals accelerates cognitive impairment, causes enhanced accumulation and aggregation of tau, and results in reduction of dendritic spines compared to single transgenic hTau or hAPP mice. These results suggest that AÎ²-dependent acceleration of wild-type human tau pathology is a critical component of the lasting changes to dendritic spines and cognitive impairment found in AD.  
23924172	Meditation and neurodegenerative diseases.
Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 20130807 2014Jan
Neurodegenerative diseases pose a significant problem for the healthcare system, doctors, and patients. With an aging population, more and more individuals are developing neurodegenerative diseases and there are few treatment options at the present time. Meditation techniques present an interesting potential adjuvant treatment for patients with neurodegenerative diseases and have the advantage of being inexpensive, and easy to teach and perform. There is increasing research evidence to support the application of meditation techniques to help improve cognition and memory in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the current data on meditation, memory, and attention, and the potential applications of meditation techniques in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.  
24673372	Economic analysis of opportunities to accelerate Alzheimer's disease research and development.
Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 20140327 2014Apr
The development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) faces a number of barriers. Among these are the lack of surrogate biomarkers, the exceptional size and duration of clinical trials, difficulties in identifying appropriate populations for clinical trials, and the limitations of monotherapies in addressing such a complex multifactorial disease. This study sets out to first estimate the consequent impact on the expected cost of developing disease-modifying treatments for AD and then to estimate the potential benefits of bringing together industry, academic, and government stakeholders to co-invest in, for example, developing better biomarkers and cognitive assessment tools, building out advanced registries and clinical trial-readiness cohorts, and establishing clinical trial platforms to investigate combinations of candidate drugs and biomarkers from the portfolios of multiple companies. Estimates based on interviews with experts on AD research and development suggest that the cost of one new drug is now $5.7 billion (95% confidence interval (CI) $3.7-9.5 billion) and could be reduced to $2.0 billion (95% CI $1.5-2.9 billion). The associated acceleration in the arrival of disease-modifying treatments could reduce the number of case years of dementia by 7.0 million (95% CI 4.4-9.4 million) in the United States from 2025 through 2040.  
24754377	Alzheimer's disease research and development: a call for a new research roadmap.
Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.  2014Apr
Epidemiological projections of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the rapidly expanding population over the age of 65, and the enormous societal consequence on health, economics, and community foretell of a looming global public health crisis. Currently available treatments for AD are symptomatic, with modest effect sizes and limited impact on longer term disease outcomes. There have been no newly approved pharmaceutical treatments in the last decade, despite enormous efforts to develop disease-modifying treatments directed at Alzheimer's-associated pathology. An unprecedented collaborative effort of government, regulators, industry, academia, and the community at-large is needed to address this crisis and to develop an actionable plan for rapid progress toward successfully developing effective treatments. Here, we map out a course of action in four key priority areas, including (1) addressing the fundamental mechanisms of disease, with the goal of developing a core set of research tools, a framework for data sharing, and creation of accessible validated and replicated disease models; (2) developing translational research that emphasizes rapid progress in disease model development and better translation from preclinical to clinical stages, deploying leading technologies to more accurately develop predictive models; (3) preventing AD through the development of robust methods and resources to advance trials and creating fundamental resources such as continuous adaptive trials, registries, data repositories, and instrument development; and (4) innovating public/private partnerships and global collaborations, with mechanisms to incentivize collaborations and investments, develop larger precompetitive spaces, and more rapid data sharing.  
24963289	Usability Study of a Wireless Monitoring System among Alzheimer's Disease Elderly Population.
Int J Telemed Appl 20140520 2014
Healthcare technologies are slowly entering into our daily lives, replacing old devices and techniques with newer intelligent ones. Although they are meant to help people, the reaction and willingness to use such new devices by the people can be unexpected, especially among the elderly. We conducted a usability study of a fall monitoring system in a long-term nursing home. The subjects were the elderly with advanced Alzheimer's disease. The study presented here highlights some of the challenges faced in the use of wearable devices and the lessons learned. The results gave us useful insights, leading to ergonomics and aesthetics modifications to our wearable systems that significantly improved their usability and acceptance. New evaluating metrics were designed for the performance evaluation of usability and acceptability.  
23948941	Insulin/IGF signaling-related gene expression in the brain of a sporadic Alzheimer's disease monkey model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
We reported previously that the intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (icv-STZ)-treated cynomolgus monkey showed regionally specific glucose hypometabolism in FDG-PET imaging, similar to that observed in the early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). However, further pathological analyses of this model at the molecular level are needed to validate it as a feasible model for sAD. Two cynomolgus monkeys were injected with 2 mg/kg STZ into the cerebellomedullary cistern at day 1, 7 and 14. Two control monkeys were given normal saline. At 5 months after injection, the expression levels of genes encoding 9 upstream molecules in insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and markers for 4 cell-type populations in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and occipital cortex of control and icv-STZ treated cynomolgus monkeys were examined. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses demonstrated that the overall mRNA expression of insulin/IGF signaling-related genes was mainly impaired in the anterior part of the cerebrum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus, similar to the early stage of sAD. The changes were accompanied by the loss of oligodendrocytes and neurons. The posterior part of the cerebrum did not show degenerative alterations. The present study provides important fundamental information on the icv-STZ monkey model for sAD. These results may help guide future studies using this model for the investigation of pathological mechanisms and the development of drugs for sAD.  
23948943	Cellular prion protein as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Soluble oligomeric species of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide are presumed to be drivers of synaptic impairment, and the resulting cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. In 2009, cellular prion protein (PrPC) was identified in a genome-wide screen as a high-affinity receptor for AÎ² oligomers, and since then, many studies have explored the role of PrPC in Alzheimer's disease. Herein, I systematically assess the current level of target validation for PrPC in Alzheimer's disease and the merits of the identified approaches to therapeutically affect the PrPC:AÎ² oligomer-interaction. The interaction of AÎ² oligomers with PrPC in mice impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation, memory, and learning in a manner that involves Fyn, tau, and glutamate receptors. Furthermore, PrPC acts to catalyze the formation of certain AÎ² oligomeric species in the synapse and may mediate the toxic effects of other Î²-sheet rich oligomers as well. Therapeutic approaches utilizing soluble PrPC ectodomain or monoclonal antibodies targeting PrPC can at least partially prevent the neurotoxic effects of AÎ² oligomers in mice.  
23963288	Distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from normal pressure hydrocephalus: a search for MRI biomarkers.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Currently, no clinical or neuroradiological techniques have been validated to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) from idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). Both share anatomical and clinical similarities: AD is a form of irreversible degenerative dementia, whereas the dementia manifested in iNPH is potentially "reversible" through various neurosurgical procedures. Hence, it is important to find specific imaging biomarkers that distinguish the two conditions. In addition, the ability to predict the response to neurosurgery in iNPH is something that has yet to be accomplished. In this systematic review, we describe and critically analyze the merits and drawbacks of the MR imaging parameters currently used to distinguish AD from iNPH and assess ways to predict the response after treatment of iNPH. We conclude that the combination of different neuroimaging sequences as well as quantitative and qualitative parameters could provide new insight for better diagnosis and treatment of these two different diseases.  
23963291	Chromosome 19p in Alzheimer's disease: when genome meets transcriptome.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Genetic studies have identified several genomic loci including chr19p13.2 relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility. However, the functional roles of these genomic loci in AD pathogenesis require further clarification. Transcriptome as an endophenotype is critical for the understanding of disease mechanism. Here we demonstrate that chr19p is the most significantly perturbed chromosome region in AD brain transcriptome. With dual evidence from genome and transcriptome, chr19p likely play a special role in AD pathogenesis.  
23969994	Efficacy of musical interventions in dementia: evidence from a randomized controlled trial.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Although musical interventions have recently gained popularity as a non-pharmacological treatment in dementia, there is still insufficient evidence of their effectiveness. To investigate this issue, a single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted with forty-eight patients with Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia to compare the effects of music versus cooking interventions in the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral domain, as well as on professional caregiver distress. Each intervention lasted four weeks (two one-hour sessions a week). Multi-component evaluations (with blind assessors) were conducted before, during, and after the interventions to assess their short and long-term effects (up to four weeks post interventions). Analyses revealed that both music and cooking interventions led to positive changes in the patients' emotional state and decreased the severity of their behavioral disorders, as well as reduced caregiver distress. However, no benefit on the cognitive status of the patients was seen. While results did not demonstrate a specific benefit of music on any of the considered measures, the present study suggests the efficacy of two pleasant non-pharmacological treatments in patients with moderate to severe dementia. Our findings highlight the potential of such interventions in improving the well-being of patients living in residential care, as well as reducing caregiver distress.  
23969995	Memory for past public events depends on retrieval frequency but not memory age in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by retrograde memory deficits primarily caused by dysfunction of the hippocampal complex. Unresolved questions exist concerning the time course of hippocampal involvement in conscious recollection of declarative knowledge, as reports of temporal gradients of retrograde amnesia have been inconclusive. The aim of this study was to examine whether the extent and severity of retrograde amnesia is mediated by retrieval frequency or, in contrast, whether it depends on the age of the memory according to the assumptions of the main current theories of memory formation. We compared recall of past public events in patients with AD and healthy control (HC) individuals using the Historic Events Test (HET). The HET assesses knowledge about famous public events of the past 60 years divided into four time segments and consists of subjective memory rating, dating accuracy, and contextual memory tasks. Although memory for public events was impaired in AD patients, there was a strong effect of retrieval frequency across all time segments and both groups. As AD and HC groups derived similar benefits from greater retrieval frequency, cortical structures other than the hippocampal complex may mediate memory retrieval. These findings suggest that more frequently retrieved events and facts become more independent of the hippocampal complex and thus better protected against early damage of AD. This could explain why cognitive activity may delay the onset of memory decline in persons who develop AD.  
23969996	Constructional apraxia as a distinctive cognitive and structural brain feature of pre-senile Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Constructional apraxia (CA) is often, but not always, observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). CA is usually explained by impairment of either basic perceptual and motor abilities, or executive functions. This study aims to evaluate the structural correlates of CA in AD. Forty-eight patients with AD and 20 healthy age-matched controls underwent a thorough neuropsychological investigation and an MRI scan to collect high-resolution T1-weighted data. Patients were classified as having (ADca) or not having (ADnonca) CA based on performance on the Freehand copying of drawings task. T1-weighted volumes were process according to the voxel based morphometry protocol, to assess the presence of significant differences in local to grey matter volumes in patients compared to controls and in ADca compared to ADnonca. Post-hoc, the mean grey matter volume of clusters that resulted significantly different between groups was regressed against the neuropsychological scores in which the two patient groups performed differently. A pre-senile disease onset was significantly more frequent in patients with CA compared to ADnonca. ADca patients also showed worse performances than patients with ADnonca at some tests requiring the processing of visuo-spatial data and testing working memory. They also showed widespread reductions in grey matter volume, mainly located in areas known to be implicated in object recognition and localization, and in maintenance and re-orienting of spatial attention. These findings suggest that the occurrence of CA in AD is often associated with a peculiar clinical onset (i.e., pre-senile), neuropsychological profile, and distribution of grey matter atrophy.  
23979023	Differential activation of mTOR complex 1 signaling in human brain with mild to severe Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling has been suggested to be effective in modifying cognitive status in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about its role in AD patients. We hereby tested whether mTOR signaling was activated and whether activated mTOR signaling was related to the degree of cognitive deficits in patients with AD. Autopsy brain hippocampal tissues were obtained from controls and patients with AD and Western blots were performed using antibodies against mTOR signaling molecules and RagC, an upstream component of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. We found that expression of mTOR/p-mTOR and its downstream targets S6/p-S6 and Raptor/p-Raptor were expressed in the control and AD hippocampus. The expression levels of these signaling molecules were significantly increased in the hippocampus at the severe stages of AD, compared to controls and other stages of AD. Interestingly, Rictor expression level was unaltered. In addition, RagC was increased in the hippocampus at the early, moderate, and severe stages of AD. Our data indicate that mTORC1, but not mTORC2, was activated in the AD brains and that the level of mTOR signaling activation was correlated with cognitive severity of AD patients.  
23979024	Serum adipokine levels modified by donepezil treatment in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Neurotransmitter enhancement therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) is a clinically proven approach for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Donepezil is one of the three currently approved AChEIs for treating AD symptoms delaying the decline in cognitive function. In addition to cholinergic hypofunction, there are several factors in AD pathogenesis. For example, adipocytokines released from adipose tissue are also thought to play a role in the progress of dementia. Adipokines, i.e., leptin and adiponectin, are involved in the modulation of certain cognitive functions in the brain. The goal of our study was to elucidate effects of donepezil therapy on the serum levels of certain adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin in AD patients. Clinically diagnosed mild-to-moderate AD patients (n = 26) were involved in this open-labeled, single-center, prospective self-control study. ApoE polymorphism, serum adiponectin, leptin, LDL, HDL, triglyceride levels, and BMI were determined before and at 12 and 24 weeks intervals of donepezil treatment, respectively. Twenty-four weeks of donepezil treatment induced a linear decrease of serum leptin levels (p = 0.013) and a linear elevation of serum adiponectin levels (p = 0.007). BMI (p &lt; 0.001) and abdominal circumference (p = 0.017) were significantly lower at 24 weeks as compared to control values. None of the other examined metabolic parameters were changed during the treatment period. This previously unrecognized serum adipokine regulating potential of donepezil may be relevant in its therapeutic, disease modifying effect in AD by transferring protective (by increasing serum adiponectin levels) and detrimental (by decreasing serum leptin levels) effects onto the neurodegenerative process at the same time.  
23979026	A complex proinflammatory role for peripheral monocytes in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
An impairment of the microglial catabolic mechanisms allows amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) accumulation in plaques within the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Monocytes/macrophages (M/M) are activated in AD and migrate thorough the blood-brain barrier (BBB) trying to improve AÎ² clearing. In the attempt to shed light on the role of M/M in AD, these cells were analyzed in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in age-matched healthy controls. Results obtained in AÎ²42-stimulated cell cultures showed that significantly higher percentages of inflammatory M/M (CD14+ CD16-CCR2++CX3CR1low) expressing toll like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, as well as IL-6 and CCR2, a chemokine favoring M/M migration through the BBB, are seen in AD. Confocal microscopy suggested the presence of MHC-II/AÎ²42 complexes on AD M/M alone. Finally, TRL3- and TLR8-expressing and IL-23-producing M/M were increased in both AD and MCI compared to HC. These data indicate that M/M in AD are characterized by an inflammatory profile and are involved in the induction of both innate immune responses via TLR stimulation and of acquired immunity possibly secondarily to the presentation of AÎ² peptides in an MHC-restricted fashion. Therapeutic approaches designed to interrupt these mechanism might prove beneficial.  
23985416	Therapeutic effect of exogenous hsp70 in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Brain deterioration resulting from "protein folding" diseases, such as the Alzheimer's disease (AD), is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the aging human population. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) constitute the major cellular quality control system for proteins that mitigates the pathological burden of neurotoxic protein fibrils and aggregates. However, the therapeutic effect of Hsps has not been tested in a relevant setting. Here we report the dramatic neuroprotective effect of recombinant human Hsp70 in the bilateral olfactory bulbectomy model (OBX mice) and 5XFAD mouse models of neurodegeneration. We show that intranasally-administered Hsp70 rapidly enters the afflicted brain regions and mitigates multiple AD-like morphological and cognitive abnormalities observed in model animals. In particular, in both cases it normalizes the density of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex which correlates with the diminished accumulation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide and, in the case of 5XFAD mice, reduces AÎ² plaque formation. Consistently, Hsp70 treatment also protects spatial memory in OBX and 5XFAD mice. These studies demonstrate that exogenous Hsp70 may be a practical therapeutic agent for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal protein biogenesis and cognitive disturbances, such as AD, for which neuroprotective therapy is urgently needed.  
23985418	Vascular impairment in Alzheimer's disease: the role of obstructive sleep apnea.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Epidemiological studies have suggested a pathophysiological link between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanism by which sleep disturbance can affect cognitive impairment is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AD patients with OSAS have an impairment in cerebrovascular disease markers. We included 69 patients without OSAS and 93 patients with OSAS. They underwent an ultrasonographic assessment of common carotid arteries intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque index. Cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia in the middle cerebral arteries was calculated with the Breath-Holding Index (BHI). Pathological values of IMT and BHI were significantly associated with the presence of OSAS (IMT &gt; 1.0 mm: OR 2.98, 95%CI: 1.37-6.46; p &lt; 0.05; BHI &lt; 0.69: OR 5.25, 95%CI: 2.35-11.74; p &lt; 0.05, multivariate adjusted analysis). Furthermore, the extent of cerebrovascular impairment was correlated with the severity of OSAS. The finding of alterations of cerebral vessel functional and anatomic status in AD patients with OSAS suggests the potential for effective treatment for sleep-related disturbances in a subgroup of AD patients.  
23606378	Receiving while giving: the differential roles of receiving help and satisfaction with help on caregiver rewards among spouses and adult-children.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130422 2014Jan
There is a growing body of literature on the rewards associated with caregiving and the utility of these rewards on buffering the negative consequences of caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease. Many psychoeducational interventions aim to empower caregivers to seek and obtain help from their social support network, with the expectation that help will enable them to cope more effectively. This study investigated the impact of changes in help and changes in satisfaction with help on positive aspects of caregiving for both spouse (Nâ€‰=â€‰254) and adult-child (Nâ€‰=â€‰208) caregivers who attended a psychoeducational intervention. Analyses using structural equation modeling revealed that increases in amount of help and satisfaction with help were significantly linked with increases in caregiver rewards for adult-children. However, only increases in satisfaction with help were significantly related to increases in caregiver rewards for spouses. These group differences suggest that the quality of support is critical for spouses, whereas both quality and receiving extra help are useful for adult-child caregivers. These findings are discussed in terms of the importance of understanding the differential needs of spouse and adult-child caregivers in practice. 
23649902	Patient and carer views on participating in clinical trials for prodromal Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130506 2014Jan
There is great interest in conducting clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies in the prodromal (early, pre-dementia), asymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. Diagnostic biomarker tests offer a means of identifying prodromal patients, but it is unclear how potential participants feel about their use. Deciding whether to take part in a clinical trial is a complex process in which eligible participants must balance risks and discomforts against uncertain benefits. We sought to explore the views of potential participants through qualitative research methods. Focus groups with people with early memory problems, current and former family carers explored attitudes towards participating in clinical trials in the prodromal stages of the disease, using an example of anti-amyloid antibody-therapy (immunotherapy), which are currently in development. Despite the complexities involved, almost all participants had a clear idea about whether they, personally, would like to take part. Many were highly motivated to obtain an unambiguous diagnosis, regardless of their desire to participate in a clinical trial. Participants expressed minimal concern regarding the risk of adverse events associated with immunotherapy, whereas certain tests and trial procedures provoked greater anxiety. People with memory problems were found to assess the study demands in relation to their own priorities and circumstances. The priorities of patients might be different to clinicians and those who design and regulate clinical trials. Patient views can be used to inform the ethical debate around the disclosure of biomarker status, the design of clinical trials and the content of trial information. 
23671016	Insight in Alzheimer's disease and its relation to psychiatric and behavioral disturbances.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130514 2014Jan
Individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) often have impaired awareness or a lack of insight into their cognitive deficits and functional abilities, especially in the later stages of the disease. Previous research has documented a relationship between depression and insight in AD, such that greater awareness of one's disease has been associated with a higher degree of depression. However, little is known about the relationship between insight, cognitive decline, and other psychiatric or behavioral problems associated with AD. This study included 107 outpatients who met criteria for probable AD. Instruments included the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale, the Apathy Evaluation Scale, and the mini mental state exam. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between insight and depressed mood, anxiety, psychosis, apathy, agitation, and behavioral retardation in AD patients after controlling for cognitive skills. Insight was found to significantly predict depressed mood, anxiety, and apathy even after controlling for global cognition. Greater insight was found to be associated with depressed mood and anxiety. However, impaired insight was associated with higher levels of apathy. Insight may be differentially related to mood symptoms and apathy within AD, such that patients with intact insight are more depressed, whereas patients with impaired insight are more apathetic. This suggests that assessment of insight in AD may complement the clinical evaluation of depression and apathy in AD and help guide the most appropriate interventions. Published 2013.

24042430	Postmenopausal hormone therapy is not associated with risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Epidemiol Rev 20130915 2014
The relationship of postmenopausal hormone therapy with all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease dementia has been controversial. Given continued interest in the role of hormone therapy in chronic disease prevention and the emergence of more prospective studies, we conducted a systematic review to identify all epidemiologic studies meeting prespecified criteria reporting on postmenopausal hormone therapy use and risk of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. A systematic search of Medline and Embase through December 31, 2012, returned 15 articles meeting our criteria. Our meta-analysis of any versus never use did not support the hypothesis that hormone therapy reduces risk of Alzheimer's disease (summary estimate = 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.66, 1.16). Exclusion of trial findings did not change this estimate. There were not enough all-cause dementia results for a separate meta-analysis, but when we combined all-cause dementia results (n = 3) with Alzheimer's disease results (n = 7), the summary estimate remained null (summary estimate = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.26). The limited explorations of timing of use-both duration and early initiation-did not yield consistent findings. Our findings support current recommendations that hormone therapy should not be used for dementia prevention. We discuss trends in hormone therapy research that could explain our novel findings and highlight areas where additional data are needed.  
24754675	Advances in quantitative structure-activity relationship models of anti-Alzheimer's agents.
Expert Opin Drug Discov 20140423 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the lethal diseases, mainly affecting older people. The unclear root cause and involvement of various enzymes in the pathological conditions confirm the complexity of the disease. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) techniques are of great significance in the design of drugs against AD. In the present review, the authors provide a basic background about AD and QSAR techniques. Furthermore, they review the various QSAR studies reported against various targets of AD. The information provided for each QSAR study includes chemical scaffold and target enzyme under study, applied QSAR technique and outcomes of the respective study. In silico techniques like QSAR hold great potential in designing leads against a complex disease like AD. In combination with other in silico techniques, QSAR can provide more useful and rational insight to facilitate the discovery of novel compounds. Only few QSAR studies on imaging agents have been reported; hence, more QSAR studies are recommended to explore the biomarker or imaging agents for improving diagnosis. Again, for proper symptomatic treatment, multi-target drugs acting on more than one target are required. Hence, more multi-target QSAR studies are recommended in future to achieve this goal. 
23857120	ATP5H/KCTD2 locus is associated with Alzheimer's disease risk.
Mol. Psychiatry 20130716 2014Jun
To identify loci associated with Alzheimer disease, we conducted a three-stage analysis using existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genotyping in a new sample. In Stage I, all suggestive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (at P&lt;0.001) in a previously reported GWAS of seven independent studies (8082 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases; 12â€‰040 controls) were selected, and in Stage II these were examined in an in silico analysis within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium GWAS (1367 cases and 12904 controls). Six novel signals reaching P&lt;5 Ã— 10(-6) were genotyped in an independent Stage III sample (the FundaciÃ³ ACE data set) of 2200 sporadic AD patients and 2301 controls. We identified a novel association with AD in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F0 (ATP5H)/Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 2 (KCTD2) locus, which reached genome-wide significance in the combined discovery and genotyping sample (rs11870474, odds ratio (OR)=1.58, P=2.6 Ã— 10(-7) in discovery and OR=1.43, P=0.004 in FundaciÃ³ ACE data set; combined OR=1.53, P=4.7 Ã— 10(-9)). This ATP5H/KCTD2 locus has an important function in mitochondrial energy production and neuronal hyperpolarization during cellular stress conditions, such as hypoxia or glucose deprivation.  
24785461	Identifying a C-terminal ATP binding sites-based novel Hsp90-Inhibitor in silico: a plausible therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease.
Med. Hypotheses 20140413 2014Jul
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder, which gradually and irreversibly destroys the intellectual and cognitive abilities of the brain. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90Î±) is a molecular chaperone which was found to regulate the function of number of client proteins including tau that is involved in the cause of the AD. Inhibition of Hsp90Î± by C-Terminal domain (CTD) ATP binding-site blockage might be used as an effective treatment strategy against the disease via degradation of tau proteins that are involved in the progression of the disease. Till date, a variety of drugs have been identified as Hsp90Î± inhibitors, which include Novobiocin, Clorobiocin, Epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) and Derrubone. However, which drug among the four binds to the CTD ATP binding site strongly and what are the specific residue responsible for such binding, have not been reported so far. We hypothesize that binding site for ATP of Hsp90Î± CTD contains multiple ATP binding sites. We also hypothesize that a drug which can bind to the ATP binding site of CTD strongly can inhibit Hsp90Î± function which is in turn redirects towards the proteasomal degradation of diseased client protein like tau in AD. Such inhibition will find a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of AD. The identification of ATP binding site of Hsp90Î± CTD was done using various software tools like Hex 6.3, CastP, protein Hydrophobicity plots, ATPint and LigPlot+ v.1.4.5. Docking experiments were conducted between Hsp90Î±CTD and its inhibitors at these ATP binding site using the Autodock 4.0. The docking energies were further compared to obtain the most effective Hsp90Î± inhibitor of CTD. From our experiments, Leucine (Leu) 665, Leu 666 and Leu 694 were predicted to be located in CTD ATP binding site. Furthermore, docking studies were performed of various Hsp90Î± inhibitors like Novobiocin, Clorobiocin, Epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) and Derrubone with the previously recognized ATP binding residues of CTD i.e. Leu 665, Leu 666 and Leu 694. The docking results of Derrubone showed the highest binding energy at all the three sites of ATP interaction. Additionally, Derrubone showed the best binding energy at Leu 666 (-7.53kcal/mol) compared to Leu 665 (-7.20kcal/mol) and Leu 694 (-6.67kcal/mol). Based on our findings, we propose that the recognized sites i.e. Leu665, Leu 666 and Leu694 could possibly be the binding sites of Hsp90Î± CTD for ATP and the Hsp90 inhibitors. It was predicted that Derrubone could bind with CTD of Hsp90Î± strongly and resulted tau protein degradation which might be considered to be a therapeutic approach in AD. 
24959193	Shen-zhi-ling oral liquid improves behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in Alzheimer's disease.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140518 2014
We evaluated the effects of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Shen-Zhi-Ling oral liquid (SZL) on the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among 98 patients with AD and BPSD enrolled (mean age, 57.2â€‰Â±â€‰8.9 years old), 91 (Mâ€‰=â€‰55, Fâ€‰=â€‰36; mean age, 57.2â€‰Â±â€‰9.7 years old) completed the study. Patients took either SZL (n = 45) or placebo granules (n = 46) in a double-blind manner for 20 weeks while maintaining other anticognitive medications unchanged. Changes in BPSD between week 0, week 10, week 20, and week 25 were assessed using the behavioral pathology in Alzheimer's disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale and the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) represented by diurnal activity (DA), evening activity (EA), and nocturnal activity (NA) according to actigraphic recordings. SZL but not placebo oral liquid delayed the development of BPSD significantly according to the changes in some of the clinical scores and the EA and NA parameters of DFA at week 20 compared with week 0. No side effects were observed in laboratory tests. The results indicate that SZL might delay the development of BPSD in AD patients and thus is a potentially suitable drug for long-term use.  
24959143	Immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease: past, present and future.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140610 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 5 million people in the US alone. This neurological disorder is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration throughout the association cortex and limbic system caused by deposition of AÎ² resulting in the formation of plaques and tau resulting in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Active immunization for AÎ² showed promise in animal models of AD; however, the models were unable to predict the off-target immune effects in human patients. A few patients in the initial trial suffered cerebral meningoencephalitis. Recently, passive immunization has shown promise in the lab with less chance of off-target immune effects. Several trials have attempted using passive immunization for AÎ², but again, positive end points have been elusive. The next generation of immunotherapy for AD may involve the marriage of anti-AÎ² antibodies with technology aimed at improving transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Receptor mediated transport of antibodies may increase CNS exposure and improve the therapeutic index in the clinic.  
24959112	Adapting the Quebecois method for assessing implementation to the French National Alzheimer Plan 2008-2012: lessons for gerontological services integration.
Int J Integr Care 20140616 2014Apr
Many countries face ageing-related demographic and epidemiological challenges, notably neurodegenerative disorders, due to the multiple care services they require, thereby pleading for a more integrated system of care. The integrated Quebecois method issued from the Programme of Research to Integrate Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy inspired a French pilot experiment and the National Alzheimer Plan 2008-2012. Programme of Research to Integrate Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy method implementation was rated with an evaluation grid adapted to assess its successive degrees of completion. The approaching end of the president's term led to the method's institutionalization (2011-2012), before the implementation study ended. When the government changed, the study was interrupted. The results extracted from that 'lost' study (presented herein) have, nonetheless, 'found' some key lessons. It was possible to implement a Quebecois integrated-care method in France. We describe the lessons and pitfalls encountered in adapting this evaluation tool. This process is necessarily multidisciplinary and requires a test phase. A simple tool for quantitative assessment of integration was obtained. The first assessment of the tool was unsatisfactory but requires further studies. In the meantime, we recommend using mixed methodologies to assess the services integration level. 
24959311	Practical detection of a definitive biomarker panel for Alzheimer's disease; comparisons between matched plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.
Int J Mol Epidemiol Genet 20140529 2014
Previous mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has allowed the identification of a panel of molecular markers that are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The panel comprises Amyloid beta, Apolipoprotein E, Fibrinogen alpha chain precursor, Keratin type I cytoskeletal 9, Serum albumin precursor, SPARC-like 1 protein and Tetranectin. Here we report the development and implementation of immunoassays to measure the abundance and diagnostic capacity of these putative biomarkers in matched lumbar CSF and blood plasma samples taken in life from individuals confirmed at post-mortem as suffering from AD (n = 10) and from screened 'cognitively healthy' subjects (n = 18). The inflammatory components of Alzheimer's disease were also investigated. Employment of supervised learning techniques permitted examination of the interrelated expression patterns of the putative biomarkers and identified inflammatory components, resulting in biomarker panels with a diagnostic accuracy of 87.5% and 86.7% for the plasma and CSF datasets respectively. This is extremely important as it offers an ideal high-throughput and relatively inexpensive population screening approach. It appears possible to determine the presence or absence of AD based on our biomarker panel and it seems likely that a cheap and rapid blood test for AD is feasible.  
24958390	1H NMR Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid from Alzheimer's Disease Patients: An Example of a Possible Misinterpretation Due to Non-Adjustment of pH.
Metabolites 20140219 2014
Two publications from the same research group reporting on the detection of new possible biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), based on the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid samples (CSF) with 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), are at the origin of the present study. The authors observed significant differences in 1H NMR spectra of CSF from AD patients and healthy controls and, thus, proposed some NMR signals (without attribution) as possible biomarkers. However, this work was carried out in non-standardized pH conditions. Our study aims at warning about a possible misinterpretation that can arise from 1H NMR analyses of CSF samples if pH adjustment is not done before NMR analysis. Indeed, CSF pH increases rapidly after removal and is subject to changes over conservation time. We first identify the NMR signals described by the authors as biomarkers. We then focus on the chemical shift variations of their NMR signals as a function of pH in both standard solutions and CSF samples. Finally, a principal component analysis of 1H NMR data demonstrates that the same CSF samples recorded at pH 8.1 and 10.0 are statistically differentiated.  
23236200	Cerebral blood flow is diminished in asymptomatic middle-aged adults with maternal history of Alzheimer's disease.
Cereb. Cortex 20121212 2014Apr
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) provides an indication of the metabolic status of the cortex and may have utility in elucidating preclinical brain changes in persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related diseases. In this study, we investigated CBF in 327 well-characterized adults including patients with AD (n = 28), patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 23), older cognitively normal (OCN, n = 24) adults, and asymptomatic middle-aged adults (n = 252) with and without a family history (FH) of AD. Compared with the asymptomatic cohort, AD patients displayed significant hypoperfusion in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, lateral parietal cortex, and the hippocampal region. Patients with aMCI exhibited a similar but less marked pattern of hypoperfusion. Perfusion deficits within the OCN adults were primarily localized to the inferior parietal lobules. Asymptomatic participants with a maternal FH of AD showed hypoperfusion in hippocampal and parietofrontal regions compared with those without a FH of AD or those with only a paternal FH of AD. These observations persisted when gray matter volume was included as a voxel-wise covariate. Our findings suggest that having a mother with AD might confer a particular risk for AD-related cerebral hypoperfusion in midlife. In addition, they provide further support for the potential utility of arterial spin labeling for the measurement of AD-related neurometabolic dysfunction, particularly in situations where [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose imaging is infeasible or clinically contraindicated.  
24727880	Automated 3D segmentation of hippocampus based on active appearance model of brain MR images for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
Minerva Med.  2014Apr
To investigate the hippocampal regional deformation modes by means of a novel method of automatic segmentation for discriminating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal aging; and to further provide the effective evidence for the early diagnosis of AD. Twenty AD patients and sixty healthy volunteers were included in this retrospective study. High-resolution structural volumetric images were obtained on a 3.0 T MR imaging system. Data were processed to create three-dimensional (3D) active appearance model (AAM) of hippocampus. Automatic recognition and 3D segmentation were carried out on both sides of the hippocampus in brain MR images of individuals with this model, and the hippocampal statistical shape model was established for AD group and control group. Student's t test was used to identify whether there was difference between AD group and control group in the hippocampal regional deformation detected by automatic segmentation, and to compare whether there was difference between the automated segmentation and the manual tracing for quantifying hippocampal volumes on left/right side of the same sex group of healthy volunteers and if there was genderwise difference. Pearson's Correlation test was employed to determine whether there was a correlation between automated segmentation and manual tracing for quantifying hippocampal volumes. No significant difference was detected between automated segmentation and manual tracing for quantifying hippocampal volumes on left/right side of the same sex group of healthy volunteers (P&gt;0.05). Further there was no significant genderwise difference (P&gt;0.05). A very strong positive correlation existed between both methods for quantifying hippocampal volumes (denoted R(2) near 1.0, P&lt;0.001). Noticeable atrophy of bilateral hippocampal head was found among twenty patients with AD through statistical shape model compared with control group (P&lt;0.05), especially on the left where inward-deformation was significantly found. This novel method of automated segmentation of the hippocampus based on AAM has been found to be reliable and accurate in our study, which may be an alternative to manual segmentation. The featured atrophy of hippocampal head can be regarded as an important biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD. 
24743338	Connecting the dots: potential of data integration to identify regulatory SNPs in late-onset Alzheimer's disease GWAS findings.
PLoS ONE 20140417 2014
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a multifactorial disorder with over twenty loci associated with disease risk. Given the number of genome-wide significant variants that fall outside of coding regions, it is possible that some of these variants alter some function of gene expression rather than tagging coding variants that alter protein structure and/or function. RegulomeDB is a database that annotates regulatory functions of genetic variants. In this study, we utilized RegulomeDB to investigate potential regulatory functions of lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in five genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of risk and age-at onset (AAO) of LOAD, as well as SNPs in LD (r2â‰¥0.80) with the lead GWAS SNPs. Of a total 614 SNPs examined, 394 returned RegulomeDB scores of 1-6. Of those 394 variants, 34 showed strong evidence of regulatory function (RegulomeDB score &lt;3), and only 3 of them were genome-wide significant SNPs (ZCWPW1/rs1476679, CLU/rs1532278 and ABCA7/rs3764650). This study further supports the assumption that some of the non-coding GWAS SNPs are true associations rather than tagged associations and demonstrates the application of RegulomeDB to GWAS data.  
24496070	Proteomic analysis of serum proteins in triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice: implications for identifying biomarkers for use to screen potential candidate therapeutic drugs for early Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers of early AD. This study aims to search for potential early protein biomarkers in serum from a triple transgenic (PS1M146V/APPSwe/TauP301L) mouse model. Proteomic analysis via two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis was performed on serum samples from wild-type (WT) and triple transgenic mice that were treated with or without coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (800 mg/kg body weight/day), a powerful endogenous antioxidant displaying therapeutic benefits against AD pathology and cognitive impairment in multiple AD mouse models, for a period of three months beginning at two months of age. A total of 15 differentially expressed serum proteins were identified between the WT and AD transgenic mice. The administration of CoQ10 was found to alter the changes in the differentially expressed serum proteins by upregulating 10 proteins and down-regulating 10 proteins. Among the proteins modulated by CoQ10, clusterin and Î±-2-macroglobulin were validated via ELISA assay. These findings revealed significant changes in serum proteins in the AD mouse model at an early pathological stage and demonstrated that administration of CoQ10 could modulate these changes in serum proteins. Our study suggested that these differentially expressed serum proteins could serve as potential protein biomarkers of early AD and that screening for potential candidate AD therapeutic drugs and monitoring of therapeutic effects could be performed via measurement of the changes in these differentially expressed serum proteins.  
24496072	Effects of centrally acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on functional decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Centrally acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (CACE-Is) are associated with reduced rates of cognitive decline in patients with dementia. CACE-Is may also improve exercise tolerance in functionally impaired older adults with normal cognition, suggesting that CACE-Is may positively influence activities of daily living (ADL) in dementia. To compare rates of decline in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) receiving CACE-Is to those not currently treated with CACE-Is (NoCACE-I), included in the Doxycycline and Rifampicin for Alzheimer's Disease study (n = 406). Patients were included if baseline and end-point (twelve months apart) scores were available for measures including the Standardized Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale; Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment screen; Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB), and Lawton-Brody ADL Scale. There was a significant, 25% difference (median one-point) in the 12-month rate of decline in ADL scores in patients taking CACE-Is (n = 91), compared to the NoCACE-I group (n = 274), p = 0.024. This remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, education, and blood pressure, p = 0.034. When individual CACE-Is were compared to the NoCACE-I group, a significant reduction in the rate of decline in ADLs (median one versus four points), were only observed for perindopril, p = 0.01. The CDR-SB was also reduced (median one-point) for the perindopril compared to the NoCACE-I group, p = 0.04. This observational study suggests that CACE-Is, and potentially perindopril in particular, are associated with a reduced rate of functional decline in patients with AD, without an association with mood or behavior. This suggests that CACE-Is may slow disease progression in AD. 
24496073	Oxidative stress, testosterone, and cognition among Caucasian and Mexican-American men with and without Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The use of testosterone among aging men has been increasing, but results from studies addressing the effectiveness of testosterone replacement therapy have been equivocal. Given our prior pre-clinical studies that reported a major influence of oxidative stress on testosterone's neuroprotective effects, we investigated whether the negative effects of testosterone on brain function were predicted by oxidative load. In order to test our hypothesis, we determined whether circulating total testosterone and luteinizing hormone correlated with cognition in a subset of the Texas Alzheimer's Research &amp; Care Consortium (TARCC) cohort, consisting of Caucasian (n = 116) and Mexican-American (n = 117) men. We also assessed whether oxidative stress (as indexed by homocysteine levels) modified this relationship between sex hormones and cognition, and whether the levels of two antioxidants, superoxide dismutase-1 and glutathione S-transferase (GST), varied as a function of circulating testosterone. In a low oxidative stress environment, testosterone was positively associated with the level of the antioxidant, GST, while no deleterious effects on cognitive function were noted. In contrast, under conditions of high oxidative stress (homocysteine levels &gt;12 Î¼mol/L), testosterone and luteinizing hormone were associated with cognitive impairment, but only among Caucasians. The ethnic difference was attributed to significantly higher GST levels among Mexican-Americans. While testosterone may be beneficial under conditions of low oxidative stress, testosterone appears to have negative consequences under conditions of elevated oxidative stress, but only in Caucasians. Mexican-Americans, however, were protected from any deleterious effects of testosterone, potentially due to higher levels of endogenous antioxidant defenses such as GST. 
24496074	Altered expression of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The endocannabinoid system has gained much attention as a new potential pharmacotherapeutic target in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association between CB1 alterations and the development of AD neuropathology is unclear and often contradictory. In this study, brain CB1 mRNA and CB1 protein levels were analyzed in 3 Ã— Tg-AD mice and compared to wild-type littermates at 2, 6 and 12 months of age, using in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Semiquantitative analysis of CB1 expression focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), prelimbic cortex, dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala complex (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (VH), all areas with high CB1 densities that are strongly affected by neuropathology in 3 Ã— Tg-AD mice. At 2 months of age, there was no change in CB1 mRNA and protein levels in 3 Ã— Tg-AD mice compared to Non-Tg mice in all brain areas analyzed. However, at 6 and 12 months of age, CB1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in PFC, DH, and BLA, and lower in VH in 3 Ã— Tg-AD mice compared to wild-type littermates. CB1 immunohistochemistry revealed that CB1 protein expression was unchanged in 3 Ã— Tg-AD at 2 and 6 months of age, while a significant decrease in CB1 receptor immunoreactivity was detected in the BLA and DH of 12-month-old 3 Ã— Tg-AD mice, with no sign of alteration in other brain areas. The altered CB1 levels appear, rather, to be age-and/or pathology-dependent, indicating an involvement of the endocannabinoid system in AD pathology and supporting the ECS as a potential novel therapeutic target for treatment of AD.  
24496077	The emerging role of glutathione in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
With millions of older individuals presently suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide, AD is an unduly common form of dementia that exacts a heavy toll on affected individuals and their families. One of the emerging causative factors associated with AD pathology is oxidative stress. This AD-related increase in oxidative stress has been attributed to decreased levels of the brain antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). In this article, we review the role of GSH in AD from a pathological as well as a diagnostic point of view. We recapitulate the literature that has assessed the role of GSH in AD onset and progression. We discuss the various methodologies through which alterations in GSH levels might be monitored, and highlight the yet uncharted potential of assaying GSH levels in vivo with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in AD therapeutics and prognostics. Finally, the present manuscript integrates findings from various studies to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms through which disruptions in GSH homeostasis may contribute to AD pathology.  
24503613	Prognostic polypeptide blood plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease progression.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have varying risks of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). To test the utility of the relative abundances of blood plasma polypeptides for predicting the risk of AD progression. 119 blood plasma samples of patients with MCI with different outcomes (stable MCI and progressive MCI) were analyzed by untargeted, label-free shotgun proteomics. Predictive biomarkers of progressive MCI were selected by multivariate analysis, followed by cross-validation of the predictive model. The best model demonstrated the accuracy of ca. 79% in predicting progressive MCI. Sex differences of the predictive biomarkers were also assessed. We have identified some sex-specific protein biomarkers, e.g., alpha-2-macrogloblin (A2M), which strongly correlates with female AD progression but not with males. Significant sex bias in AD-specific biomarkers underscores the necessity of selecting sex-balanced cohort in AD biomarker studies, or using sex-specific models. Blood protein biomarkers are found to be promising for predicting AD progression in clinical settings. 
24503617	A new paradigm for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: targeting vascular activation.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
No disease-modifying therapies are currently available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 36 million people worldwide. Although cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes are increasingly implicated as contributing to the development of AD, the mechanisms whereby these factors influence pathological processes in the AD brain have not been defined. Here we propose, for the first time, vascular activation as a relevant mechanism in AD pathogenesis. We explore this hypothesis in two transgenic AD animal models: AD2576APPSwe (AD2576) and LaFerla 3xTg (3xTgAD) mice using the vascular activation inhibitor sunitinib. Our data show that in both AD animal models, the cerebrovasculature is activated and overexpresses amyloid beta, thrombin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and matrix metalloproteinase 9. Oral administration of sunitinib significantly reduces vascular expression of these proteins. Furthermore, sunitinib improves cognitive function, as assessed by several behavioral paradigms, in both AD animal models. Finally, oxidant injury of brain endothelial cells in culture, resulting in expression of inflammatory proteins, is mitigated by sunitinib. The current data, as well as published studies showing cerebrovascular activation in human AD, support further exploration of vascular-based mechanisms in AD pathogenesis. New thinking about AD pathogenesis and novel, effective treatments are urgently needed. Identification of "vascular activation" as a heretofore unexplored target could stimulate translational investigations in this newly defined area, leading to innovative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this devastating disease.  
24503620	Posttranslational nitro-glycative modifications of albumin in Alzheimer's disease: implications in cytotoxicity and amyloid-Î² peptide aggregation.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Glycation and nitrotyrosination are pathological posttranslational modifications that make proteins prone to losing their physiological properties. Since both modifications are increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) accumulation, we have studied their effect on albumin, the most abundant protein in cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Brain and plasmatic levels of glycated and nitrated albumin were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. In vitro turbidometry and electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that glycation and nitrotyrosination promote changes in albumin structure and biochemical properties. Glycated albumin was more resistant to proteolysis and less uptake by hepatoma cells occurred. Glycated albumin also reduced the osmolarity expected for a solution containing native albumin. Both glycation and nitrotyrosination turned albumin cytotoxic in a cell type-dependent manner for cerebral and vascular cells. Finally, of particular relevance to AD, these modified albumins were significantly less effective in avoiding AÎ² aggregation than native albumin. In summary, nitrotyrosination and especially glycation alter albumin structural and biochemical properties, and these modifications might contribute for the progression of AD.  
24531161	Analysis of matrix metallo-proteases and the plasminogen system in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The expression of matrix metallo-proteases (MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9), plasminogen and their regulators (TIMP-1, tissue plasminogen activator and neuroserpin) was investigated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) subjects, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. ELISA analysis revealed a significant increase in MMP-3 protein levels in CSF from AD subjects, compared to age-matched SCI and MCI cases. No significant differences in MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels were detected between the three groups. MMP-7 was undetectable in all three groups. MCI individuals exhibited increased levels of the metallo-protease inhibitor TIMP-1 in CSF as well as higher plasminogen and neuroserpin expression, compared to SCI subjects. Levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were significantly reduced in AD CSF. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive association between MMP-3, p-tau, and total-tau levels. Conversely, there was a significant negative correlation between this protease and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. tPA positively correlated with amyloid-Î² levels in CSF and with MMSE scores. Our results suggest that MMP-3 and tPA, in combination with current amyloid-Î² and tau biomarkers, may have potential as surrogate indicators of an ongoing AD pathology.  
24577458	Do cholinesterase inhibitors act primarily on attention deficit? A naturalistic study in Alzheimer's disease patients.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Attention is the first non-memory domain affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), before deficits in language and visuo-spatial function, and it is claimed that attention deficits are responsible for the difficulties with daily living in early demented patients. The aim of this longitudinal study in a group of 121 Caucasian, community-dwelling, mild-to-moderate AD patients (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &gt;17) was to detect which cognitive domains were most affected by the disease and whether one year treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors was more effective in preserving attention than memory. All subjects were evaluated by a neuropsychological battery including global measurements (MMSE, Information-Memory-Concentration Test) and tasks exploring verbal long-term memory, language, attention, and executive functions. The comparison between two evaluations, made 12 months apart, shows statistically significant differences, indicating deterioration compared to baseline, in the following tests: MMSE (with no gender differences), Composite Memory Score, Short Story Delayed Recall, Trail-Making Test A, Semantic Fluency Test, and Token Test. Conversely, there were no differences in the two evaluations of the Digit Span, Corsi Tapping Test, Short Story Immediate Recall, and Phonemic Fluency Tests. It appears that the treatment specifically attenuated the decline in tests assessing attention and executive functions. A stabilization of the ability to pay attention, with the ensuing positive effects on executive functions, recent memory, and information acquisition which depend on attention, appears to be the main neuropsychological mechanism through which the activation of the cholinergic system, resulting from cholinesterase inhibition, exerts its effect on cognition.  
24642166	Kinetic and structural analysis of the irreversible inhibition of human monoamine oxidases by ASS234, a multi-target compound designed for use in Alzheimer's disease.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20140316 2014Jun
Monoamine oxidases (MAO) and cholinesterases are validated targets in the design of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The multi-target compound N-((5-(3-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)propoxy)-1-methyl-1H-indol-2-yl)methyl)-N-methylprop-2-yn-1-amine (ASS234), bearing the MAO-inhibiting propargyl group attached to a donepezil moiety that inhibits cholinesterases, retained activity against human acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterases. The inhibition of MAO A and MAO B by ASS234 was characterized and compared to other known MAO inhibitors. ASS234 was almost as effective as clorgyline (kinact/KI=3Ã—10(6) min(-1)M(-1)) and was shown by structural studies to form the same N5 covalent adduct with the FAD cofactor.  
24656833	Parahippocampal white matter volume predicts Alzheimer's disease risk in cognitively normal old adults.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140218 2014Aug
An inÂ vivo marker of the underlying pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is atrophy in select brain regions detected with quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although gray matter changes have been documented to be predictive of cognitive decline culminating in AD among healthy older adults, very little attention has been given to alterations in white matter as a possible MRI biomarker predictive of AD. In this investigation, we examined parahippocampal white matter (PWM) volume derived from baseline MRI scans in 2 independent samples of 65 cognitively normal older adults, followed longitudinally, to determine if it was predictive of AD risk. The average follow-up period for the 2 samples was 8.5Â years. Comparisons between the stable participants (NÂ = 50) and those who declined to AD (NÂ = 15) over time revealed a significant difference in baseline PWM volume (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, baseline PWM volume was predictive not only of time to AD (hazard ratioÂ = 3.1, p &lt; 0.05), but also of baseline episodic memory performance (pÂ = 0.041). These results demonstrate that PWM atrophy provides a sensitive MRI biomarker of AD dementia risk among those with normal cognitive function.  
24531156	1H-proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy differentiates dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
FDG-PET and SPECT studies suggest that hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in occipital lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) are prominent features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. Cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism are tightly linked to brain energy metabolism. 1H-MRS is a useful tool to directly detect energy metabolism. We aimed to use 1H-MRS to characterize metabolite concentrations in the occipital lobe and PCG in DLB and AD patients, and estimate their usefulness in the diagnosis of DLB. Nineteen DLB, 21 AD, and 18 normal control (NC) subjects underwent 1H-MRS with the voxels placed in bilateral occipital lobes and left PCG. The N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate (Glu) concentrations in occipital lobe in DLB were lower than those in AD and NC. Concentrations of these two metabolites in PCG in DLB were lower than those in NC, and were the same as those in AD. These results remained robust after correcting for relative gray matter volume in the region of interest. The NAA and Glu concentrations in occipital lobe in DLB were found correlated with global cognitive function. From the ROC curves with Glu concentrations in occipital lobe, the mean areas under the curve were 0.845 for the DLB/control (with sensitivity 83.3% and specificity 84.2%) and 0.773 for the DLB/AD (with sensitivity 66.7% and specificity 84.2%). Our study suggests that 1H-MRS investigation is valuable to detect the characteristic patterns of metabolite concentrations and is helpful in the diagnostic process and assessing dementia severity in DLB.  
24531157	Shape analysis of the corpus callosum in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration subtypes.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Morphology of the corpus callosum is a useful biomarker of neuronal loss, as different patterns of cortical atrophy help to distinguish between dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). We used a sophisticated morphometric analysis of the corpus callosum in FTLD subtypes including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), semantic dementia (SD), and progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), and compared them to AD patients and 27 matched controls. FTLD patient subgroups diverged in their callosal morphology profiles, with FTD patients showing marked widespread differences, PNFA patients with differences largely in the anterior half of the callosum, and SD patients differences in a small segment of the genu. AD patients showed differences in predominantly posterior callosal regions. This study is consistent with our previous findings showing significant cortical and subcortical regional atrophy across FTLD subtypes, and suggests that callosal atrophy patterns differentiate AD from FTLD, and FTLD subtypes.  
24577455	The Italian Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (I-ADNI): validation of structural MR imaging.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The North American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (NA-ADNI) was the first program to develop standardized procedures for Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging biomarker collection. OBJECTIve: We describe the validation of acquisition and processing of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in different Italian academic AD clinics following NA-ADNI procedures. 373 patients with subjective memory impairment (n = 12), mild cognitive impairment (n = 92), Alzheimer's dementia (n = 253), and frontotemporal dementia (n = 16) were enrolled in 9 Italian centers. 22 cognitively healthy elderly controls were also included. MRI site qualification and MP-RAGE quality assessment was applied following the NA-ADNI procedures. Indices of validity were: (i) NA-ADNI phantom's signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio, (ii) proportion of images passing quality control, (iii) comparability of automated intracranial volume (ICV) estimates across scanners, and (iv) known-group validity of manual hippocampal volumetry. Results on Phantom and Volunteers scans showed that I-ADNI acquisition parameters were comparable with those one of the ranked-A ADNI scans. Eighty-seven percent of I-ADNI MPRAGE images were ranked of high quality in comparison of 69% of NA-ADNI. ICV showed homogeneous variances across scanners except for Siemens scanners at 3.0 Tesla (p = 0.039). A significant difference in hippocampal volume was found between AD and controls on 1.5 Tesla scans (p &lt; 0.001), confirming known group validity test. This study has provided standardization of MRI acquisition and imaging marker collection across different Italian clinical units and equipment. This is a mandatory step to the implementation of imaging biomarkers in clinical routine for early and differential diagnosis. 
24577456	Genome-wide serum microRNA expression profiling identifies serum biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Recent findings that human serum contains stably expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) have revealed a great potential of serum miRNA signature as disease fingerprints to diagnosis. Here we used genome-wide serum miRNA expression analysis to investigate the value of serum miRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing followed by individual quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays was used to test the difference in levels of serum miRNAs between 50 AD patients and 50 controls in the screening stages. The detected serum miRNAs then were validated by qRT-PCR in 158 patients and 155 controls. MiR-98-5p, miR-885-5p, miR-483-3p, miR-342-3p, miR-191-5p, and miR-let-7d-5p displayed significantly different expression levels in AD patients compared with controls. Among the 6 miRNAs, miR-342-3p has the best sensitivity (81.5%) and specificity (70.1%) and was correlated to Mini-Mental State Examination score. This study identified six serum miRNAs that distinguish AD patients from healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity. Serum miRNA panel (or miR-342-3p alone) may serve as a novel, noninvasive biomarker for AD.  
24577461	The impact of APOE status on relationship of biomarkers of vascular risk and systemic inflammation to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Research on the link between APOEÎµ4 and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been inconsistent. Previous work has shown a relationship between serum biomarkers of vascular risk and inflammation and NPS in AD. The current study investigated the impact of APOEÎµ4 status on the relationship between biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, systemic inflammation, and NPS. The sample was drawn from the TARCC Longitudinal Research Cohort; the final sample of 190 consisted of 124 females and 66 males meeting the diagnostic criteria for mild to moderate AD. 115 individuals were APOEÎµ4 carriers and 75 were non-carriers. Serum-based clinical biomarkers of vascular risk and biomarkers of inflammation related to AD were analyzed. NPS data was gathered from caretakers/family members using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. The significant biomarkers differed for carriers and non-carriers with IL15 being a negative biomarker of total NPS accounting for 12% of the variance for carriers and IL18 and TNFÎ± negative predictors for non-carriers (18% of variance). Patterns related to specific symptoms were similar. Stratification by gender revealed significant biomarkers of total NPS for female carriers were negative IL15 and IL1ra (18% of variance) and for female non-carriers were negative IL18 and positive homocysteine. Total cholesterol was a positive biomarker of total NPS for both male carriers (36% of variance) and non-carriers (negative TNFÎ± and total cholesterol, 32% of variance). These findings suggest that dysregulation of inflammatory activity is related to NPS, that cholesterol is a significant factor in the occurrence of NPS, and that gender and APOE status need to be considered.  
24577467	Choroidal thinning as a new finding in Alzheimer's disease: evidence from enhanced depth imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The involvement of retina and its vasculature has been recently described in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, none of the previous works have yet investigated the choroid in vivo. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and enhanced depth imaging (EDI) technique is non-invasively used to assess choroidal thickness in patients with AD and to determine whether the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and central retinal thickness are reduced compared to normal subjects. Forty-two eyes of 21 patients (mean age, 73.1 Â± 6.9 years) with a diagnosis of mild to moderate AD and 42 eyes of 21 age-matched control subjects (mean age, 70.3 Â± 7.3 years) were included in this prospective, cross-sectional study. All the subjects underwent neuropsychological (MMSE, ADAS-Cog, and CDR) and ophthalmological evaluation. The SD-OCT images of the choroid were obtained by EDI modality. Choroidal thickness was assessed by manual measurement. The following parameters, measured automatically by the OCT software, were also analyzed for each eye: 1-mm central subfield (CSF) retinal thickness, peripapillary RNFL thickness. Choroidal thickness was significantly thinner in AD than in control eyes (p &lt; 0.05). No difference in CSF retinal thickness was found between groups (p &gt; 0.05). Mean peripapillary RNFL thickness in all four quadrants was similar between groups (p &gt; 0.05). OCT measurements were not correlated with any of the tested psychometric parameters (p &gt; 0.05). Compared with healthy subjects, patients with AD showed a significant reduction in choroidal thickness. Choroidal thinning may represent an adjunctive biomarker for the diagnosis and follow-up of this disease. 
24577474	Chronic aluminum intake causes Alzheimer's disease: applying Sir Austin Bradford Hill's causality criteria.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Industrialized societies produce many convenience foods with aluminum additives that enhance various food properties and use alum (aluminum sulfate or aluminum potassium sulfate) in water treatment to enable delivery of large volumes of drinking water to millions of urban consumers. The present causality analysis evaluates the extent to which the routine, life-long intake, and metabolism of aluminum compounds can account for Alzheimer's disease (AD), using Austin Bradford Hill's nine epidemiological and experimental causality criteria, including strength of the relationship, consistency, specificity, temporality, dose-dependent response, biological rationale, coherence with existing knowledge, experimental evidence, and analogy. Mechanisms that underlie the risk of low concentrations of aluminum relate to (1) aluminum's absorption rates, allowing the impression that aluminum is safe to ingest and as an additive in food and drinking water treatment, (2) aluminum's slow progressive uptake into the brain over a long prodromal phase, and (3) aluminum's similarity to iron, in terms of ionic size, allows aluminum to use iron-evolved mechanisms to enter the highly-active, iron-dependent cells responsible for memory processing. Aluminum particularly accumulates in these iron-dependent cells to toxic levels, dysregulating iron homeostasis and causing microtubule depletion, eventually producing changes that result in disconnection of neuronal afferents and efferents, loss of function and regional atrophy consistent with MRI findings in AD brains. AD is a human form of chronic aluminum neurotoxicity. The causality analysis demonstrates that chronic aluminum intake causes AD.  
24577477	Influence of anesthetics on Alzheimer's disease: biophysical, animal model, and clinical reports.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Since the finding in the 1880 s that elderly patients may experience cognitive decline following surgery, the search for an understanding of this phenomenon has been underway. In the last decade, evidence from biophysical (light scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance), in vitro, in vivo animal studies, retrospective evaluations of human registries, and recently prospective randomized trials have explored the idea that various anesthetic agents play a role in this phenomenon by interacting with the biochemical mechanisms that are also responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease. In the current review, we examine the evidence available and conclude that there is significant evidence to suggest an important role for this mechanism.  
24079767	Antioxidant clinical trials in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease - challenges and perspectives.
Curr. Pharm. Des.  2014
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder representing the most common form of dementia and the most feared highly disabling age-related condition of our time. Hallmarks of AD include a dramatically increasing number of cases due to prospected demographics and the absence of a cure. AD is incurable as it escapes the formula "one disease, one mechanism, one drug". AD has a multifaceted pathophysiology only in part uncovered. Even the proven chronological primacy of free radical-related damage in AD-related neurodegeneration has not yield successful oxidative stress - lowering trial designs. As a consequence, clinical trials of antioxidants in AD have brought largely negative conclusions. The aims of this review are to discuss 1. rationale for antioxidant trials, 2. reasons for failure of antioxidants in AD therapy, 3. potential preventive benefits of natural nutrition against AD onset and 4. the enormous relevance of detecting and treating AD risk factors as long as possible prior to AD manifestation.  
24668497	The earlier the better: Alzheimer's prevention, early detection, and the quest for pharmacological interventions.
Cult Med Psychiatry  2014Jun
Although the risk factors, biomarkers, and medications for Alzheimer's disease appear to be almost identical in 1993 and 2013, profound changes can de detected throughout this time period. This article maps these recent changes in the conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease, especially the emerging trend toward prevention. While some preventive practices (e.g., brain training) and the search for early signs and biomarkers (such as APOEÎµ4) have existed for a long time, the recent broadening of scope to include cardiovascular risk factors and their prevention, paired with pre-symptomatic detection of disease-specific biomarkers, has considerably impacted the conventional understanding of this syndrome and the possibilities for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The rationale for emphasizing multiple logics when explaining these changes is to avoid simplified argumentative pathways that exist among some scientists.  
23752245	Rare autosomal copy number variations in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Psychiatry 20130611 2014Jun
Over 200 rare and fully penetrant pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2) cause a subset of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EO-FAD). Of these, 21 cases of EO-FAD families carrying unique APP locus duplications remain the only pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) identified to date in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using high-density DNA microarrays, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide analysis for the presence of rare CNVs in 261 EO-FAD and early/mixed-onset pedigrees. Our analysis revealed 10 novel private CNVs in 10 EO-FAD families overlapping a set of genes that includes: A2BP1, ABAT, CDH2, CRMP1, DMRT1, EPHA5, EPHA6, ERMP1, EVC, EVC2, FLJ35024 and VLDLR. In addition, CNVs encompassing two known frontotemporal dementia genes, CHMP2B and MAPT were found. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting rare gene-rich CNVs in EO-FAD and early/mixed-onset AD that are likely to underlie pathogenicity in familial AD and perhaps related dementias.  
24470773	Clinical epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease: assessing sex and gender differences.
Clin Epidemiol 20140108 2014
With the aging of the population, the burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly expanding. More than 5 million people in the US alone are affected with AD and this number is expected to triple by 2050. While men may have a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia, women are disproportionally affected with AD. One explanation is that men may die of competing causes of death earlier in life, so that only the most resilient men may survive to older ages. However, many other factors should also be considered to explain the sex differences. In this review, we discuss the differences observed in men versus women in the incidence and prevalence of MCI and AD, in the structure and function of the brain, and in the sex-specific and gender-specific risk and protective factors for AD. In medical research, sex refers to biological differences such as chromosomal differences (eg, XX versus XY chromosomes), gonadal differences, or hormonal differences. In contrast, gender refers to psychosocial and cultural differences between men and women (eg, access to education and occupation). Both factors play an important role in the development and progression of diseases, including AD. Understanding both sex- and gender-specific risk and protective factors for AD is critical for developing individualized interventions for the prevention and treatment of AD.  
24478719	Cerebral hemodynamics of the aging brain: risk of Alzheimer disease and benefit of aerobic exercise.
Front Physiol 20140121 2014
Alzheimer disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease often coexist with advanced age. Mounting evidence indicates that the presence of vascular disease and its risk factors increase the risk of AD, suggesting a potential overlap of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. In particular, atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and stiffening of central elastic arteries have been shown to associate with AD. Currently, there are no effective treatments for the cure and prevention of AD. Vascular risk factors are modifiable via either pharmacological or lifestyle intervention. In this regard, habitual aerobic exercise is increasingly recognized for its benefits on brain structure and cognitive function. Considering the well-established benefits of regular aerobic exercise on vascular health, exercise-related improvements in brain structure and cognitive function may be mediated by vascular adaptations. In this review, we will present the current evidence for the physiological mechanisms by which vascular health alters the structural and functional integrity of the aging brain and how improvements in vascular health, via regular aerobic exercise, potentially benefits cognitive function.  
24511233	Activation of M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat 20140128 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are neurological disorders with overlapping symptomatology, including both cognitive deficits and behavioral disturbances. Current clinical treatments for both disorders have limited efficacy accompanied by dose-limiting side effects, and ultimately fail to adequately address the broad range of symptoms observed. Novel therapeutic options for AD and SZ are needed to better manage the spectrum of symptoms with reduced adverse-effect liability. Substantial evidence suggests that activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) has the potential to treat both cognitive and psychosis-related symptoms associated with numerous central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, use of nonselective modulators of mAChRs is hampered by dose-limiting peripheral side effects that limit their clinical utility. In order to maintain the clinical efficacy without the adverse-effect liability, efforts have been focused on the discovery of compounds that selectively modulate the centrally located M1 and M4 mAChR subtypes. Previous drug discovery attempts have been thwarted by the highly conserved nature of the acetylcholine site across mAChR subtypes. However, current efforts by our laboratory and others have now focused on modulators that bind to allosteric sites on mAChRs, allowing these compounds to display unprecedented subtype selectivity. Over the past couple of decades, the discovery of small molecules capable of selectively targeting the M1 or M4 mAChR subtypes has allowed researchers to elucidate the roles of these receptors in regulating cognitive and behavioral disturbances in preclinical animal models. Here, we provide an overview of these promising preclinical and clinical studies, which suggest that M1- and M4-selective modulators represent viable novel targets with the potential to successfully address a broad range of symptoms observed in patients with AD and SZ.  
24550846	Biological basis for cerebral dysfunction in schizophrenia in contrast with Alzheimer's disease.
Front Psychiatry 20140203 2013
Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease are two disorders that, while conceptualized as pathophysiologically and clinically distinct, cause substantial cognitive and behavioral impairment worldwide, and target apparently similar - or nearby - circuitry in regions such as the temporal and frontal lobes. We review the salient differences and similarities from selected historical, nosological, and putative mechanistic viewpoints, as a means to help both clinicians and researchers gain a better insight into these intriguing disorders, for which over a century of research and decades of translational development was needed to begin yielding treatments that are objectively effective, but still very far from entirely satisfactory. Ongoing comparison and "cross-pollination" among these approaches to disorders that produce similar deficits is likely to continue improving both our insight into the mechanisms at play, and the development of biotechnological approaches to tackle both conditions - and related disorders - more rapidly and efficaciously.  
24634659	Cannabinoids for treatment of Alzheimer's disease: moving toward the clinic.
Front Pharmacol 20140305 2014
The limited effectiveness of current therapies against Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlights the need for intensifying research efforts devoted to developing new agents for preventing or retarding the disease process. During the last few years, targeting the endogenous cannabinoid system has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer. The endocannabinoid system is composed by a number of cannabinoid receptors, including the well-characterized CB1 and CB2 receptors, with their endogenous ligands and the enzymes related to the synthesis and degradation of these endocannabinoid compounds. Several findings indicate that the activation of both CB1 and CB2 receptors by natural or synthetic agonists, at non-psychoactive doses, have beneficial effects in Alzheimer experimental models by reducing the harmful Î²-amyloid peptide action and tau phosphorylation, as well as by promoting the brain's intrinsic repair mechanisms. Moreover, endocannabinoid signaling has been demonstrated to modulate numerous concomitant pathological processes, including neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. The present paper summarizes the main experimental studies demonstrating the polyvalent properties of cannabinoid compounds for the treatment of AD, which together encourage progress toward a clinical trial.  
24639880	Huperzine a in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: a meta-analysis.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140203 2014
The objective of our study was to perform an updated meta-analysis of placebo-controlled RCTs of Huperzine A (Hup A) on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), in order to provide the basis and reference for clinical rational drug use. The primary outcome measures assessed were minimental state examination (MMSE) and activities of daily living scale (ADL). Eight AD trials with 733 participants and two VD trials with 92 participants that met our inclusion criteria were identified. The results showed that Hup A could significantly improve the MMSE and ADL score of AD and VD patients, and longer durations would result in better efficacy for the patients with AD. It seemed that there was significant improvement of cognitive function measured by memory quotient (MQ) in patients with AD. Most adverse effects in AD were generally of mild to moderate severity and transient. Compared to the patients with AD, Hup A may offer fewer side effects for participants with VD in this study. Therefore, Hup A is a well-tolerated drug that could significantly improve cognitive performance in patients with AD or VD, but we need to use it with caution in the clinical treatment.  
24639911	Emotional working memory and Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Alzheimers Dis 20140205 2014
A number of recent studies have reported that working memory does not seem to show typical age-related deficits in healthy older adults when emotional information is involved. Differently, studies about the short-term ability to encode and actively manipulate emotional information in dementia of Alzheimer's type are few and have yielded mixed results. Here, we review behavioural and neuroimaging evidence that points to a complex interaction between emotion modulation and working memory in Alzheimer's. In fact, depending on the function involved, patients may or may not show an emotional benefit in their working memory performance. In addition, this benefit is not always clearly biased (e.g., towards negative or positive information). We interpret this complex pattern of results as a consequence of the interaction between multiple factors including the severity of Alzheimer's disease, the nature of affective stimuli, and type of working memory task.  
24648738	Combotherapy and current concepts as well as future strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat 20140311 2014
It has been estimated that 35.6 million people globally had dementia in 2010 and the prevalence of dementia has been predicted to double every 20 years. Thus, 115.4 million people may be living with dementia in 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is present in 60%-70% of people with dementia. Unfortunately, there are few approved drugs that can alleviate the cognitive or behavioral symptoms of AD dementia. Recent studies have revealed that pathophysiological changes related to AD occur decades before the appearance of clinical symptoms of dementia. This extended preclinical phase of AD provides a critical chance for disease-modifying agents to halt or delay the relentless process of AD. Although several trials targeting various pathological processes are ongoing, the examination of the combined use of different approaches to combat AD seems warranted. In this article, we will review current therapies, future strategies, and ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of AD with a special focus on combination therapies. Furthermore, preventive strategies for cognitively normal subjects in the presymptomatic stages of AD will also be addressed. In this review, we discuss current hypotheses of the disease process. In the decades since the approval of cholinesterase inhibitors, no new drug has ultimately demonstrated clear success in clinical trials. Given the difficulties that have been encountered in attempts to identify a single drug that can treat AD, we must pursue effective multi-target strategies, ie, combination therapies. The combination of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine is considered well tolerated and safe, and this combination benefits patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In contrast, with the exception of adjuvant therapies of conventional drugs, combinations of different disease-modifying agents with different mechanisms may have promising synergic effects and benefit cognition, behavior, and daily living function.  
24653673	Protein phosphatase 2A dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
Front Mol Neurosci 20140311 2014
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a large family of enzymes that account for the majority of brain Ser/Thr phosphatase activity. While PP2A enzymes collectively modulate most cellular processes, sophisticated regulatory mechanisms are ultimately responsible for ensuring isoform-specific substrate specificity. Of particular interest to the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field, alterations in PP2A regulators and PP2A catalytic activity, subunit expression, methylation and/or phosphorylation, have been reported in AD-affected brain regions. "PP2A" dysfunction has been linked to tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloidogenesis and synaptic deficits that are pathological hallmarks of this neurodegenerative disorder. Deregulation of PP2A enzymes also affects the activity of many Ser/Thr protein kinases implicated in AD. This review will more specifically discuss the role of the PP2A/BÎ± holoenzyme and PP2A methylation in AD pathogenesis. The PP2A/BÎ± isoform binds to tau and is the primary tau phosphatase. Its deregulation correlates with increased tau phosphorylation in vivo and in AD. Disruption of PP2A/BÎ±-tau protein interactions likely contribute to tau deregulation in AD. Significantly, alterations in one-carbon metabolism that impair PP2A methylation are associated with increased risk for sporadic AD, and enhanced AD-like pathology in animal models. Experimental studies have linked deregulation of PP2A methylation with down-regulation of PP2A/BÎ±, enhanced phosphorylation of tau and amyloid precursor protein, tau mislocalization, microtubule destabilization and neuritic defects. While it remains unclear what are the primary events that underlie "PP2A" dysfunction in AD, deregulation of PP2A enzymes definitely affects key players in the pathogenic process. As such, there is growing interest in developing PP2A-centric therapies for AD, but this may be a daunting task without a better understanding of the regulation and function of specific PP2A enzymes.  
24484278	Myelin injury and degraded myelin vesicles in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Mar
Myelin disruption is an important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that contributes to impairment of neuronal circuitry and cognition. In this study we characterize myelin degradation in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with normal aged controls. Myelin from patients with AD (n=13) was compared to matched controls (n=6). Myelin degradation was examined by immunohistochemistry in frontal white matter (WM) for intact myelin basic protein (MBP), degraded MBP, the presence of myelin lipid and for PAS staining. The relationship of myelin degradation and axonal injury was also assessed. Brains from patients with AD had significant loss of intact MBP, and an increase in degraded MBP in periventricular WM adjacent to a denuded ependymal layer. In regions of myelin degradation, vesicles were identified that stained positive for degraded MBP, myelin lipid, and neurofilament but not for intact MBP. Most vesicles stained for PAS, a corpora amylacea marker. The vesicles were significantly more abundant in the periventricular WM of AD patients compared to controls (44.5 Â± 11.0 versus 1.7 Â± 1.1, p=0.02). In AD patients degraded MBP is associated in part with vesicles particularly in periventricular WM that is adjacent to areas of ependymal injury. 
24711794	Prevention approaches in a preclinical canine model of Alzheimer's disease: benefits and challenges.
Front Pharmacol 20140321 2014
Aged dogs spontaneously develop many features of human aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) including cognitive decline and neuropathology. In this review, we discuss age-dependent learning tasks, memory tasks, and functional measures that can be used in aged dogs for sensitive treatment outcome measures. Neuropathology that is linked to cognitive decline is described along with examples of treatment studies that show reduced neuropathology in aging dogs (dietary manipulations, behavioral enrichment, immunotherapy, and statins). Studies in canine show that multi-targeted approaches may be more beneficial than single pathway manipulations (e.g., antioxidants combined with behavioral enrichment). Aging canine studies show good predictive validity for human clinical trials outcomes (e.g., immunotherapy) and several interventions tested in dogs strongly support a prevention approach (e.g., immunotherapy and statins). Further, dogs are ideally suited for prevention studies as they the age because onset of cognitive decline and neuropathology strongly support longitudinal interventions that can be completed within a 3-5 year period. Disadvantages to using the canine model are that they lengthy, use labor-intensive comprehensive cognitive testing, and involve costly housing (almost as high as that of non-human primates). However, overall, using the dog as a preclinical model for testing preventive approaches for AD may complement work in rodents and non-human primates.  
24753653	Visuo-cognitive skill deficits in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease: A comparative analysis.
Ann Indian Acad Neurol  2014Jan
Dementia is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive loss. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the Lewy body disease are the two most common causes of age-related degenerative dementia. Visuo-cognitive skills are a combination of very different cognitive functions being performed by the visual system. These skills are impaired in both AD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The aim of this review is to evaluate various studies for these visuo-cognitive skills. An exhaustive internet search of all relevant medical databases was carried out using a series of key-word applications, including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, SportDiscus, Science Citation Index, Index to Theses, ZETOC, PEDro and occupational therapy (OT) seeker and OT search. We reviewed all the articles until March 2013 with key words of: Visual skills visual cognition dementia AD, but the direct neurobiological etiology is difficult to establish., Dementia of Lewy body disease. Although most studies have used different tests for studying these abilities, in general, these tests evaluated the individual's ability of (1) visual recognition, (2) visual discrimination, (3) visual attention and (4) visuo-perceptive integration. Performance on various tests has been evaluated for assessing these skills. Most studies assessing such skills show that these skills are impaired in DLB as compared with AD. Visuo-cognitive skills are impaired more in DLB as compared with AD. These impairments have evident neuropathological correlations, but the direct neurobiological etiology is difficult to establish.  
24619420	Î²-amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer disease are not inert when bound to copper ions but can degrade hydrogen peroxide and generate reactive oxygen species.
J. Biol. Chem. 20140311 2014Apr25
According to the "amyloid cascade" hypothesis of Alzheimer disease, the formation of AÎ² fibrils and senile plaques in the brain initiates a cascade of events leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, neurodegeneration, and the symptom of dementia. Recently, however, emphasis has shifted away from amyloid fibrils as the predominant toxic form of AÎ² toward smaller aggregates, referred to as "soluble oligomers." These oligomers have become one of the prime suspects for involvement in the early oxidative damage that is evident in this disease. This raises the question whether or not AÎ² fibrils are actually "inert tombstones" present at the end of the aggregation process. Here we show that, when AÎ²(1-42) aggregates, including fibrils, are bound to Cu(II) ions, they retain their redox activity and are able to degrade hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with the formation of hydroxyl radicals and the consequent oxidation of the peptide (detected by formation of carbonyl groups). We find that this ability increases as the Cu(II):peptide ratio increases and is accompanied by changes in aggregate morphology, as determined by atomic force microscopy. When aggregates are prepared in the copresence of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, the ratio of Cu(II):Zn(II) becomes an important factor in the degeneration of H2O2, the formation of carbonyl groups in the peptide, and in aggregate morphology. We believe, therefore, that AÎ² fibrils can destroy H2O2 and generate damaging hydroxyl radicals and, so, are not necessarily inert end points.  
24772250	Familial Alzheimer's disease modelling using induced pluripotent stem cell technology.
World J Stem Cells  2014Apr26
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in which patients exhibit gradual loss of memory that impairs their ability to learn or carry out daily tasks. Diagnosis of AD is difficult, particularly in early stages of the disease, and largely consists of cognitive assessments, with only one in four patients being correctly diagnosed. Development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AD has proved to be a lengthy, costly and relatively unproductive process with attrition rates of &gt; 90%. As a result, there are no cures for AD and few treatment options available for patients. Therefore, there is a pressing need for drug discovery platforms that can accurately and reproducibly mimic the AD phenotype and be amenable to high content screening applications. Here, we discuss the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be derived from adult cells, as a method of recapitulation of AD phenotype in vitro. We assess their potential use in high content screening assays and the barriers that exist to realising their full potential in predictive efficacy, toxicology and disease modelling. At present, a number of limitations need to be addressed before the use of iPSC technology can be fully realised in AD therapeutic applications. However, whilst the use of AD-derived iPSCs in drug discovery remains a fledgling field, it is one with immense potential that is likely to reach fruition within the next few years.  
24656904	Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in an Algerian population.
Arch. Med. Res. 20140320 2014Apr
There is growing evidence that increased blood concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study was conducted to evaluate the association of serum tHcy and other biochemical risk factors with AD. This is a case-control study including 41 individuals diagnosed with AD and 46 nondemented controls. Serum levels of all studied biochemical parameters were performed. Univariate logistic regression showed a significant increase of tHcy (p = 0.008), urea (p = 0.036) and a significant decrease of vitamin B12 (p = 0.012) in AD group vs. controls. Using multivariate logistic regression, tHcy (p = 0.007, OR = 1.376) appeared as an independent risk factor predictor of AD. There was a significant positive correlation between tHcy and creatinine (p &lt;0.0001). A negative correlation was found between tHcy and vitamin B12 (p &lt;0.0001). Our findings support that hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for AD in an Algerian population and is also associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. 
24795626	Possible modification of Alzheimer's disease by statins in midlife: interactions with genetic and non-genetic risk factors.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140423 2014
The benefits of statins, commonly prescribed for hypercholesterolemia, in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not yet been fully established. A recent randomized clinical trial did not show any therapeutic effects of two statins on cognitive function in AD. Interestingly, however, the results of the Rotterdam study, one of the largest prospective cohort studies, showed reduced risk of AD in statin users. Based on the current understanding of statin actions and AD pathogenesis, it is still worth exploring whether statins can prevent AD when administered decades before the onset of AD or from midlife. This review discusses the possible beneficial effects of statins, drawn from previous clinical observations, pathogenic mechanisms, which include Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) and tau metabolism, genetic and non-genetic risk factors (apolipoprotein E, cholesterol, sex, hypertension, and diabetes), and other clinical features (vascular dysfunction and oxidative and inflammatory stress) of AD. These findings suggest that administration of statins in midlife might prevent AD in late life by modifying genetic and non-genetic risk factors for AD. It should be clarified whether statins inhibit AÎ² accumulation, tau pathological features, and brain atrophy in humans. To answer this question, a randomized controlled study using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging would be useful. This clinical evaluation could help us to overcome this devastating disease.  
24795567	Neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A rational framework for the search of novel therapeutic approaches.
Front Cell Neurosci 20140422 2014
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in people over 60 years old. The molecular and cellular alterations that trigger this disease are still diffuse, one of the reasons for the delay in finding an effective treatment. In the search for new targets to search for novel therapeutic avenues, clinical studies in patients who used anti-inflammatory drugs indicating a lower incidence of AD have been of value to support the neuroinflammatory hypothesis of the neurodegenerative processes and the role of innate immunity in this disease. Neuroinflammation appears to occur as a consequence of a series of damage signals, including trauma, infection, oxidative agents, redox iron, oligomers of Ï„ and Î²-amyloid, etc. In this context, our theory of Neuroimmunomodulation focus on the link between neuronal damage and brain inflammatory process, mediated by the progressive activation of astrocytes and microglial cells with the consequent overproduction of proinflammatory agents. Here, we discuss about the role of microglial and astrocytic cells, the principal agents in neuroinflammation process, in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. In this context, we also evaluated the potential relevance of natural anti-inflammatory components, which include curcumin and the novel Andean Compound, as agents for AD prevention and as a coadjuvant for AD treatments.  
24795750	Using mice to model Alzheimer's dementia: an overview of the clinical disease and the preclinical behavioral changes in 10 mouse models.
Front Genet 20140423 2014
The goal of this review is to discuss how behavioral tests in mice relate to the pathological and neuropsychological features seen in human Alzheimer's disease (AD), and present a comprehensive analysis of the temporal progression of behavioral impairments in commonly used AD mouse models that contain mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP). We begin with a brief overview of the neuropathological changes seen in the AD brain and an outline of some of the clinical neuropsychological assessments used to measure cognitive deficits associated with the disease. This is followed by a critical assessment of behavioral tasks that are used in AD mice to model the cognitive changes seen in the human disease. Behavioral tests discussed include spatial memory tests [Morris water maze (MWM), radial arm water maze (RAWM), Barnes maze], associative learning tasks (passive avoidance, fear conditioning), alternation tasks (Y-Maze/T-Maze), recognition memory tasks (Novel Object Recognition), attentional tasks (3 and 5 choice serial reaction time), set-shifting tasks, and reversal learning tasks. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these behavioral tasks, and how they may correlate with clinical assessments in humans. Finally, the temporal progression of both cognitive and non-cognitive deficits in 10 AD mouse models (PDAPP, TG2576, APP23, TgCRND8, J20, APP/PS1, TG2576 + PS1 (M146L), APP/PS1 KI, 5Ã—FAD, and 3Ã—Tg-AD) are discussed in detail. Mouse models of AD and the behavioral tasks used in conjunction with those models are immensely important in contributing to our knowledge of disease progression and are a useful tool to study AD pathophysiology and the resulting cognitive deficits. However, investigators need to be aware of the potential weaknesses of the available preclinical models in terms of their ability to model cognitive changes observed in human AD. It is our hope that this review will assist investigators in selecting an appropriate mouse model, and accompanying behavioral paradigms to investigate different aspects of AD pathology and disease progression.  
24795560	Roles of eIF2Î± kinases in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Mol Neurosci 20140416 2014
Cell signaling in response to an array of diverse stress stimuli converges on the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2Î± (eIF2Î±). Evidence is accumulating that persistent eIF2Î± phosphorylation at Ser51 through prolonged overactivation of regulatory kinases occurs in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to shutdown of general translation and translational activation of a subset of mRNAs. Recent advances in the development of gene-based strategies and bioavailable inhibitors, which specifically target one of the eIF2Î± kinases, have enabled us to investigate pathogenic roles of dysregulated eIF2Î± phosphorylation pathways. This review provides an overview of animal model studies in this field, focusing particularly on molecular mechanisms by which the dysregulation of eIF2Î± kinases may account for synaptic and memory deficits associated with AD. A growing body of evidence suggests that correcting aberrant eIF2Î± kinase activities may serve as disease-modifying therapeutic interventions to treat AD and related cognitive disorders.  
24795656	Meditation as a therapeutic intervention for adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease - potential benefits and underlying mechanisms.
Front Psychiatry 20140423 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive, brain disorder that affects at least 5.3 million Americans at an estimated cost of $148 billion, figures that are expected to rise steeply in coming years. Despite decades of research, there is still no cure for AD, and effective therapies for preventing or slowing progression of cognitive decline in at-risk populations remain elusive. Although the etiology of AD remains uncertain, chronic stress, sleep deficits, and mood disturbance, conditions common in those with cognitive impairment, have been prospectively linked to the development and progression of both chronic illness and memory loss and are significant predictors of AD. Therapies such as meditation that specifically target these risk factors may thus hold promise for slowing and possibly preventing cognitive decline in those at risk. In this study, we briefly review the existing evidence regarding the potential utility of meditation as a therapeutic intervention for those with and at risk for AD, discuss possible mechanisms underlying the observed benefits of meditation, and outline directions for future research.  
24679604	Cross-region reduction in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in Alzheimer's disease brain.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140206 2014Aug
Epigenetic processes play a key role in the central nervous system and altered levels of 5-methylcytosine have been associated with a number of neurologic phenotypes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, 3 additional cytosine modifications have been identified (5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine), which are thought to be intermediate steps in the demethylation of 5-methylcytosine to unmodified cytosine. Little is known about the frequency of these modifications in the human brain during health or disease. In this study, we used immunofluorescence to confirm the presence of each modification in human brain and investigate their cross-tissue abundance in AD patients and elderly control samples. We identify a significant AD-associated decrease in global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in entorhinal cortex and cerebellum, and differences in 5-formylcytosine levels between brain regions. Our study further implicates a role for epigenetic alterations in AD.  
24822036	Generation of the Cdk5 activator p25 is a memory mechanism that is affected in early Alzheimer's disease.
Front Mol Neurosci 20140501 2014
About 15 years ago it was proposed that generation of the truncated protein p25 contributes to toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). p25 is a calcium-dependent degradation product of p35, the principal activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). The biochemical properties of p25 suggested that its generation would cause Cdk5 overactivation and tau hyperphosphorylation, a prerequisite for neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation. Whilst this model was appealing as it explained NFT formation, many laboratories could not confirm the finding of increased p25 generation in brain from AD patients. On the contrary, it emerged that p25 levels are reduced in AD. This reduction occurs primarily in the early stages of the disease. Further, p25 generation in the mouse hippocampus is associated with normal memory formation and p25 overexpression enhances synaptogenesis. Therefore, it transpires that p25 generation is a molecular memory mechanism that is impaired in early AD. I discuss the prospect that investigation of p25-regulated proteins will shed light into mechanisms underlying synaptic degeneration associated with memory decline in AD.  
24561250	The role of inflammasome in Alzheimer's disease.
Ageing Res. Rev. 20140219 2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease with clinical characteristics of memory loss, dementia and cognitive impairment. Although the pathophysiologic mechanism is not fully understood, inflammation has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by the activation of glial cells and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that inflammasomes, which cleave precursors of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and IL-18 to generate their active forms, play an important role in the inflammatory response in the CNS and in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, modulating inflammasome complex assembly and activation could be a potential strategy for suppressing inflammation in the CNS. This review aims to provide insight into the role of inflammasomes in the CNS, with respect to the pathogenesis of AD, and may provide possible clues for devising novel therapeutic strategies.  
24495408	Fyn kinase inhibition as a novel therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140205 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, afflicting more than one-third of people over the age of 85. While many therapies for AD are in late-stage clinical testing, rational drug design based on distinct signaling pathways in this disorder is only now emerging. Here we review the putative signaling pathway of amyloid-beta (AÎ²), by which the tyrosine kinase Fyn is activated via cell surface binding of AÎ² oligomers to cellular prion protein. Several lines of evidence implicate Fyn in the pathogenesis of AD, and its interaction with both AÎ² and Tau renders Fyn a unique therapeutic target that addresses both of the major pathologic hallmarks of AD. We are currently enrolling patients in a phase Ib study of saracatinib (AZD0530), a small molecule inhibitor with high potency for Src and Fyn, for the treatment of AD. The results of this trial and a planned phase IIa multisite study will provide important data regarding the potential for this therapeutic strategy in AD.  
24476230	Active immunotherapy options for Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140130 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and a major contributor to disability and dependency among older people. AD pathogenesis is associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (AÎ²) and/or hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain. At present, current therapies provide temporary symptomatic benefit, but do not treat the underlying disease. Recent research has thus focused on investigating the molecular and cellular pathways and processes involved in AD pathogenesis to support the development of effective disease-modifying agents. In accordance with the existing AÎ²-cascade hypothesis for AD pathogenesis, immunotherapy has been the most extensively studied approach in AÎ²-targeted therapy. Both passive and active immunotherapies have been shown to effectively reduce AÎ² accumulation and prevent downstream pathology in preclinical models. Following AN1792, second-generation active immunotherapies have shown promising results in terms of antibody response and safety. Comparatively, tau immunotherapy is not as advanced, but preclinical data support its development into clinical trials. Results from active amyloid-based immunotherapy studies in preclinical models indicate that intervention appears to be more effective in early stages of amyloid accumulation, highlighting the importance of diagnosing AD as early as possible and undertaking clinical trials at this stage. This strategy, combined with improving our understanding of the complex AD pathogenesis, is imperative to the successful development of these disease-modifying agents. This paper will review the active immunotherapies currently in development, including the benefits and challenges associated with this approach.  
24797103	Characterization of new specific copper chelators as potential drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Chemistry 20140505 2014May26
The non-controlled redox-active metal ions, especially copper, in the brain of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) should be considered at the origin of the intense oxidative damage in the AD brain. Several bis(8-aminoquinoline) ligands, such as 1 and PA1637, are able to chelate Cu(2+) with high affinity, and are specific chelators of copper with respect to iron and zinc. They are able to efficiently extract Cu(2+) from a metal-loaded amyloid. In addition, these tetradentate ligands are specific for the chelation of Cu(2+) compared with Cu(+). Consequently, the copper ion is easily released from the bis(8-aminoquinoline) ligand under reductive conditions, and can be trapped again by a protein having some affinity for copper such as human serum albumin (HSA) proteins. In addition, the copper is not efficiently released from [Cu(CQ)2] in reductive conditions. The catalytic production of H2O2 by [Cu(2+)-AÎ²(1-28)]/ascorbate is inhibited in vitro by the bis(8-aminoquinoline) 1, suggesting that 1 should be able to play a protective role against oxidative damages induced by copper-loaded amyloids. 
24548724	Effects of Gingko biloba supplementation in Alzheimer's disease patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors: data from the ICTUS study.
Phytomedicine 20140216 2014May15
Ginkgo biloba (Gb) is currently the most investigated and adopted herbal remedy for cognitive disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, its efficacy in the prevention and treatment of dementia still remains controversial. Specifically, the added effects of Gb in subjects already receiving "conventional" anti-dementia treatments have been to date very scarcely investigated. We evaluated whether the use of Gb is associated with additional cognitive and functional benefit in AD patients already in treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs). Data are from mild to moderate AD patients under ChEI treatment recruited in the Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe (ICTUS) study. Mixed model analyses were performed to measure six-monthly modifications in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) subscale score, and the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale over a follow-up of 1 year according to the additional Gb supplementation. A total of 828 subjects were considered for the present analyses. Significantly different modifications at the MMSE score over the 12-month follow-up were reported between patients on combined therapy compared to those only taking ChEIs. On the contrary, the modification of the ADAS-Cog score between the two groups did not show statistically significant differences, although similar trends were noticed. No significant modifications of the two adopted outcome measures were observed at the mid-term 6-month evaluation. The modifications over time of the ADL score did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups of interest. Our findings suggest that Gb may provide some added cognitive benefits in AD patients already under ChEIs treatment. The clinical meaningfulness of such effects remains to be confirmed and clarified.  
24646317	p53 functional inhibitors behaving like pifithrin-Î² counteract the Alzheimer peptide non-Î²-amyloid component effects in human SH-SY5Y cells.
ACS Chem Neurosci 20140328 2014May21
Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops from a complex setting of genetic and biochemical alterations, including an increased level of p53 in the brain. Here, the robust and specific activation of p53 by the fibrillar non-Î²-amyloid component (NAC) of AD was demonstrated in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. For the first time, the increase in the level of p53 target gene transcription, the cell cycle arrest, and the induction of apoptosis elicited by NAC were evidenced. These effects were counterbalanced by pifithrin-Î², a small molecule interfering with the p53 functions. Using the structure of a pifithrin-Î² analogue as a reference, a pharmacophore-based virtual screening of the ZINC database was performed. Among the resulting hits, 20 druglike heterocyclic compounds were selected and evaluated for their neuroprotective activity against fibrillar NAC in the human SH-SY5Y cellular model. Three compounds exhibited neuroprotective effects. In particular, 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-methyl-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine resulted in a promising lead compound for further development of anti-AD agents in terms of neuroprotection, reducing the rate of NAC-induced cell death with an activity higher than that of pifithrin-Î², as a result of a more effective functional inhibition of p53 target gene transcription. 
24845946	Outcomes of Alzheimer's disease therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine.
Expert Opin Drug Saf  2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a world-wide health problem with implications for an increasing number of people and countries. Populations suffering from AD financially strain the healthcare budgets of rich and poor countries alike. Moreover, no effective treatment is available and current drugs merely slow the progression of cognitive function deterioration and overall health status toward an inevitable end point. An increasing number of novel approaches have been tested in numerous clinical trials, but none of them has proved safe and effective for treating AD. This review summarizes all currently available compounds (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine) for the management of AD, concentrating on clinical aspects such as the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical trials. This review also considers the mechanisms and side effects to provide perspective on current treatment options. Novel approaches in the treatment of AD are being intensively tested, but so far without any major success. Patients diagnosed with AD still mostly benefit from four compounds to significantly improve cognition functions and overall health and help manage other symptoms or even prolong the symptom-free period. 
24847267	HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease: more than a hypothesis.
Front Pharmacol 20140507 2014
Among the multiple factors concurring to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, greater attention should be devoted to the role played by infectious agents. Growing epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that recurrent herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection is a risk factor for AD although the underlying molecular and functional mechanisms have not been fully elucidated yet. Here, we review literature suggesting the involvement of HSV-1 infection in AD also briefly mentioning possible pharmacological implications of these findings.  
24846272	Overexpression of the IGF-II/M6P receptor in mouse fibroblast cell lines differentially alters expression profiles of genes involved in Alzheimer's disease-related pathology.
PLoS ONE 20140520 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia affecting elderly people. The processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) peptide contributes to neurodegeneration and development of AD pathology. The endocytic trafficking pathway, which comprises of the endosomes and lysosomes, acts as an important site for AÎ² generation, and endocytic dysfunction has been linked to increased AÎ² production and loss of neurons in AD brains. Since insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) receptor plays a critical role in the transport of lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, it is likely that the receptor may have a role in regulating AÎ² metabolism in AD pathology. However, very little is known on how altered levels of the IGF-II receptor can influence the expression/function of various molecules involved in AD pathology. To address this issue, we evaluated the expression profiles of 87 selected genes related to AD pathology in mouse fibroblast MS cells that are deficient in murine IGF-II receptor and corresponding MS9II cells overexpressing âˆ¼ 500 times the human IGF-II receptors. Our results reveal that an elevation in IGF-II receptor levels alters the expression profiles of a number of genes including APP as well as enzymes regulating AÎ² production, degradation and clearance mechanisms. Additionally, it influences the expression of various lysosomal enzymes and protein kinases that are involved in AÎ² toxicity. IGF-II receptor overexpression also alters expression of several genes involved in intracellular signalling as well as cholesterol metabolism, which play a critical role in AD pathology. The altered gene profiles observed in this study closely match with the corresponding protein levels, with a few exceptions. These results, taken together, suggest that an elevation in IGF-II receptor levels can influence the expression profiles of transcripts as well as proteins that are involved in AD pathogenesis. 
24860495	The role of intracellular zinc release in aging, oxidative stress, and Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140417 2014
Brain aging is marked by structural, chemical, and genetic changes leading to cognitive decline and impaired neural functioning. Further, aging itself is also a risk factor for a number of neurodegenerative disorders, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many of the pathological changes associated with aging and aging-related disorders have been attributed in part to increased and unregulated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain. ROS are produced as a physiological byproduct of various cellular processes, and are normally detoxified by enzymes and antioxidants to help maintain neuronal homeostasis. However, cellular injury can cause excessive ROS production, triggering a state of oxidative stress that can lead to neuronal cell death. ROS and intracellular zinc are intimately related, as ROS production can lead to oxidation of proteins that normally bind the metal, thereby causing the liberation of zinc in cytoplasmic compartments. Similarly, not only can zinc impair mitochondrial function, leading to excess ROS production, but it can also activate a variety of extra-mitochondrial ROS-generating signaling cascades. As such, numerous accounts of oxidative neuronal injury by ROS-producing sources appear to also require zinc. We suggest that zinc deregulation is a common, perhaps ubiquitous component of injurious oxidative processes in neurons. This review summarizes current findings on zinc dyshomeostasis-driven signaling cascades in oxidative stress and age-related neurodegeneration, with a focus on AD, in order to highlight the critical role of the intracellular liberation of the metal during oxidative neuronal injury.  
24860502	Resveratrol and Alzheimer's disease: message in a bottle on red wine and cognition.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140514 2014
Cognitive impairment is the final outcome of a complex network of molecular mechanisms ultimately leading to dementia. Despite major efforts aimed at unraveling the molecular determinants of dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), effective disease-modifying approaches are still missing. An interesting and still largely unexplored avenue is offered by nutraceutical intervention. For instance, robust epidemiological data have suggested that moderate intake of red wine may protect against several age-related pathological conditions (i.e., cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer) as well as DAT-related cognitive decline. Wine is highly enriched in many polyphenols, including resveratrol. Resveratrol is a well recognized antioxidant which may modulate metal ion deregulation outcomes as well as main features of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. The review will discuss the potentiality of resveratrol as a neuroprotectant in dementia in relation to the oxidative stress produced by amyloid and metal dysmetabolism.  
24860500	Metals and cholesterol: two sides of the same coin in Alzheimer's disease pathology.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140515 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease. It begins years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms, such as memory loss and cognitive decline. Pathological hallmarks of AD include the accumulation of Î²-amyloid in plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles. Copper, iron, and zinc are abnormally accumulated and distributed in the aging brain. These metal ions can adversely contribute to the progression of AD. Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism has also been implicated in the development of AD pathology. To date, large bodies of research have been carried out independently to elucidate the role of metals or cholesterol on AD pathology. Interestingly, metals and cholesterol affect parallel molecular and biochemical pathways involved in AD pathology. The possible links between metal dyshomeostasis and altered brain cholesterol metabolism in AD are reviewed.  
24868482	Electroencephalogram and Alzheimer's disease: clinical and research approaches.
Int J Alzheimers Dis 20140424 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by cognitive deficits, problems in activities of daily living, and behavioral disturbances. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been demonstrated as a reliable tool in dementia research and diagnosis. The application of EEG in AD has a wide range of interest. EEG contributes to the differential diagnosis and the prognosis of the disease progression. Additionally such recordings can add important information related to the drug effectiveness. This review is prepared to form a knowledge platform for the project entitled "Cognitive Signal Processing Lab," which is in progress in Information Technology Institute in Thessaloniki. The team tried to focus on the main research fields of AD via EEG and recent published studies.  
24876993	Targeting mRNA for Alzheimer's and related dementias.
Scientifica (Cairo) 20140427 2014
Brain deposition of the amyloid beta-protein (A Î² ) and tau are characteristic features in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mutations in the A Î² precursor protein (APP) and a protease involved in A Î² production from APP strongly argue for a pathogenic role of A Î² in AD, while mutations in tau are associated with related disorders collectively called frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Despite intense effort, therapeutic strategies that target A Î² or tau have not yet yielded medications, suggesting that alternative approaches should be pursued. In recent years, our laboratory has studied the role of mRNA in AD and FTLD, specifically those encoding tau and the A Î² -producing protease BACE1. As many FTLD-causing tau mutations destabilize a hairpin structure that regulates RNA splicing, we have targeted this structure with small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, and small molecule-antisense conjugates. We have also discovered that microRNA interaction with the 3'-untranslated region of tau regulates tau expression. Regarding BACE1, we found that alternative splicing leads to inactive splice isoforms and antisense oligonucleotides shift splicing toward these inactive isoforms to decrease A Î² production. In addition, a G-quadruplex structure in the BACE1 mRNA plays a role in splice regulation. The prospects for targeting tau and BACE1 mRNAs as therapeutic strategies will be discussed.  
24904407	The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 and amyloid-Î² clearance in Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140520 2014
Accumulation and aggregation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides in the brain trigger the development of progressive neurodegeneration and dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Perturbation in AÎ² clearance, rather than AÎ² production, is likely the cause of sporadic, late-onset AD, which accounts for the majority of AD cases. Since cellular uptake and subsequent degradation constitute a major AÎ² clearance pathway, the receptor-mediated endocytosis of AÎ² has been intensely investigated. Among AÎ² receptors, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is one of the most studied receptors. LRP1 is a large endocytic receptor for more than 40 ligands, including apolipoprotein E, Î±2-macroglobulin and AÎ². Emerging in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrates that LRP1 is critically involved in brain AÎ² clearance. LRP1 is highly expressed in a variety of cell types in the brain including neurons, vascular cells and glial cells, where LRP1 functions to maintain brain homeostasis and control AÎ² metabolism. LRP1-mediated endocytosis regulates cellular AÎ² uptake by binding to AÎ² either directly or indirectly through its co-receptors or ligands. Furthermore, LRP1 regulates several signaling pathways, which also likely influences AÎ² endocytic pathways. In this review, we discuss how LRP1 regulates the brain AÎ² clearance and how this unique endocytic receptor participates in AD pathogenesis. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying LRP1-mediated AÎ² clearance should enable the rational design of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AD.  
24513321	Alzheimer's disease therapeutics targeted to the control of amyloid precursor protein translation: maintenance of brain iron homeostasis.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140207 2014Apr15
The neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (AÎ²), a major cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is enhanced by iron, as found in the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. By contrast, the long-known neuroprotective activity of APP is evident after Î±-secretase cleavage of the precursor to release sAPPÎ±, and depends on the iron export actions of APP itself. The latter underlie its neurotrophic and protective effects in facilitating the homeostatic actions of ferroportin mediated-iron export. Thus APP-dependent iron export may alleviate oxidative stress by minimizing labile iron thus protecting neurons from iron overload during stroke and hemorrhage. Consistent with this, altered phosphorylation of iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) and its signaling processes play a critical role in modulating APP translation via the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of its transcript. The APP 5'UTR region encodes a functional iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop that represents a potential target for modulating APP production. Targeted regulation of APP gene expression via the modulation of 5'UTR sequence function represents a novel approach for the potential treatment of AD since altering APP translation can be used to improve both the protective brain iron balance and provide anti-amyloid efficacy. Approved drugs including paroxetine and desferrioxamine and several novel compounds have been identified that suppress abnormal metal-promoted AÎ² accumulation with a subset of these acting via APP 5'UTR-dependent mechanisms to modulate APP translation and cleavage to generate the non-toxic sAPPÎ±.  
24469452	F-box only protein 2 (Fbxo2) regulates amyloid precursor protein levels and processing.
J. Biol. Chem. 20140127 2014Mar7
The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an integral membrane glycoprotein whose cleavage products, particularly amyloid-Î², accumulate in Alzheimer disease (AD). APP is present at synapses and is thought to play a role in both the formation and plasticity of these critical neuronal structures. Despite the central role suggested for APP in AD pathogenesis, the mechanisms regulating APP in neurons and its processing into cleavage products remain incompletely understood. F-box only protein 2 (Fbxo2), a neuron-enriched ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor that preferentially binds high-mannose glycans on glycoproteins, was previously implicated in APP processing by facilitating the degradation of the APP-cleaving Î²-secretase, Î²-site APP-cleaving enzyme. Here, we sought to determine whether Fbxo2 plays a similar role for other glycoproteins in the amyloid processing pathway. We present in vitro and in vivo evidence that APP is itself a substrate for Fbxo2. APP levels were decreased in the presence of Fbxo2 in non-neuronal cells, and increased in both cultured hippocampal neurons and brain tissue from Fbxo2 knock-out mice. The processing of APP into its cleavage products was also increased in hippocampi and cultured hippocampal neurons lacking Fbxo2. In hippocampal slices, this increase in cleavage products was accompanied by a significant reduction in APP at the cell surface. Taken together, these results suggest that Fbxo2 regulates APP levels and processing in the brain and may play a role in modulating AD pathogenesis.  
23995817	Demographic and neuropsychiatric factors associated with off-label medication use in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Apr-Jun
Off-label medication use for treating cognitive impairments and neuropsychiatric symptoms occurs in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer disease (AD). We compared the use of cognitive and psychiatric medications in FTD and AD and evaluated the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms and medication use. Cognitive and psychiatric medication use, demographic variables, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) subscale symptoms were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (n=3958, 8.1% FTD). Bivariate statistics and logistic regressions were calculated to evaluate which demographic or NPI subscale symptoms predicted medication use. Although cognitive medication was used more commonly in AD (78%), it was also commonly used off-label in FTD (56%). Psychiatric medications were in greater use in FTD than in AD (68% vs. 45%, respectively, P&lt;0.001). In FTD, cognitive medication use was associated with elevated NPI elation scores and psychiatric medication use was associated with history of prior psychiatric disease. In AD, demographic variables (white, longer disease duration, higher education, more severe disease, or being male) were most predictive of cognitive medication use, whereas having psychiatric disease, being white, having longer disease duration, being younger, greater disease severity, and being disinhibited or anxious were associated with psychiatric medication use. Off-label antipsychotics were used by 4.7% of patients with AD and 10% of patients with FTD. Our results revealed significant off-label medication use in both FTD and AD. A notable finding from this study was the lack of consistent relationships between medication use and neuropsychiatric symptoms across the 2 illnesses. 
24548606	What is normal in normal aging? Effects of aging, amyloid and Alzheimer's disease on the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus.
Prog. Neurobiol. 20140216 2014Jun
What can be expected in normal aging, and where does normal aging stop and pathological neurodegeneration begin? With the slow progression of age-related dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is difficult to distinguish age-related changes from effects of undetected disease. We review recent research on changes of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in aging and the borders between normal aging and AD. We argue that prominent cortical reductions are evident in fronto-temporal regions in elderly even with low probability of AD, including regions overlapping the default mode network. Importantly, these regions show high levels of amyloid deposition in AD, and are both structurally and functionally vulnerable early in the disease. This normalcy-pathology homology is critical to understand, since aging itself is the major risk factor for sporadic AD. Thus, rather than necessarily reflecting early signs of disease, these changes may be part of normal aging, and may inform on why the aging brain is so much more susceptible to AD than is the younger brain. We suggest that regions characterized by a high degree of life-long plasticity are vulnerable to detrimental effects of normal aging, and that this age-vulnerability renders them more susceptible to additional, pathological AD-related changes. We conclude that it will be difficult to understand AD without understanding why it preferably affects older brains, and that we need a model that accounts for age-related changes in AD-vulnerable regions independently of AD-pathology.  
24746933	Elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140416 2014Jun6
Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is a neuronal glycolytic enzyme of which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels are found altered following acute or prolonged neuronal damage. Investigations concerning the role of NSE in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are conflicting with both elevated and reduced levels. We measured CSF-levels of NSE in 32 patients with AD and 32 healthy subjects (HS) using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Mean levels of adjusted NSE were significantly elevated in AD (18.12 ng/mL (95% CI 15.63-20.60), HS 8.46 ng/mL (95% CI 5.98-10.94), p=0.00002) and effect size for mean group differences high (1.84). NSE alone (cut-off score 15.80 ng/mL, 94% sensitivity, 97% specificity) and in combination with T-tau and P-Tau had high diagnostic accuracy to differentiate AD from HS. NSE correlated significantly with T-tau (r â‰¥ 0.87, p&lt;0.000001) and P-tau (r â‰¥ 0.88, p&lt;0.000001) in both AD and HS. Our results indicate elevated CSF-NSE levels to reflect altered neuronal metabolism in AD that may be used in supporting AD diagnostics. 
24949214	Altered proteolysis in fibroblasts of Alzheimer patients with predictive implications for subjects at risk of disease.
Int J Alzheimers Dis 20140518 2014
There is great interest in developing reliable biomarkers to support antemortem diagnosis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early prediction and diagnosis of AD might be improved by the detection of a proteolytic dysfunction in extracts from cultured AD fibroblasts, producing altered isoelectrophoretic forms of the enzyme transketolase (TK-alkaline bands). The TK profile and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype were examined in fibroblasts from 36 clinically diagnosed probable late-onset sporadic AD patients and 38 of their asymptomatic relatives, 29 elderly healthy individuals, 12 neurological non-AD patients, and 5 early-onset AD patients. TK alterations occurred in (i) several probable AD patients regardless of age-of-onset and severity of disease; (ii) all early-onset AD patients and APOE Îµ 4/4 carriers; and (iii) nearly half of asymptomatic AD relatives. Normal subjects and non-AD patients were all negative. Notably, culture conditions promoting TK alterations were also effective in increasing active BACE1 levels. Overall, the TK assay might represent a low-cost laboratory tool useful for supporting AD differential diagnosis and identifying asymptomatic subjects who are at greater risk of AD and who should enter a follow-up study. Moreover, the cultured fibroblasts were confirmed as a useful in vitro model for further studies on the pathogenetic process of AD.  
24212033	A method of semi-quantifying Î²-AP in brain PET-CT 11C-PiB images.
Biomed Mater Eng  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common health problem for elderly populations. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)11C-PiB for beta-P (amyloid-Î² peptide, Î²-AP) imaging is an advanced method to diagnose AD in early stage. However, in practice radiologists lack a standardized value to semi-quantify Î²-AP. This paper proposes such a standardized value: SVÎ²-AP. This standardized value measures the mean ratio between the dimension of Î²-AP areas in PET and CT images. A computer aided diagnosis approach is also proposed to achieve SVÎ²-AP. A simulation experiment was carried out to pre-test the technical feasibility of the CAD approach and SVÎ²-AP. The experiment results showed that it is technically feasible.  
24338704	CASP3 protein expression by flow cytometry in Down's syndrome subjects.
Hum. Cell 20131213 2014Jan
Down's syndrome (DS), the most common chromosomal disorder, is caused by 21 trisomy and is featured by intellectual disability. Subjects with DS can develop some traits of Alzheimer disease (AD) at an earlier age than subjects without trisomy 21. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process under both normal physiological and pathological conditions. Caspase-3 (CASP3) plays an important role in neuronal death during nervous system development and under certain pathological conditions. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies report elevated expression and activation of CASP3 in models of AD. On this account, the expression of CASP3 gene was evaluated in cultures of fibroblasts of DS and normal subjects by flow cytometry. CASP3 protein was up-regulated in fibroblasts of DS. The data obtained from this study strengthen the hypothesis that the over-expression of CASP3 gene could have a role in the activation of the apoptotic pathways acting in the neurodegenerative processes in DS.  
24601543	Retro-inversal of intracellular selected Î²-amyloid-interacting peptides: implications for a novel Alzheimer's disease treatment.
Biochemistry 20140321 2014Apr8
The aggregation of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) into toxic oligomers is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here we present a novel approach for the development of peptides capable of preventing amyloid aggregation based upon the previous selection of natural all-l peptides that bind AÎ²1-42. Using an intracellular selection system, successful library members were further screened via competition selection to identify the most effective peptides capable of reducing amyloid levels. To circumvent potential issues arising from stability and protease action for these structures, we have replaced all l residues with d residues and inverted the sequence. These retro-inverso (RI) peptide analogues therefore encompass reversed sequences that maintain the overall topological order of the native peptides. Our results demonstrate that efficacy in blocking and reversing amyloid formation is maintained while introducing desirable properties to the peptides. Thioflavin-T assays, circular dichroism, and oblique angle fluorescence microscopy collectively indicate that RI peptides can reduce amyloid load, while 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays demonstrate modest reductions in cell toxicity. These conclusions are reinforced using Drosophila melanogaster studies to monitor pupal hatching rates and fly locomotor activity in the presence of RI peptides delivered via RI-trans-activating transcriptional activator peptide fusions. We demonstrate that the RI-protein fragment complementation assay approach can be used as a generalized method for deriving AÎ²-interacting peptides. This approach has subsequently led to several peptide candidates being further explored as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease.  
24732467	IGF2 ameliorates amyloidosis, increases cholinergic marker expression and raises BMP9 and neurotrophin levels in the hippocampus of the APPswePS1dE9 Alzheimer's disease model mice.
PLoS ONE 20140414 2014
The development of an effective therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major challenge to biomedical sciences. Because much of early AD pathophysiology includes hippocampal abnormalities, a viable treatment strategy might be to use trophic factors that support hippocampal integrity and function. IGF2 is an attractive candidate as it acts in the hippocampus to enhance memory consolidation, stimulate adult neurogenesis and upregulate cholinergic marker expression and acetylcholine (ACh) release. We performed a seven-day intracerebroventricular infusion of IGF2 in transgenic APPswe.PS1dE9 AD model mice that express green fluorescent protein in cholinergic neurons (APP.PS1/CHGFP) and in wild type WT/CHGFP littermates at 6 months of age representing early AD-like disease. IGF2 reduced the number of hippocampal AÎ²40- and AÎ²42-positive amyloid plaques in APP.PS1/CHGFP mice. Moreover, IGF2 increased hippocampal protein levels of the ACh-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase in both WT/CHGFP and APP.PS1/CHGFP mice. The latter effect was likely mediated by increased protein expression of the cholinergic differentiating factor, BMP9, observed in IGF2-treated mice as compared to controls. IGF2 also increased the protein levels of hippocampal NGF, BDNF, NT3 and IGF1 and of doublecortin, a marker of neurogenesis. These data show that IGF2 administration is effective in reversing and preventing several pathophysiologic processes associated with AD and suggest that IGF2 may constitute a therapeutic target for AD.  
24680777	Progranulin polymorphism rs5848 is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Gene 20140325 2014Jun1
Progranulin is the precursor of granulins, and its down-regulation leads to neurodegeneration. Recent studies have indicated an association of progranulin polymorphism rs5848 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the results remain controversial. To verify the association between rs5848 and AD risk, we retrieved the published literature from PubMed and other databases, and performed a meta-analysis by pooling all five studies containing 2502 AD cases and 2162 controls. The results showed that rs5848 is associated with increased risk of AD in homozygous (TT vs. CC: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11-1.66; P=0.003) and recessive models (TT vs. CC+CT: OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.58; P=0.006). This association was remained in Caucasian (2227 cases and 1902 controls). Our data indicate that TT allele of rs5848 is associated with increased risk of AD, suggesting that genetic variant of progranulin gene may play an important role in AD development.  
24696507	Clinical trial of an inhibitor of RAGE-AÎ² interactions in Alzheimer disease.
Neurology 20140402 2014Apr29
To examine safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PF-04494700, an inhibitor of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 40 academic centers (United States). Subjects with AD and Mini-Mental State Examination score 14-26 were randomized to PF-04494700 60 mg/day Ã— 6 days, then 20 mg daily (high dose); 15 mg/day Ã— 6 days, then 5 mg daily (low dose); or placebo, for 18 months. Clinical and laboratory measures were used to evaluate safety and tolerability. The primary efficacy measure was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog). Secondary measures assessed clinical stage, function, behavior, MRI, and CSF biomarkers. A total of 399 subjects were randomized. In a prespecified interim analysis, when 50% of subjects had completed the 6-month visit, the high dose was associated with confusion, falls, and greater ADAS-cog decline and was discontinued. A second prespecified analysis compared low-dose and placebo groups for futility and safety approximately 12 months after all subjects were randomized. This analysis met criteria for futility, and treatment was discontinued. There were no safety concerns in the low-dose group. Analyses including post-futility data showed decreased decline on the ADAS-cog in the low-dose group at month 18. Other clinical and biomarker measures showed no differences between low-dose treatment and placebo. PF-04494700 at 20 mg/d was associated with increased adverse events and cognitive decline. At 5 mg/d, PF-04494700 had a good safety profile. A potential benefit for this low dose on the ADAS-cog is not conclusive, because of high dropout and discontinuation rates subsequent to the interim analyses. This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with AD high-dose PF-04494700 increased cognitive decline at 6 months and Class IV evidence that low-dose PF-04494700 slowed cognitive decline at 18 months. 
24790184	Peripheral administration of a humanized anti-PrP antibody blocks Alzheimer's disease AÎ² synaptotoxicity.
J. Neurosci.  2014Apr30
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with pathological assembly states of amyloid-Î² protein (AÎ²). AÎ²-related synaptotoxicity can be blocked by anti-prion protein (PrP) antibodies, potentially allowing therapeutic targeting of this aspect of AD neuropathogenesis. Here, we show that intravascular administration of a high-affinity humanized anti-PrP antibody to rats can prevent the plasticity-disrupting effects induced by exposure to soluble AD brain extract. These results provide an in vivo proof of principle for such a therapeutic strategy.  
24786080	Polarization of the effects of autoimmune and neurodegenerative risk alleles in leukocytes.
Science  2014May2
To extend our understanding of the genetic basis of human immune function and dysfunction, we performed an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study of purified CD4(+) T cells and monocytes, representing adaptive and innate immunity, in a multi-ethnic cohort of 461 healthy individuals. Context-specific cis- and trans-eQTLs were identified, and cross-population mapping allowed, in some cases, putative functional assignment of candidate causal regulatory variants for disease-associated loci. We note an over-representation of T cell-specific eQTLs among susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases and of monocyte-specific eQTLs among Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease variants. This polarization implicates specific immune cell types in these diseases and points to the need to identify the cell-autonomous effects of disease susceptibility variants.  
24652830	Diabetes and elevated hemoglobin A1c levels are associated with brain hypometabolism but not amyloid accumulation.
J. Nucl. Med. 20140320 2014May
Dysfunctional insulin signaling may affect brain metabolism or amyloid deposition. We investigated the associations of type 2 diabetes with amyloid accumulation measured using (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) and brain hypometabolism measured using (18)F-FDG PET. We studied a sample of nondemented participants from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. All subjects underwent MR imaging, amyloid PET, and (18)F-FDG PET. Alzheimer disease (AD) signature and region-of-interest (ROI) measures for (11)C-PiB retention ratio and (18)F-FDG ratio were measured. Diabetes was assessed from the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system. Among 749 participants (median age, 79.0 y; 56.5% men, 81.0% cognitively normal; 20.6% diabetic individuals), (18)F-FDG hypometabolism ((18)F-FDG ratio &lt; 1.31) in the AD signature meta-ROI was more common in diabetic individuals (48.1%) than in nondiabetic individuals (28.9%; P &lt; 0.001). The median (18)F-FDG ratio was lower in diabetic individuals than in nondiabetic individuals in the AD signature meta-ROI (1.32 vs. 1.40, P &lt; 0.001) and in the angular (1.40 vs. 1.48, P &lt; 0.001) and posterior cingulate gyri ROIs (1.63 vs. 1.72, P &lt; 0.001). The odds ratio (OR) for abnormal AD signature (18)F-FDG hypometabolism was elevated (2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-3.33) in diabetic individuals versus nondiabetic individuals after adjustment for age, sex, and education and after additional adjustment for apolipoprotein Îµ4 allele, glycemic level, and cognitive status (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.10-2.60). However, the AD signature (11)C-PiB retention ratio was similar in diabetic individuals versus nondiabetic individuals (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.71-1.51; P = 0.87). In post hoc analyses in nondiabetic individuals, a 1% increase in hemoglobin A1c was associated with greater AD signature hypometabolism in cognitively normal subjects (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03-3.62; P = 0.04) and in the total cohort (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 0.92-2.75; P = 0.10). Diabetes and poor glycemic control in nondiabetic individuals may enhance glucose hypometabolism in AD signature regions. These factors should be investigated in longitudinal studies for their role in detecting onset of symptoms in AD. 
24736054	Potential new diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease using a linear discriminant function for Fourier domain optical coherence tomography.
Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 20140508 2014May
We calculated and validated a linear discriminant function (LDF) for Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) to improve the diagnostic ability of retinal and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness parameters in the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We enrolled AD patients (n = 151) and age-matched, healthy subjects (n = 61). The Cirrus and Spectralis OCT systems were used to obtain retinal measurements and circumpapillary RNFL thickness for each participant. An LDF was calculated using all retinal and RNFL OCT measurements. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted and compared among the LDF and the standard parameters provided by OCT devices. Sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate diagnostic performance. A validating set was used in an independent population to test the performance of the LDF. The optimal function was calculated using the RNFL thickness provided by Spectralis OCT, using the 768 points registered during peripapillary scan acquisition (grouped to obtain 24 uniformly divided locations): 18.325 + 0.056 Ã— (315Â°-330Â°) - 0.122 Ã— (300Â°-315Â°) - 0.041 Ã— (285Â°-300Â°) + 0.091 Ã— (255Â°-270Â°) + 0.041 Ã— (225Â°-240Â°) + 0.183 Ã— (195Â°-210Â°) - 0.108 Ã— (150Â°-165Â°) - 0.092 Ã— (75Â°-90Â°) + 0.051 Ã— (30Â°-45Â°). The largest area under the ROC curve was 0.967 for the LDF. At 95% fixed specificity, the LDF yielded the highest sensitivity values. Measurements of RNFL thickness obtained with the Spectralis OCT device differentiated between healthy and AD individuals. Based on the area under the ROC curve, the LDF was a better predictor than any single parameter. 
24827165	MicroRNA-384 regulates both amyloid precursor protein and Î²-secretase expression and is a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Mol. Med. 20140513 2014Jul
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Î²-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE-1) play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, using bioinformatics analysis, we demonstrate that miR-384 is a microRNA (miRNA or miR) predicted to potentially target the 3'Â untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of both APP and BACE-1. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with miR-384 mimic oligonucleotide, miR-384 inhibitor oligonucleotide, or a non-specific control siRNA. We found that the overexpression of miR-384 suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of both APP and BACE-1. The miR-384 inhibitor oligonucleotide induced the upregulation of APP and BACE-1. The activity of BACE-1 was altered following the change in its protein expression. The binding sites of miR-384 on the 3'-UTRs of APP and BACE-1 were identified by luciferase assay. Furthermore, cells were treasted with amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)42. AÎ²42 downregulated miR-384 expression, leading to the continuous reduction in miR-384 expression. In addition, using a mouse model of AD, as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), we examined the levels of miR-384 in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and serum. Patients with MCI and DAT had lower blood miR-384 levels compared with the controls. In addition, patients with DAT had lower blood miR-384 levels in blood compared with the MCI group. We also found decreased miR-384 expression in the several cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of the patients with DAT. Negative correlations were observed between miR-384 and AÎ²42 in the serum and CSF from patients with AD. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that miR-384 may plays a role in the development of AD and may be a potential non-invasive biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.  
24768431	Habitual physical activity (HPA) as a factor in sustained executive function in Alzheimer-type dementia: a cohort study.
Arch Gerontol Geriatr 20140405 2014 Jul-Aug
Evidence from studies on healthy older adults and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) populations suggests that physical activity interventions have a positive effect on executive function. In this study, we consider whether HPA is positively associated with executive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Eighty-two participants with a diagnosis of mild to moderate AD completed six measures of executive function. Objective measures of physical status were taken. In addition, informants completed questionnaires on the participants' HPA and other lifestyle factors. A composite measure of executive function was the primary outcome. A multistage multiple regression was used to determine how much variance HPA accounted for. The final model comprised disease severity, cognitive reserve, cognitive activities, neuropsychiatric status and HPA status. The final model accounted for a total of 57% of the variance of executive performance, of which HPA itself accounted for 8% of the variance. HPA status is associated executive performance in an AD population even after controlling for key covariates. The findings encourage clinicians to recommend HPA and its cognitive benefits to AD patients and their carers.  
24628842	Î²-Amyloid pathology alters neural network activation during retrieval of contextual fear memories in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Eur. J. Neurosci. 20140316 2014May
Although episodic memory deficits are the most conspicuous cognitive change in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients also display alterations in emotional expression, including anxiety and impaired conditioned fear behaviours. The neural circuitry underlying emotional learning is known to involve the amygdala and hippocampus, although the precise impact of amyloid pathology on the interaction between these brain regions remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that Tg2576 mice, which express a human amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation associated with early-onset AD, demonstrate normal acquisition of conditioned freezing to auditory and contextual stimuli paired with footshock. However, examination of the expression of c-Fos revealed altered neural network activity in transgenic mice. In the present study we examined the effects of the APP mutation on the expression of c-Fos following the retrieval of emotional memories. To this end, stimulus-induced cellular activity was measured by analysing expression of the immediate-early gene c-Fos after the retrieval of auditory or contextual fear memories. To characterize regional interdependencies of c-Fos expression, structural equation modelling was used to compare patterns of neural network activity. Consistent with previous findings, Tg2576 mice displayed reduced freezing elicited by the auditory stimulus but not by the conditioning context. Interestingly, the analysis of c-Fos expression revealed that the APPswe mutation disrupted dentate gyrus and amygdala function, as well as altering the influence of these regions on the neural network dynamics activated during context memory retrieval. These results provide novel insight into the influence of excess amyloid production on neural network activity during memory retrieval.  
24766626	Synthesis and characterization of (68)Ga-labeled curcumin and curcuminoid complexes as potential radiotracers for imaging of cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
Inorg Chem 20140425 2014May19
Curcumin (CUR) and curcuminoids complexes labeled with fluorine-18 or technetium-99m have recently shown their potential as diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's disease. Gallium-68 is a positron-emitting, generator-produced radionuclide, and its properties can be exploited in situ in medical facilities without a cyclotron. Moreover, CUR showed a higher uptake in tumor cells compared to normal cells, suggesting potential diagnostic applications in this field. In spite of this, no studies using labeled CUR have been performed in this direction, so far. Herein, (68)Ga-labeled complexes with CUR and two curcuminoids, namely diacetyl-curcumin (DAC) and bis(dehydroxy)curcumin (bDHC), were synthesized and characterized by means of experimental and theoretical approaches. Moreover, a first evaluation of their affinity to synthetic Î²-amyloid fibrils and uptake by A549 lung cancer cells was performed to show the potential application of these new labeled curcuminoids in these diagnostic fields. The radiotracers were prepared by reacting (68)Ga(3+) obtained from a (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator with 1 mg/mL curcuminoids solutions. Reaction parameters (precursor amount, reaction temperature, and pH) were optimized to obtain high and reproducible radiochemical yield and purity. Stoichiometry and formation of the curcuminoid complexes were investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, NMR, ultraviolet-visible, and fluorescence spectroscopy on the equivalent (nat)Ga-curcuminoids (nat = natural) complexes, and their structure was computed by theoretical density functional theory calculations. The analyses evidenced that CUR, DAC, and bDHC were predominantly in the keto-enol form and attested to Ga(L)2(+) species formation. Identity of the (68)Ga(L)2(+) complexes was confirmed by coelution with the equivalent (nat)Ga(L)2(+) complexes in ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography analyses.(68)Ga(CUR)2(+), (68)Ga(DAC)2(+), and (68)Ga(bDHC)2(+) were highly (87 Â± 4, 90 Â± 1%) and moderately (48 Â± 2%), respectively, retained by synthetic Î²-amyloid fibrils in vitro. All the Ga-curcuminoid complexes showed an uptake in A549 lung cancer cells, at least equivalent to the respective free curcuminoids, confirming potential applications as cancer-detecting radiotracers.  
23879292	Pseudoexfoliation and Alzheimer's disease: a population-based 30-year follow-up study.
Acta Ophthalmol 20130723 2014Jun
â€‚ To determine the effect of pseudoexfoliation (PEX) on the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a population in which PEX is a common finding. The relationship between open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and AD was also studied. â€‚ Predictors of incident AD, including mixed and unspecified dementia, were analysed in a cohort of 679 residents 65-74 years of age, examined in a population survey in the municipality of Tierp, Sweden, 1984-1986. To expand the cohort, participants in other studies in Tierp were enrolled. In this way, the cohort embraced 1123 people, representing more than 15,700 person-years at risk. Medical records were reviewed to identify subjects diagnosed with dementia. Those with a follow-up time shorter than 2 years were excluded from the study. â€‚ By the conclusion of the study, in December 2011, 174 new cases of AD, including mixed and unspecified dementia, had been detected, 41 of whom were affected by PEX at baseline. Higher age and female gender were the only predictors identified. No association between PEX and AD was found (hazard ratio 0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.69-1.40). Newly diagnosed OAG at baseline did not increase the risk (hazard ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 0.69-1.74). â€‚ Pseudoexfoliation is not a predictor of AD. No association was found between OAG and AD. 
24836739	Systematic review of clinical trials assessing pharmacological properties of Salvia species on memory, cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
CNS Neurosci Ther 20140410 2014Jun
Salvia officinalis L. and Salvia lavandulaefolia L. have a longstanding use as traditional herbal remedies that can enhance memory and improve cognitive functions. Pharmacological actions of S. officinalis and S. lavandulaefolia on healthy subjects and on patients suffering of cognitive decline have been investigated. Aim of this review was to summarize published clinical trials assessing effectiveness and safety of S. officinalis and S. lavandulaefolia in the enhancement of cognitive performance in healthy subjects and neurodegenerative illnesses. Furthermore, to purchase a more complete view on safety of S. officinalis and S. lavandulaefolia, we collected and discussed articles regarding toxicity and adverse reactions. Eight clinical studies investigating on acute effects of S. officinalis on healthy subjects were included in the review. Six studies investigated on the effects of S. officinalis and S. lavandaeluaefolia on cognitive performance in healthy subjects. The two remaining were carried out to study the effects of sage on Azheimer's disease. Our review shows that S. officinalis and S. lavandulaefolia exert beneficial effects by enhancing cognitive performance both in healthy subjects and patients with dementia or cognitive impairment and is safe for this indication. Unfortunately, promising beneficial effects are debased by methodological issues, use of different herbal preparations (extracts, essential oil, use of raw material), lack of details on herbal products used. We believe that sage promising effects need further higher methodological standard clinical trials. 
24607960	Mild cognitive impairment and asymptomatic Alzheimer disease subjects: equivalent Î²-amyloid and tau loads with divergent cognitive outcomes.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Apr
Older adults with intact cognition before death and substantial Alzheimer disease (AD) lesions at autopsy have been termed "asymptomatic AD subjects" (ASYMAD). We previously reported hypertrophy of neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli in the CA1 of the hippocampus (CA1), anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and primary visual cortex of ASYMAD versus age-matched Control and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. However, it was unclear whether the neuronal hypertrophy could be attributed to differences in the severity of AD pathology. Here, we performed quantitative analyses of the severity of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) and phosphorylated tau (tau) loads in the brains of ASYMAD, Control, MCI, and AD subjects (n = 15 per group) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Tissue sections from CA1, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and primary visual cortex were immunostained for AÎ² and tau; the respective loads were assessed using unbiased stereology by measuring the fractional areas of immunoreactivity for each protein in each region. The ASYMAD and MCI groups did not differ in AÎ² and tau loads. These data confirm that ASYMAD and MCI subjects have comparable loads of insoluble AÎ² and tau in regions vulnerable to AD pathology despite divergent cognitive outcomes. These findings imply that cognitive impairment in AD may be caused or modulated by factors other than insoluble forms of AÎ² and tau.  
24608097	Plasma phospholipids identify antecedent memory impairment in older adults.
Nat. Med. 20140309 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease causes a progressive dementia that currently affects over 35 million individuals worldwide and is expected to affect 115 million by 2050 (ref. 1). There are no cures or disease-modifying therapies, and this may be due to our inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to produce evident memory loss and functional decline. Biomarkers of preclinical disease will be critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative therapies. Unfortunately, current biomarkers for early disease, including cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-Î² levels, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and the recent use of brain amyloid imaging or inflammaging, are limited because they are either invasive, time-consuming or expensive. Blood-based biomarkers may be a more attractive option, but none can currently detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease with the required sensitivity and specificity. Herein, we describe our lipidomic approach to detecting preclinical Alzheimer's disease in a group of cognitively normal older adults. We discovered and validated a set of ten lipids from peripheral blood that predicted phenoconversion to either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease within a 2-3 year timeframe with over 90% accuracy. This biomarker panel, reflecting cell membrane integrity, may be sensitive to early neurodegeneration of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.  
24567336	The essential role of p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma) and its regulation by FoxO3a transcription factor in Î²-amyloid-induced neuron death.
J. Biol. Chem. 20140224 2014Apr11
Neurodegeneration underlies the pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD). The molecules responsible for such neurodegeneration in AD brain are mostly unknown. Recent findings indicate that the BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family play an essential role in various cell death paradigms, including neurodegeneration. Here we report that Puma (p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), an important member of the BH3-only protein family, is up-regulated in neurons upon toxic Î²-amyloid 1-42 (AÎ²(1-42)) exposure both in vitro and in vivo. Down-regulation of Puma by specific siRNA provides significant protection against neuron death induced by AÎ²(1-42). We further demonstrate that the activation of p53 and inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathways induce Puma. The transcription factor FoxO3a, which is activated when PI3K/Akt signaling is inhibited, directly binds with the Puma gene and induces its expression upon exposure of neurons to oligomeric AÎ²(1-42). Moreover, Puma cooperates with another BH3-only protein, Bim, which is already implicated in AD. Our results thus suggest that Puma is activated by both p53 and PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathways and cooperates with Bim to induce neuron death in response to AÎ²(1-42).  
24799943	Latest Study on the Relationship between Pathological Process of Inflammatory Injury and the Syndrome of Spleen Deficiency and Fluid Retention in Alzheimer's Disease.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140403 2014
Inflammation exists throughout the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) differentiates the pathogenesis of AD as kidney essence deficiency and qi and blood deficiency as well as blood stasis in syndromes, whose action mechanisms are all associated with the intervention in its inflammatory process. Our preliminary studies both in clinic and in vitro have demonstrated that the syndrome of spleen deficiency and fluid retention has also been an important pathogenesis for the incidence and development of AD. Hence, the paper aims to further illustrate the correlation between inflammatory process in AD and the syndrome of spleen deficiency and fluid retention, laying solid foundation for the application of invigorating the spleen and eliminating the dampness in clinic, and enriching the theoretical connotation for AD prevention and treatment in TCM.  
24133287	An algorithmic approach to structural imaging in dementia.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. 20131016 2014Jun
Accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia is important to guide management and provide appropriate information and support to patients and families. Currently, with the exception of individuals with genetic mutations, postmortem examination of brain tissue remains the only definitive means of establishing diagnosis in most cases, however, structural neuroimaging, in combination with clinical assessment, has value in improving diagnostic accuracy during life. Beyond the exclusion of surgical pathology, signal change and cerebral atrophy visible on structural MRI can be used to identify diagnostically relevant imaging features, which provide support for clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. While no structural imaging feature has perfect sensitivity and specificity for a given diagnosis, there are a number of imaging characteristics which provide positive predictive value and help to narrow the differential diagnosis. While neuroradiological expertise is invaluable in accurate scan interpretation, there is much that a non-radiologist can gain from a focused and structured approach to scan analysis. In this article we describe the characteristic MRI findings of the various dementias and provide a structured algorithm with the aim of providing clinicians with a practical guide to assessing scans.  
24263694	Clinical application of 3D arterial spin-labeled brain perfusion imaging for Alzheimer disease: comparison with brain perfusion SPECT.
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 20131121 2014May
Alzheimer disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder with dementia, and a practical and economic biomarker for diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is needed. Three-dimensional arterial spin-labeling, with its high signal-to-noise ratio, enables measurement of cerebral blood flow precisely without any extrinsic tracers. We evaluated the performance of 3D arterial spin-labeling compared with SPECT, and demonstrated the 3D arterial spin-labeled imaging characteristics in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. This study included 68 patients with clinically suspected Alzheimer disease who underwent both 3D arterial spin-labeling and SPECT imaging. Two readers independently assessed both images. Kendall W coefficients of concordance (K) were computed, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed for each reader. The differences between the images in regional perfusion distribution were evaluated by means of statistical parametric mapping, and the incidence of hypoperfusion of the cerebral watershed area, referred to as "borderzone sign" in the 3D arterial spin-labeled images, was determined. Readers showed K = 0.82/0.73 for SPECT/3D arterial spin-labeled imaging, and the respective areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.82/0.69 for reader 1 and 0.80/0.69 for reader 2. Statistical parametric mapping showed that the perisylvian and medial parieto-occipital perfusion in the arterial spin-labeled images was significantly higher than that in the SPECT images. Borderzone sign was observed on 3D arterial spin-labeling in 70% of patients misdiagnosed with Alzheimer disease. The diagnostic performance of 3D arterial spin-labeling and SPECT for Alzheimer disease was almost equivalent. Three-dimensional arterial spin-labeled imaging was more influenced by hemodynamic factors than was SPECT imaging. 
24756818	Determination of Meserine, a new candidate for Alzheimer's disease in mice brain by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and its application to a pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution study.
Anal Bioanal Chem 20140423 2014May
A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for determination of Meserine ((-)-meptazinol phenylcarbamate), a novel potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), was developed, validated, and applied to a pharmacokinetic study in mice brain. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1 ng mL(-1) and the linear range was 1-1,000 ng mL(-1). The analyte was eluted on a Zorbax SB-Aq column (2.1â€‰Ã—â€‰100 mm, 3.5 Î¼m) with the mobile phase composed of methanol and water (70:30, v/v, aqueous phase contained 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.3% formic acid) using isocratic elution, and monitored by positive electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The flow rate was 0.25 mL min(-1). The injection volume was 5 Î¼L and total run time was 4 min. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of intraday and interday variation was 2.49-7.81 and 3.01-7.67%, respectively. All analytes were stable after 4 h at room temperature and 6 h in autosampler. The extraction recoveries of Meserine in brain homogenate were over 90%. The main brain pharmacokinetic parameters obtained after intranasal administration were T maxâ€‰=â€‰0.05 h, C maxâ€‰=â€‰462.0â€‰Â±â€‰39.7 ng g(-1), T 1/2â€‰=â€‰0.4 h, and AUC(0-âˆž)â€‰=â€‰283.1â€‰Â±â€‰9.1 ng h g(-1). Moreover, Meserine was distributed rapidly and widely into brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissue. The method is validated and could be applied to the pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution study of Meserine in mice. 
24702504	Investigational drugs in Alzheimer's disease: current progress.
Expert Opin Investig Drugs 20140405 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Yet, this disease is presently incurable and treatable only in terms of modest delay of symptomatic progression. The need for more effective pharmacological intervention is becoming more pronounced as the patient population increases. This paper outlines and evaluates the current landscape of interventions in early phases of clinical study. Data and analysis for this review were procured from PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, review of posters, abstracts and presentations from American Neurological Association, American Academy of Neurology meetings, Alzheimer's Association International Conference and Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's disease. Keywords and criteria searched included: Phase 0, I, and II trials related to Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-Î², anti-tau, monoclonal antibodies and metabolism. The development of novel pharmacological interventions would be more fruitful if multitarget therapies were introduced, and unexplored mechanisms of action were expanded upon. Additionally, there is a rationale for intervening earlier in the disease, perhaps preceding or at the advent of symptoms. 
24803226	Focusing the amyloid cascade hypothesis on N-truncated Abeta peptides as drug targets against Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Neuropathol. 20140507 2014Jun
Although N-truncated AÎ² variants are known to be the main constituent of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, their potential as targets for pharmacological intervention has only recently been investigated. In the last few years, the Alzheimer field has experienced a paradigm shift with the ever increasing understanding that targeting amyloid plaques has not led to a successful immunotherapy. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that the amyloid cascade hypothesis is central to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, raising the question as to why it is apparently failing to translate into the clinic. In this review, we aim to refocus the amyloid hypothesis integrating N-truncated AÎ² peptides based on mounting evidence that they may represent better targets than full-length AÎ². In addition to AÎ² peptides starting with an Asp at position 1, a variety of different N-truncated AÎ² peptides have been identified starting with amino residue Ala-2, pyroglutamylated Glu-3, Phe-4, Arg-5, His-6, Asp-7, Ser-8, Gly-9, Tyr-10 and pyroglutamylated Glu-11. Certain forms of N-truncated species are better correlates for early pathological changes found pre-symptomatically more often than others. There is also evidence that, together with full-length AÎ², they might be physiologically detectable and are naturally secreted by neurons. Others are known to form soluble aggregates, which have neurotoxic properties in transgenic mouse models. It has been clearly demonstrated by several groups that some N-truncated AÎ²s dominate full-length AÎ² in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. We try to address which of the N-truncated variants may be promising therapeutic targets and which enzymes might be involved in the generation of these peptides.  
24803227	Do current therapeutic anti-AÎ² antibodies for Alzheimer's disease engage the target?
Acta Neuropathol. 20140507 2014Jun
Reducing amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) burden at the pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently the advocated clinical strategy for treating this disease. The most developed method for targeting AÎ² is the use of monoclonal antibodies including bapineuzumab, solanezumab and crenezumab. We have synthesized these antibodies and used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mass spectrometry to characterize and compare the ability of these antibodies to target AÎ² in transgenic mouse tissue as well as human AD tissue. SPR analysis showed that the antibodies were able to bind AÎ² with high affinity. All of the antibodies were able to bind AÎ² in mouse tissue. However, significant differences were observed in human brain tissue. While bapineuzumab was able to capture a variety ofÂ N-terminally truncated AÎ² species, the AÎ² detected using solanezumab was barely above detection limits while crenezumab did not detect any AÎ². None of the antibodies were able to detect any AÎ² species in human blood. Immunoprecipitation experiments using plasma from AD subjects showed that both solanezumab and crenezumab have extensive cross-reactivity with non-AÎ² related proteins. Bapineuzumab demonstrated target engagement with brain AÎ², consistent with published clinical data. Solanezumab and crenezumab did not, most likely as a result of a lack of specificity due to cross-reactivity with other proteins containing epitope overlap. This lack of target engagement raises questions as to whether solanezumab and crenezumab are suitable drug candidates for the preventative clinical trials for AD.  
24936186	Cellular stress response, redox status, and vitagenes in glaucoma: a systemic oxidant disorder linked to Alzheimer's disease.
Front Pharmacol 20140606 2014
Amyloid deposits, constituted of amyloid beta (AÎ²) aggregates, are a characteristic feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease. They also have been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of retinal damage, as well as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by gradual degeneration of neuronal tissue due to retinal ganglion cell loss, associated to visual field loss over time resulting in irreversible blindness. Accumulation of AÎ² characterizes glaucoma as a protein misfolding disease, suggesting a pathogenic role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of retinal degenerative damage associated to glaucoma. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating a link between Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Further, several heat shock proteins (HSPs) members have been implicated both in neurodegenerative diseases and glaucomatous apoptosis. To maintain redox homeostasis vitagenes, as integrated mechanisms, operate actively to preserve cell survival under condition of stress. Vitagenes encode for sirtuin, thioredoxin and HSPs. The present study was designed to investigate cellular stress response mechanisms in the blood of patients with glaucoma, compared to control subjects. Levels of vitagenes HSP-72, heme oxygenase-1, as well as F2-isoprostanes were significantly higher in the blood of patients with glaucoma than in controls. Furthermore, in the same experimental group increased expression of Trx and sirtuin 1 were measured. Our results sustain the importance of redox homeostasis disruption in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and highlights the opportunity that new therapies that prevents neurodegeneration through non-immunomodulatory mechanisms might be synergistically associated with current glaucoma therapies, thus unraveling important targets for novel cytoprotective strategies.  
24936423	Longitudinal deformation models, spatial regularizations and learning strategies to quantify Alzheimer's disease progression.
Neuroimage Clin 20140401 2014
In the context of Alzheimer's disease, two challenging issues are (1) the characterization of local hippocampal shape changes specific to disease progression and (2) the identification of mild-cognitive impairment patients likely to convert. In the literature, (1) is usually solved first to detect areas potentially related to the disease. These areas are then considered as an input to solve (2). As an alternative to this sequential strategy, we investigate the use of a classification model using logistic regression to address both issues (1) and (2) simultaneously. The classification of the patients therefore does not require any a priori definition of the most representative hippocampal areas potentially related to the disease, as they are automatically detected. We first quantify deformations of patients' hippocampi between two time points using the large deformations by diffeomorphisms framework and transport these deformations to a common template. Since the deformations are expected to be spatially structured, we perform classification combining logistic loss and spatial regularization techniques, which have not been explored so far in this context, as far as we know. The main contribution of this paper is the comparison of regularization techniques enforcing the coefficient maps to be spatially smooth (Sobolev), piecewise constant (total variation) or sparse (fused LASSO) with standard regularization techniques which do not take into account the spatial structure (LASSO, ridge and ElasticNet). On a dataset of 103 patients out of ADNI, the techniques using spatial regularizations lead to the best classification rates. They also find coherent areas related to the disease progression.  
24936424	White matter microstructure in late middle-age: Effects of apolipoprotein E4 and parental family history of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroimage Clin 20140421 2014
Little is still known about the effects of risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) on white matter microstructure in cognitively healthy adults. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess the effect of two well-known risk factors for AD, parental family history and APOE4 genotype. This study included 343 participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, who underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). A region of interest analysis was performed on fractional anisotropy maps, in addition to mean, radial, and axial diffusivity maps, aligned to a common template space using a diffeomorphic, tensor-based registration method. The analysis focused on brain regions known to be affected in AD including the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus. Analyses assessed the impact of APOE4, parental family history of AD, age, and sex on white matter microstructure in late middle-aged participants (aged 47-76Â years). Both APOE4 and parental family history were associated with microstructural white matter differences. Participants with parental family history of AD had higher FA in the genu of the corpus callosum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. We observed an interaction between family history and APOE4, where participants who were family history positive but APOE4 negative had lower axial diffusivity in the uncinate fasciculus, and participants who were both family history positive and APOE4 positive had higher axial diffusivity in this region. We also observed an interaction between APOE4 and age, whereby older participants (=65Â years of age) who were APOE4 carriers, had higher MD in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and in the portion of the cingulum bundle running adjacent to the cingulate cortex, compared to non-carriers. Older participants who were APOE4 carriers also showed higher radial diffusivity in the genu compared to non-carriers. Across all participants, age had an effect on FA, MD, and axial and radial diffusivities. Sex differences were observed in FA and radial diffusivity. APOE4 genotype, parental family history of AD, age, and sex are all associated with microstructural white matter differences in late middle-aged adults. In participants at risk for AD, alterations in diffusion characteristics-both expected and unexpected-may represent cellular changes occurring at the earliest disease stages, but further work is needed. Higher mean, radial, and axial diffusivities were observed in participants who are more likely to be experiencing later stage preclinical pathology, including participants who were both older and carried APOE4, or whoÂ wereÂ positiveÂ forÂ bothÂ APOE4Â andÂ parentalÂ familyÂ historyÂ ofÂ AD. 
24936411	Associations between white matter microstructure and amyloid burden in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: A multimodal imaging investigation.
Neuroimage Clin 20140219 2014
Some cognitively healthy individuals develop brain amyloid accumulation, suggestive of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the effect of amyloid on other potentially informative imaging modalities, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), in characterizing brain changes in preclinical AD requires further exploration. In this study, a sample (NÂ =Â 139, mean age 60.6, range 46 to 71) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), a cohort enriched for AD risk factors, was recruited for a multimodal imaging investigation that included DTI and [C-11]Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). Participants were grouped as amyloid positive (AÎ²+), amyloid indeterminate (AÎ²i), or amyloid negative (AÎ²-) based on the amount and pattern of amyloid deposition. Regional voxel-wise analyses of four DTI metrics, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (Da), and radial diffusivity (Dr), were performed based on amyloid grouping. Three regions of interest (ROIs), the cingulum adjacent to the corpus callosum, hippocampal cingulum, and lateral fornix, were selected based on their involvement in the early stages of AD. Voxel-wise analysis revealed higher FA among AÎ²+ compared to AÎ²- in all three ROIs and in AÎ²i compared to AÎ²- in the cingulum adjacent to the corpus callosum. Follow-up exploratory whole-brain analyses were consistent with the ROI findings, revealing multiple regions where higher FA was associated with greater amyloid. Lower fronto-lateral gray matter MD was associated with higher amyloid burden. Further investigation showed a negative correlation between MD and PiB signal, suggesting that AÎ² accumulation impairs diffusion. Interestingly, these findings in a largely presymptomatic sample are in contradistinction to relationships reported in the literature in symptomatic disease stages of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD, which usually show higher MD and lower FA. Together with analyses showing that cognitive function in these participants is not associated with any of the four DTI metrics, the present results suggest an early relationship between PiB and DTI, which may be a meaningful indicator of the initiating or compensatory mechanisms of AD prior to cognitive decline.  
24788298	Specificity of anti-tau antibodies when analyzing mice models of Alzheimer's disease: problems and solutions.
PLoS ONE 20140502 2014
Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are found in a group of diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimer's disease. The causes and consequences of tau hyperphosphorylation are routinely investigated in laboratory animals. Mice are the models of choice as they are easily amenable to transgenic technology; consequently, their tau phosphorylation levels are frequently monitored by Western blotting using a panel of monoclonal/polyclonal anti-tau antibodies. Given that mouse secondary antibodies can recognize endogenous mouse immunoglobulins (Igs) and the possible lack of specificity with some polyclonal antibodies, non-specific signals are commonly observed. Here, we characterized the profiles of commonly used anti-tau antibodies in four different mouse models: non-transgenic mice, tau knock-out (TKO) mice, 3xTg-AD mice, and hypothermic mice, the latter a positive control for tau hyperphosphorylation. We identified 3 tau monoclonal antibody categories: type 1, characterized by high non-specificity (AT8, AT180, MC1, MC6, TG-3), type 2, demonstrating low non-specificity (AT270, CP13, CP27, Tau12, TG5), and type 3, with no non-specific signal (DA9, PHF-1, Tau1, Tau46). For polyclonal anti-tau antibodies, some displayed non-specificity (pS262, pS409) while others did not (pS199, pT205, pS396, pS404, pS422, A0024). With monoclonal antibodies, most of the interfering signal was due to endogenous Igs and could be eliminated by different techniques: i) using secondary antibodies designed to bind only non-denatured Igs, ii) preparation of a heat-stable fraction, iii) clearing Igs from the homogenates, and iv) using secondary antibodies that only bind the light chain of Igs. All of these techniques removed the non-specific signal; however, the first and the last methods were easier and more reliable. Overall, our study demonstrates a high risk of artefactual signal when performing Western blotting with routinely used anti-tau antibodies, and proposes several solutions to avoid non-specific results. We strongly recommend the use of negative (i.e., TKO) and positive (i.e., hypothermic) controls in all experiments. 
23727128	Alzheimer's disease: review of hormone therapy trials and implications for treatment and prevention after menopause.
J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 20130528 2014Jul
Hormonal changes associated with the menopausal transition and postmenopause have the potential to influence processes linked to Alzheimer's disease symptoms and pathogenesis, but effects of menopause on Alzheimer risk can be addressed only indirectly. Nine randomized clinical trials of estrogen-containing hormone therapy in Alzheimer's disease patients were identified by a systematic literature search. Findings suggest that hormone therapy does not improve cognitive symptoms of women with Alzheimer's disease. No clinical trials of hormone therapy address Alzheimer prevention, but one clinical trial provides moderate evidence that continuous, combined estrogen plus progestogen initiated at age 65 years or older increases the risk of dementia. The timing, or critical window, hypothesis suggests that hormone therapy initiated at a younger age in closer temporal proximity to menopause may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. This hypothesis is supported by observational research but is not addressed by clinical trial data. Unrecognized confounding is of concern in interpreting observational results, and research that helps resolve this issue will have important public health implications. Well-designed cohort studies, convergent evidence from appropriate laboratory models, and long-term clinical trials using surrogate biomarkers of brain function and neural pathology could provide relevant answers. Other estrogenic compounds are of theoretical interest with respect to Alzheimer treatment and risk. Effects of selective estrogen receptor modulators such as raloxifene may differ from those of estrogens; potential effects of phytoestrogens are not well studied. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Menopause'.  
24176763	Pharmacology of conjugated equine estrogens: efficacy, safety and mechanism of action.
J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 20131028 2014Jul
Oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) are the most used estrogen formulation for postmenopausal hormone therapy either alone or in combination with a progestin. CEE is most commonly used for the management of early menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginitis, insomnia, and mood disturbances. Additionally, if used at the start of the menopausal phase (age 50-59 years), CEE prevents osteoporosis and may in some women reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). There appears to be a common mechanism through which estrogens can protect against CVD and AD. CEE is a natural formulation of an extract prepared from pregnant mares' urine. The product monogram lists the presence of only 10 estrogens consisting of the classical estrogens, estrone and 17Î²-estradiol, and a group of unique ring B unsaturated estrogens such as equilin and equilenin. The ring B unsaturated estrogens are formed by an alternate steroidogenic pathway in which cholesterol is not an obligatory intermediate. Both the route of administration and structure of these estrogens play a role in the overall pharmacology of CEE. In contrast to 17Î²-estradiol, ring B unsaturated estrogens express their biological effects mainly mediated by the estrogen receptor Î² and not the estrogen receptor Î±. All estrogen components of CEE are antioxidants, and some ring B unsaturated estrogens have several fold greater antioxidant activity than estrone and 17Î²-estradiol. The cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects of CEE appear to be, to some extent, due to its ability to prevent the formation of oxidized LDL and HDL, and by inhibiting or modulating some of the key proteases involved in programmed cell death (apoptosis) induced by the excess neurotransmitter glutamate and other neurotoxins. Selective combinations of ring B unsaturated estrogens have the potential of being developed as novel therapeutic agents for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease in both aging women and men. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Menopause'.  
23859546	The effects of soluble AÎ² oligomers on neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr. Pharm. Des.  2014
The neurodegenerative process that defines Alzheimer''s disease (AD) is initially characterized by synaptic alterations followed by synapse loss and ultimately cell death. Decreased synaptic density that precedes neuronal death is the strongest pathological correlate of cognitive deficits observed in AD. Substantial synapse and neuron loss occur early in disease progression in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the CA1 region of the hippocampus, when memory deficits become clinically detectable. Mounting evidence suggests that soluble amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) oligomers trigger synapse dysfunction both in vitro and in vivo. However, the neurodegenerative effect of AÎ² species observed on neuronal culture or organotypic brain slice culture has been more challenging to mimic in animal models. While most of the transgenic mice that overexpress AÎ² show abundant amyloid plaque pathology and early synaptic alterations, these models have been less successful in recapitulating the spatiotemporal pattern of cell loss observed in AD. Recently we developed a novel animal model that revealed the neurodegenerative effect of soluble low-molecular-weight AÎ² oligomers in vivo. This new approach may now serve to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking soluble AÎ² species to neurodegeneration in animals. In light of the low efficiency of AD therapies based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, a novel framework, the aging factor cascade hypothesis, is proposed in an attempt to integrate the new data and concepts that emerged from recent research to develop disease modifying therapies. 
23948933	Analysis of HSPA8 and HSPA9 mRNA expression and promoter methylation in the brain and blood of Alzheimer's disease patients.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly. Chaperones may have a crucial role in AD due to their involvement in protein quality control, folding, and degradation. In this study, we investigated the mRNA and promoter DNA methylation levels of two chaperones, HSPA8 and HSPA9, in postmortem brain tissue (entorhinal and auditory cortices and hippocampus) from healthy elderly and AD subjects as well as in peripheral blood of healthy elderly and AD patients. mRNA quantification was performed by qRT-PCR and DNA methylation by mass spectrometry. In the peripheral blood, we did not observe a significant difference in HSPA8 and HSPA9 expression between elderly controls and AD. A significant downregulation of HSPA8 and HSPA9 was observed in AD across the three brain regions compared to the controls, suggesting their participation in AD pathogenesis. However, no important DNA methylation differences were observed, suggesting that other mechanism may be involved in controlling these genes expression.  
24276217	Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the risk for dementia: the Framingham Heart Study.
JAMA Neurol  2014Jan
In animal studies, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to impact neuronal survival and function and improve synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Circulating BDNF levels increase with physical activity and caloric restriction, thus BDNF may mediate some of the observed associations between lifestyle and the risk for dementia. Some prior studies showed lower circulating BDNF in persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) compared with control participants; however, it remains uncertain whether reduced levels precede dementia onset. To examine whether higher serum BDNF levels in cognitively healthy adults protect against the future risk for dementia and AD and to identify potential modifiers of this association. Framingham Study original and offspring participants were followed up from 1992 and 1998, respectively, for up to 10 years. We used Cox models to relate BDNF levels to the risk for dementia and AD and adjusted for potential confounders. We also ran sensitivity analyses stratified by sex, age, and education, as well as related BDNF genetic variants to AD risk. This community-based, prospective cohort study involved 2131 dementia-free participants aged 60 years and older (mean [SD] age, 72 [7] years; 56% women). Ten-year incidence of dementia and AD. During follow-up, 140 participants developed dementia, 117 of whom had AD. Controlling for age and sex, each standard-deviation increment in BDNF was associated with a 33% lower risk for dementia and AD (Pâ€‰=â€‰.006 and Pâ€‰=â€‰.01, respectively) and these associations persisted after additional adjustments. Compared with the bottom quintile, BDNF levels in the top quintile were associated with less than half the risk for dementia and AD (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.85; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01; and hazard ratio,â€‰0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.86; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02, respectively). These associations were apparent only among women, persons aged 80 years and older, and those with college degrees (hazard ratios for AD: 0.65, [95% CI, 0.50-0.85], Pâ€‰=â€‰.001; 0.63 [95% CI, 0.47-0.85], Pâ€‰=â€‰.002; and 0.27 [95% CI, 0.11-0.65], Pâ€‰=â€‰.003, respectively). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor genetic variants were not associated with AD risk. Higher serum BDNF levels may protect against future occurrence of dementia and AD. Our findings suggest a role for BDNF in the biology and possibly in the prevention of dementia and AD, especially in select subgroups of women and older and more highly educated persons. 
24383913	Bexarotene blocks calcium-permeable ion channels formed by neurotoxic Alzheimer's Î²-amyloid peptides.
ACS Chem Neurosci 20140112 2014Mar19
The anticancer drug bexarotene has been shown to restore cognitive functions in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, but its exact mechanism of action remains elusive. In the present report, we have used a combination of molecular, physicochemical, and cellular approaches to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-Alzheimer properties of bexarotene in neural cells. First of all, we noticed that bexarotene shares a structural analogy with cholesterol. We showed that cholesterol and bexarotene compete for the same binding site in the C-terminal region of Alzheimer's Î²-amyloid peptide 1-42 (AÎ²1-42). This common bexarotene/cholesterol binding domain was characterized as a linear motif encompassing amino acid residues 25-35 of AÎ²1-42. Because cholesterol is involved in the oligomerization of Alzheimer's Î²-amyloid peptides into neurotoxic amyloid channels, we studied the capability of bexarotene to interfere with this process. We showed that nanomolar concentrations of bexarotene efficiently prevented the cholesterol-dependent increase of calcium fluxes induced by Î²-amyloid peptides AÎ²1-42 and AÎ²25-35 in SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting a direct effect of the drug on amyloid channel formation. Molecular dynamics simulations gave structural insights into the role of cholesterol in amyloid channel formation and explained the inhibitory effect of bexarotene. Because it is the first drug that can both inhibit the binding of cholesterol to Î²-amyloid peptides and prevent calcium-permeable amyloid pore formation in the plasma membrane of neural cells, bexarotene might be considered as the prototype of a new class of anti-Alzheimer compounds. The experimental approach developed herein can be used as a screening strategy to identify such compounds.  
24706297	Effect of topiramate on apoptosis-related protein expression of hippocampus in model rats with Alzheimers disease.
Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci  2014
Alzheimer's disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disease and a synaptic function defect disease, the clinical symptoms are mainly progressive cognitive impairment, affecting patient's social function. Aim of this report was to investigate the effect of topiramate on apoptosis-related protein expression (Bcl-2, Survivin, Fas, Bax and Caspase-3) in the hippocampus of a rat model with Alzheimers Disease (AD). Thirty-six adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control group, a model group and a test group. A dose of amyloid beta-protein 1-40 (AÎ²1-40) was injected into the hippocampus of the rats in the model and test groups, and the control rats are injected with same amount of saline. After AD model was successfully established, the rats in each group were administrated with an i.p. injection of topiramate (20 mg/kg/d) for 30 days. The effect of topiramate on the apoptosis-related protein levels in hippocampus neurons was studied by immunohistochemistry. The number of Bcl-2 and Survivin positive cells and optical density in hippocampus of rats in test group was more than those of rats in model groups, but less than those of rats in control group (p &lt; 0.01); Fas, Bax and Caspase-3 positive cells and optical density in hippocampus of rats in test group was less than those of rats in the model group, but more than those of rats in control group (p &lt; 0.01). Alzheimer's disease can induce apoptosis of hippocampus neurons in rats. Topiramate can prevent apoptosis of hippocampus neurons, at least in part, by increasing expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin and decreasing expression of Fas, Bax and Caspase-3. 
24623839	Incidence of cerebral microbleeds in preclinical Alzheimer disease.
Neurology 20140312 2014Apr8
We sought to determine the incidence and associations of lobar microbleeds (LMBs) in a longitudinal cohort with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging. One hundred seventy-four participants from the observational Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (97 with normal cognition [NC], 37 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 40 with Alzheimer disease [AD] dementia) were assessed at 3 time points over 3 years with 3-tesla susceptibility-weighted MRI and (11)C-PiB PET. MRIs were inspected for microbleeds, siderosis, infarction, and white matter hyperintensity severity, blind to clinical and PiB findings. Neocortical PiB standardized uptake value ratio, normalized to cerebellar cortex, was dichotomized as positive or negative (PiB+/-, standardized uptake value ratio &gt;1.5). Annualized LMB incidence was calculated, and logistic regression was used to determine the association of incident LMBs with PiB, APOE Îµ4+ status, and cerebrovascular disease. LMBs were present in 18.6% of NC, 24.3% of MCI, and 40% of AD participants (p &lt; 0.05 vs NC). LMB incidence was 0.2 Â± 0.6 per year in NC participants, 0.2 Â± 0.5 in MCI, and 0.7 Â± 1.4 in AD (p &lt; 0.03 vs NC) and was 6-fold higher in PiB+ than PiB-NC. Incident LMBs were associated with age, APOE Îµ4+, PiB+, and baseline LMBs. Incidence of multiple LMBs was also associated with lacunar infarction and white matter hyperintensity severity. Older age, baseline LMBs, higher Î²-amyloid burden, and concomitant cerebrovascular disease may all confer higher risk of incident LMBs. This should be considered when designing protocols for amyloid-modifying clinical trials. 
24714617	Serum uric acid levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.
PLoS ONE 20140408 2014
Serum uric acid (UA) could exert neuro-protective effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) via its antioxidant capacities. Many studies investigated serum UA levels in AD patients, but to date, results from these observational studies are conflicting. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare serum UA levels between AD patients and healthy controls by the random-effects model. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library databases from 1966 through July 2013 using the Medical Subject Headings and keywords without restriction in languages. Only case-control studies were included if they had data on serum UA levels in AD patients and healthy controls. Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test were applied to assess the potential publication bias. Sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were conducted to explore possible explanations for heterogeneity. A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria including 2708 participants were abstracted. Serum UA levels were not significantly different in AD patients compared to healthy controls (standardized mean difference (SMD)â€Š=â€Š-0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.23 to 0.22). Little evidence of publication bias was observed. Sensitivity analyses showed that the combined SMD was consistent every time omitting any one study, except only one study which greatly influenced the overall results. Meta-regression showed that year of publication, race, sample size, and mean age were not significant sources of heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis of case-control studies suggests that serum UA levels do not differ significantly in AD patients, but there may be a trend toward decreased UA in AD after an appropriate interpretation. More well-designed investigations are needed to demonstrate the potential change of serum UA levels in AD patients. 
24687588	Analysis of verbal fluency ability in Alzheimer's disease: the role of clustering, switching and semantic proximities.
Arch Clin Neuropsychol 20140330 2014May
The underlying nature of verbal fluency deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was investigated in this study. Participants were 48 individuals with AD and 48 cognitively healthy older adults. Fluency performance on letter and category tasks was analyzed across two 30-s intervals for total words produced, mean cluster size, and total switches. Compared with the control group, AD participants produced fewer words and switches on both fluency tasks and had a reduced category cluster size. The AD group was differentially impaired on category compared with letter fluency and produced more repetitive responses but fewer category exemplars than controls on the category task. A multidimensional scaling approach revealed that AD participants' semantic maps were similar to controls. Overall, the data suggest that executive abilities involving search and retrieval processes and a reduced availability of semantically related words contributed to the AD group's poorer performance despite similar temporal recall and organizational patterns.  
24806343	Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease analysis by mass spectrometry-based proteomics.
Int J Mol Sci 20140506 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common chronic and destructive disease. The early diagnosis of AD is difficult, thus the need for clinically applicable biomarkers development is growing rapidly. There are many methods to biomarker discovery and identification. In this review, we aim to summarize Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics studies on AD and discuss thoroughly the methods to identify candidate biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. This review will also discuss the potential research areas on biomarkers.  
24822221	Correlated inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in peptide-injected animal models of Alzheimer's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140413 2014
Animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which emphasize activation of microglia may have particular utility in correlating proinflammatory activity with neurodegeneration. This paper reviews injection of amyloid- Î² (A Î² ) into rat brain as an alternative AD animal model to the use of transgenic animals. In particular, intrahippocampal injection of AÎ² 1-42 peptide demonstrates prominent microglial mobilization and activation accompanied by a significant loss of granule cell neurons. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory reactivity is demonstrated by a broad spectrum of drugs with a common endpoint in conferring neuroprotection in peptide-injected animals. Peptide-injection models provide a focus on glial cell responses to direct peptide injection in rat brain and offer advantages in the study of the mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation in AD brain.  
23314063	Olfactory deficit and hippocampal volume loss for early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease: a pilot study.

The aim of this pilot study was to verify the role of olfactory test and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging measure of hippocampus to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease (AD). Eighteen patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment, broadly defined, were followed at 12 months. Hypothesized baseline predictors for follow-up conversion to AD were olfactory deficit and hippocampal volumes loss. In the 1-year follow-up, 5 patients converted to AD. The 2 clinical predictors olfactory test and hippocampal volume loss showed the same sensitivity of 92.3% but the olfactory test showed a higher specificity than the hippocampal volume loss (75% vs. 60%). Our findings suggest the potential utility of olfactory test and hippocampal volume loss for early detection of AD. 
24077018	Neuropsychological deficits associated with route learning in Alzheimer disease, MCI, and normal aging.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Apr-Jun
The background of route learning (RL) abilities in Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal aging needs further study. We searched for neuropsychological and demographical predictors of RL impairment. RL was investigated in a clinical study including subjects classified as early AD (n=37), MCI (n=34), and aged normal controls (n=46). An ecological assessment procedure of RL was employed and landmarks learning and navigational abilities were evaluated. The consortium to establish a registry of Alzheimer's disease test battery was used for neuropsychological assessment. Almost all AD patients, and most subjects with MCI misidentified landmarks and made navigational errors when following the route without assistance. Moreover, a small subgroup of normal controls also had problems with RL. Poor RL performance was best predicted by impairments in memory and executive functions. RL impairment is common in early AD and MCI, and is occasionally also found in normal elderly subjects. Its characteristic appearance is a combination of poor landmark recognition and defective directional guidance. Poor RL can be predicted by neuropsychological testing. In MCI and in a subset of normal aged persons, RL impairment may herald incipient dementia. 
24113560	A complex association of ABCA7 genotypes with sporadic Alzheimer disease in Chinese Han population.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Apr-Jun
Recently, a large genome-wide association study has revealed that polymorphism of alleles and genotypes in rs3,764,650 within ABCA7 gene is associated with Alzheimer disease in whites. We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether these susceptible genetic variants are risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer disease (SAD) in Chinese Han population. A total of 633 participants consisting of 350 SAD and 283 nondemented elderly controls matched for sex and age were recruited and genetic variants in ABCA7 (rs3,764,650) were genotyped using DNA sequencing. On the basis of allele and genotype frequencies in both groups, we found a significant association (P=0.004) between ABCA7 genotypes and SAD in Chinese Han population, and the results were influenced by age and ApoEÎµ4 status. ApoEÎµ4-carrier and aging are linked to enhancing ABCA7 risk-associated SAD. However, the prevalence of the minor allele G in rs3,764,650 within ABCA7 showed no significant difference between the 2 groups in this study. ABCA7 (rs3,764,650) was associated with SAD in the Chinese population, with both ApoEÎµ4-carrier and aging being factors enhancing its risk. 
24728903	Dihydromyricetin ameliorates behavioral deficits and reverses neuropathology of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurochem. Res. 20140413 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading progressive neurodegenerative disorder afflicting 35.6 million people worldwide. There is no therapeutic agent that can slow or stop the progression of AD. Human studies show that besides loss of cognition/learning ability, neuropsychological symptoms such as anxiety and seizures are seen as high as 70 and 17Â % respectively in AD patients, suggesting dysfunction of GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to pathogenesis of AD. Dihydromyricetin (DHM) is a plant flavonoid and a positive allosteric modulator of GABAARs we developed recently (Shen et al. in J Neurosci 32(1):390-401, 2012 [1]). In this study, transgenic (TG2576) and Swedish transgenic (TG-SwDI) mice with AD-like pathology were treated with DHM (2Â mg/kg) for 3Â months. Behaviorally, DHM-treated mice show improved cognition, reduced anxiety level and seizure susceptibility. Pathologically, DHM has high efficacy to reduce amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides in TG-SwDI brain. Further, patch-clamp recordings from dentate gyrus neurons in hippocampal slices from TG-SwDI mice showed reduced frequency and amplitude of GABAAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, and decreased extrasynaptic tonic inhibitory current, while DHM restored these GABAAR-mediated currents in TG-SwDI. We found that gephyrin, a postsynaptic GABAAR anchor protein that regulates the formation and plasticity of GABAergic synapses, decreased in hippocampus and cortex in TG-SwDI. DHM treatment restored gephyrin levels. These results suggest that DHM treatment not only improves symptoms, but also reverses progressive neuropathology of mouse models of AD including reducing AÎ² peptides, while restoring gephyrin levels, GABAergic transmission and functional synapses. Therefore DHM is a promising candidate medication for AD. We propose a novel target, gephyrin, for treatment of AD.  
24830360	The effect of APOE Îµ4 allele on cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with Alzheimer disease: evaluation of the feasibility of resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Apr-Jun
This work is to determine whether apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modulates the effect of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment on resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). We retrospectively studied very mild and mild AD participants who were treated (N=25) or untreated (N=19) with ChEIs with respect to rs-fcMRI measure of 5 resting state networks (RSNs): default mode, dorsal attention (DAN), control (CON), salience (SAL), and sensory motor. For each network, a composite score was computed as the mean of Pearson correlations between pairwise time courses extracted from areas comprising this network. The composite scores were analyzed as a function of ChEI treatment and APOE Îµ4 allele. Across all participants, significant interactions between ChEI treatment and APOE Îµ4 allele were observed for all 5 RSNs. Within APOE Îµ4 carriers, significantly greater composite scores were observed in the DAN, CON, and SAL for treated compared with untreated participants. Within APOE Îµ4 noncarriers, treated and untreated participants did not have significantly different composite scores for all RSNs. These data suggest that APOE genotype affects the response to ChEI using rs-fcMRI. Rs-fcMRI may be useful for assessing the therapeutic effect of medications in AD clinical trials.  
23948924	Evidence for the efficacy of latrepirdine (Dimebon) treatment for improvement of cognitive function: a meta-analysis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Over the last few years, latrepirdine, a dÃ©modÃ© antihistamine drug, has been proposed to be useful for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, and more recently schizophrenia. The mechanisms and pharmacological targets that are responsible for the beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases remain unknown. But it has been proposed that latrepirdine may modulate several targets including voltage-gate Ca+2 channels, mitochondrial permeability pore transition, or several neurotransmitter receptors. Herein, we present a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to ascertain the efficacy and safety of latrepirdine on cognitive function. By doing a search in electronic databases, we found five clinical trials in which the effect of latrepirdine on cognition function has been studied, and this was evaluated using MMSE, ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and NPI scores. Latrepirdine generally presented a good safety profile; it was well tolerated when given alone or in combination with a variety of other drugs. We observed heterogeneous results between trials; latrepirdine failed to exert a significant beneficial effect although it tended to improve cognitive scores. The only significant benefit that we found was for the NPI score in Alzheimer's disease patients.  
23948928	Using cerebrospinal fluid marker profiles in clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is difficult to differentiate from other neuro-degenerative diseases. Patients are often mistaken to suffer from Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the overlapping clinical appearances concerning cognition and movement. We investigated the possibility for a valid differential diagnosis using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. In the context of a large retrospective study, we analyzed data of patients suffering from degenerative, ischemic, or inflammatory CNS (central nervous system) diseases and identified those with DLB (n = 34), PD (n = 37), and AD (n = 47) for further analyses. We detected abnormalities in the CSF profiles of those patients with DLB while using a combination of decreased amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)42 and increased tau levels. By stratification of data by disease severity, we observed a high sensitivity of this combination especially in the subgroup of patients with advanced stages, while the sensitivity in early forms was lower. In addition, with clinical deterioration, the abnormalities in the CSF profile became more pronounced. We conclude that DLB can be distinguished from PD, in spite of both being synucleinopathies, by CSF profiles using neurodegenerative marker analysis. The pathophysiology of increased tau and decreased AÎ² levels in those conditions has to be elucidated further, since both proteins are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, but no clear explanation has been postulated for DLB yet. 
23948932	Hippocampal neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease: is there a role for dietary modulation?
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis have been recognized as an integral part of Alzheimer's disease. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors; one of them is diet. This review provides an assessment of the current state of the field in hippocampal neurogenesis studies in Alzheimer's disease and focuses on the role of diet. The review highlights some of the key dietary compounds and interventions such as calorie restriction, fat, polyphenols, zinc, folate, alcohol and thiamine, and emphasizes the pathways that they modify.  
23948934	Early clinical PET imaging results with the novel PHF-tau radioligand [F18]-T808.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau (PHF-tau), such as neurofibrillary tangles, are linked to the degree of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. We have recently reported early clinical results of a novel PHF-tau targeting PET imaging agent, [F18]-T807. Since then, we have investigated a second novel PHF-tau targeting PET imaging agent, [F18]-T808, with different pharmacokinetic characteristics, which may be favorable for imaging Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Here, we describe the first human brain images with [F18]-T808.  
23948936	Multiple microbleeds are related to cerebral network disruptions in patients with early Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Cerebral microbleeds are a manifestation of small vessel disease and are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their clinical significance in this condition is uncertain. We hypothesized that microbleeds contribute to disturbances of the cerebral network in AD and as such may affect cognition. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between microbleeds and brain networks in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or early AD. Sixty-seven patients (77.9 Â± 7.5 years) with aMCI (n = 29) or early AD (n = 38) underwent cognitive testing and 3Tesla MRI. Microbleeds were rated visually. Diffusion tensor imaging and graph theoretical analysis were used to reconstruct brain networks and to quantify network efficiency for each patient. Network measures were compared between patients without and with â‰¥1 microbleeds and between patients without or with â‰¥3 microbleeds. In secondary analyses, cognitive functioning was compared between groups. Analyses were adjusted for age and gender, and additionally for other markers of small vessel disease and atrophy. Network measures did not differ between patients with â‰¥1 microbleed (n = 26) and patients without microbleeds (n = 41). However, patients with â‰¥3 microbleeds (n = 11) showed significant white matter disruptions, longer path length, and less global efficiency than patients without microbleeds, independent of other markers of small vessel disease and atrophy. Cognitive functioning did not differ between patients without microbleeds and patients with â‰¥1 or â‰¥3 microbleeds. Multiple microbleeds are related to structural network disruption in patients with early AD, but their direct impact on cognitive functioning appears to be limited. 
23948939	The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health: keeping memory alive.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health (LRCBH) is a unique clinical and translational research enterprise that stems from the passion of Larry Ruvo to honor his father, Lou, a victim of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To attract national attention to AD, Mr. Ruvo convinced architect Frank Gehry to construct the remarkable building complex of the LRCBH in Las Vegas, Nevada. Cleveland Clinic assumed responsibility for running the clinical and research aspects of the LRCBH. The care provided in this novel architectural setting is innovative and emphasizes patients first care with integration of caregiver programs and clinical research opportunities. Standardization of care, outcomes measures, and process metrics provide a platform for assessing, studying, and exporting best practices in cognitive care. Clinical trials empower patients to help solve the diseases that afflict them. The combination of a passionate founder, dramatic architecture, clinical excellence, integrated care partner programs, and commitment to development of next generation treatments makes the LRCBH a unique model of integrated care and research.  
24077430	Sleep in frontotemporal dementia is equally or possibly more disrupted, and at an earlier stage, when compared to sleep in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Conversely to other neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, AD), sleep in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has not been studied adequately. Although some evidence exists that sleep-wake disturbances occur in FTD, very little is known regarding sleep macrostructure and/or primary sleep disorders. To investigate these issues in this population and compare them to similar issues in AD and in healthy elderly (HE). Twelve drug-naÃ¯ve behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD) patients (7 men/5 women) of mean age 62.5 Â± 8.6 years were compared to seventeen drug-naÃ¯ve AD patients (8 men/9 women) of mean age 69.0 Â± 9.9 years and twenty drug-naÃ¯ve HE (12 men/8 women) of mean age 70.2 Â± 12.5 years. All participants were fully assessed clinically, through a sleep questionnaire, an interview, and video-polysomnography recordings. The two patient groups were comparably cognitively impaired. However, compared to FTD patients, the AD patients had a statistically significant longer disease duration. Overall, the sleep profile was better preserved in HE. Sleep complaints did not differ considerably between the two patient groups. Sleep parameters and sleep macrostructure were better preserved in AD compared to FTD patients, regardless of primary sleep disorders, which occurred equally in the two groups. With respect to AD, FTD patients had several sleep parameters similarly or even more affected by neurodegeneration, but in a much shorter time span. The findings probably indicate a centrally originating sleep deregulation. Since in FTD patients sleep disturbances may be obvious from an early stage of their disease, and possibly earlier than in AD patients, physicians and caregivers should be alert for the early detection and treatment of these symptoms. 
24077433	Genetic interactions within inositol-related pathways are associated with longitudinal changes in ventricle size.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The genetic etiology of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has proven complex, involving clinical and genetic heterogeneity and gene-gene interactions. Recent genome wide association studies in LOAD have led to the discovery of novel genetic risk factors; however, the investigation of gene-gene interactions has been limited. Conventional genetic studies often use binary disease status as the primary phenotype, but for complex brain-based diseases, neuroimaging data can serve as quantitative endophenotypes that correlate with disease status and closely reflect pathological changes. In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, we tested for association of genetic interactions with longitudinal MRI measurements of the inferior lateral ventricles (ILVs), which have repeatedly shown a relationship to LOAD status and progression. We performed linear regression to evaluate the ability of pathway-derived SNP-SNP pairs to predict the slope of change in volume of the ILVs. After Bonferroni correction, we identified four significant interactions in the right ILV (RILV) corresponding to gene-gene pairs SYNJ2-PI4KA, PARD3-MYH2, PDE3A-ABHD12B, and OR2L13-PRKG1 and one significant interaction in the left ILV (LILV) corresponding to SYNJ2-PI4KA. The SNP-SNP interaction corresponding to SYNJ2-PI4KA was identical in the RILV and LILV and was the most significant interaction in each (RILV: p = 9.13 Ã— 10(-12); LILV: p = 8.17 Ã— 10(-13)). Both genes belong to the inositol phosphate signaling pathway which has been previously associated with neurodegeneration in AD and we discuss the possibility that perturbation of this pathway results in a down-regulation of the Akt cell survival pathway and, thereby, decreased neuronal survival, as reflected by increased volume of the ventricles. 
24077434	A randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial of omega-3 fatty acids and alpha lipoic acid in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Oxidative stress, inflammation, and increased cholesterol levels are all mechanisms that have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Several epidemiologic studies have reported a decreased risk of AD with fish consumption. This pilot study was designed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids alone (Ï‰-3) or omega-3 plus alpha lipoic acid (Ï‰-3 + LA) compared to placebo on oxidative stress biomarkers in AD. The primary outcome measure was peripheral F2-isoprostane levels (oxidative stress measure). Secondary outcome measures included performance on: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL/IADL), and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Thirty-nine AD subjects were randomized to one of three groups: 1) placebo, 2) Ï‰-3, or 3) Ï‰-3 + LA for a treatment duration of 12 months. Eighty seven percent (34/39) of the subjects completed the 12-month intervention. There was no difference between groups at 12 months in peripheral F2-isoprostane levels (p = 0.83). The Ï‰-3 + LA and Ï‰-3 were not significantly different than the placebo group in ADAS-cog (p = 0.98, p = 0.86) and in ADL (p = 0.15, p = 0.82). Compared to placebo, the Ï‰-3 + LA showed less decline in MMSE (p &lt; 0.01) and IADL (p = 0.01) and the Ï‰-3 group showed less decline in IADL (p &lt; 0.01). The combination of Ï‰-3 + LA slowed cognitive and functional decline in AD over 12 months. Because the results were generated from a small sample size, further evaluation of the combination of omega-3 fatty acids plus alpha-lipoic acid as a potential treatment in AD is warranted.  
24077435	Detecting the effect of Alzheimer's disease on everyday motion behavior.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Early detection of behavioral changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) would help the design and implementation of specific interventions. The target of our investigation was to establish a correlation between diagnosis and unconstrained motion behavior in subjects without major clinical behavior impairments. We studied everyday motion behavior in 23 dyads with one partner suffering from AD dementia and one cognitively healthy partner in the subjects' home, employing ankle-mounted three-axes accelerometric sensors. We determined frequency features obtained from the signal envelopes computed by an envelope detector for the carrier band 0.5 Hz to 5 Hz. Based on these features, we employed quadratic discriminant analysis for building models discriminating between AD patients and healthy controls. After leave-one-out cross-validation, the classification accuracy of motion features reached 91% and was superior to the classification accuracy based on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Motion features were significantly correlated with MMSE and CMAI scores. Our findings suggest that changes of everyday behavior are detectable in accelerometric behavior protocols even in the absence of major clinical behavioral impairments in AD. 
24465216	A neurotoxic glycerophosphocholine impacts PtdIns-4, 5-bisphosphate and TORC2 signaling by altering ceramide biosynthesis in yeast.
PLoS Genet. 20140123 2014Jan
Unbiased lipidomic approaches have identified impairments in glycerophosphocholine second messenger metabolism in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we have shown that amyloid-Î²42 signals the intraneuronal accumulation of PC(O-16:0/2:0) which is associated with neurotoxicity. Similar to neuronal cells, intracellular accumulation of PC(O-16:0/2:0) is also toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, making yeast an excellent model to decipher the pathological effects of this lipid. We previously reported that phospholipase D, a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding protein, was relocalized in response to PC(O-16:0/2:0), suggesting that this neurotoxic lipid may remodel lipid signaling networks. Here we show that PC(O-16:0/2:0) regulates the distribution of the PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase Mss4 and its product PtdIns(4,5)P2 leading to the formation of invaginations at the plasma membrane (PM). We further demonstrate that the effects of PC(O-16:0/2:0) on the distribution of PM PtdIns(4,5)P2 pools are in part mediated by changes in the biosynthesis of long chain bases (LCBs) and ceramides. A combination of genetic, biochemical and cell imaging approaches revealed that PC(O-16:0/2:0) is also a potent inhibitor of signaling through the Target of rampamycin complex 2 (TORC2). Together, these data provide mechanistic insight into how specific disruptions in phosphocholine second messenger metabolism associated with Alzheimer's disease may trigger larger network-wide disruptions in ceramide and phosphoinositide second messenger biosynthesis and signaling which have been previously implicated in disease progression.  
22610992	Perinatal exposure to Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-Phthalate leads to cognitive dysfunction and phospho-tau level increase in aged rats.
Environ. Toxicol. 20120519 2014May
Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-Phthalate (DEHP) can affect glucose and insulin homeostasis in periphery and lead to insulin resistance, especially exposure of DEHP during critical developmental period. Given the potential relationship between insulin resistance and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly life, we investigated the relationship between perinatal DEHP exposure and AD pathogenesis. Our results suggested that perinatal exposure to DEHP can affect the expression of insulin and insulin-Akt- GSK-3Î² signal pathway in hippocampus. Furthermore, impaired cognitive ability and increased level of phospho-Tau was observed in DEHP-exposed rat offspring (1.25 Â± 0.11 vs. 0.47 Â± 0.07, P &lt; 0.05). The present study demonstrates that perinatal exposure to DEHP may be a potential risk factor for AD pathogenesis associated with insulin resistance and insulin metabolism disorder in the hippocampus. 
24590577	M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140303 2014Apr
The degeneration of cholinergic neurons and cholinergic hypofunction are pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) mediate acetylcholine-induced neurotransmission and five mAChR subtypes (M1-M5) have been identified. Among them, M1 mAChR is widely expressed in the central nervous system and has been implicated in many physiological and pathological brain functions. In addition, M1 mAChR is postulated to be an important therapeutic target for AD and several other neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, we review recent progress in understanding the functional involvement of M1 mAChR in AD pathology and in developing M1 mAChR agonists for AD treatment. 
24728269	Single App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Nat. Neurosci. 20140413 2014May
Experimental studies of Alzheimer's disease have largely depended on transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP). These mice, however, suffer from artificial phenotypes because, in addition to amyloid Î² peptide (AÎ²), they overproduce other APP fragments. We generated knock-in mice that harbor Swedish and Beyreuther/Iberian mutations with and without the Arctic mutation in the APP gene. The mice showed typical AÎ² pathology, neuroinflammation and memory impairment in an age-dependent manner.  
24594625	Neuronal and astrocytic metabolism in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 20140305 2014May
Regional hypometabolism of glucose in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about the specific alterations of neuronal and astrocytic metabolism involved in homeostasis of glutamate and GABA in AD. Here, we investigated the effects of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) pathology on neuronal and astrocytic metabolism and glial-neuronal interactions in amino acid neurotransmitter homeostasis in the transgenic McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat model of AD compared with healthy controls at age 15 months. Rats were injected with [1-(13)C]glucose and [1,2-(13)C]acetate, and extracts of the hippocampal formation as well as several cortical regions were analyzed using (1)H- and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography. Reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover was evident for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in hippocampal formation and frontal cortex, and for astrocytes in frontal cortex. Pyruvate carboxylation, which is necessary for de novo synthesis of amino acids, was decreased and affected the level of glutamine in hippocampal formation and those of glutamate, glutamine, GABA, and aspartate in the retrosplenial/cingulate cortex. Metabolic alterations were also detected in the entorhinal cortex. Overall, perturbations in energy- and neurotransmitter homeostasis, mitochondrial astrocytic and neuronal metabolism, and aspects of the glutamate-glutamine cycle were found in McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats.  
24796053	[Protective mechanism of acupuncture-moxibustion on hippocampal neuron mitochondria in rats with Alzheimer's disease].
Zhongguo Zhen Jiu  2014Feb
To observe effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on ultrastructure and silent information regulator 1 (SIR1) in hippocampal neuron mitochondria in rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in order to explore its possible effective mechanism during the process of protecting mitochondria. Eighty Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal group, a sham operation group, a model group and an acupuncture group, 20 rats in each one. The AD model was established in the model group and acupuncture group with injection of Amyloid beta Protein Fragment1-14 (Abeta1-42) into the hippocampus. Acupuncture and moxibustion was applied at "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Shenshu" (BL 23) in the acupuncture group, once a day, seven days as a treatment course and totally two course were required. The rest groups were all fed with normal diet, without any treatment. The transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting technique were respectively adapted to measure ultrastructure and level of STR1 in hippocampal neuron mitochondria in AD rats. Compared with the model group, the ultrastructure in hippocampal neuron mitochondria in the acupuncture group was effectively improved. The average optical density of SIR1 in hippocampus was 0.21 +/- 0.10 and the gray value was 136.82 +/- 47.42 in the model group, which were obviously lower than 0.47 +/- 0.09 and 281.44 +/- 57.98 in the normal group (both P &lt; 0.01). However, levels of SIR1 in the acupuncture group, they were 0.32 +/- 0.11 and 199.52 +/- 58.12, which were significantly increased compared with those in the model group (both P &lt; 0.05). The reinforcing-kidney and regulating-Governor Vessel method of acupuncture and moxibustion for AD could improve ultrastructure of mitochondria and increase levels of SIR1 to achieve the aim of recovering injury of mitochondria and protecting function of mitochondria. 
24585367	Mild to moderate Alzheimer dementia with insufficient neuropathological changes.
Ann. Neurol. 20140408 2014Apr
Recently, ~16% of participants in an anti-AÎ² passive immunotherapy trial for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) had a negative baseline amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Whether they have AD or are AD clinical phenocopies remains unknown. We examined the 2005-2013 National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center autopsy database and found that ~14% of autopsied subjects clinically diagnosed with mild-to-moderate probable AD have no or sparse neuritic plaques, which would expectedly yield a negative amyloid PET scan. More than half of these "AÎ²-negative" subjects have low neurofibrillary tangle Braak stages. These findings support the implementation of a positive amyloid biomarker as an inclusion criterion in future anti-AÎ² drug trials. 
24623259	Value of serum nonceruloplasmin copper for prediction of mild cognitive impairment conversion to Alzheimer disease.
Ann. Neurol. 20140414 2014Apr
Meta-analyses show that nonbound ceruloplasmin (non-Cp) copper (also known as free or labile copper) in serum is higher in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). It differentiates subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls. However, a longitudinal study on an MCI cohort has not yet been performed to assess the accuracy of non-Cp copper for the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD during a long-term follow-up. The study included 42 MCI converters and 99 stable MCI subjects. We assessed levels of copper, ceruloplasmin, non-Cp copper, iron, transferrin, ferritin, and APOE genotype. A multiple Cox regression analysis-with age, sex, baseline Mini-Mental State Examination, APOE4, iron, non-Cp copper, transferrin, ferritin, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension as covariates-was applied to predict the conversion from MCI to AD. Among the evaluated parameters, the only significant predictor of conversion to AD was non-Cp copper (hazard ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.47, p = 0.022); for each additional micromole per liter unit (Î¼mol/l) of non-Cp copper, the hazard increased by ~20%. Subjects with non-Cp copper levels &gt;1.6 Î¼mol/l had a hazard conversion rate (50% of conversion in 4 years) that was ~3Ã— higher than those with values â‰¤1.6 Î¼mol/l (&lt;20% in 4 years). The rate of conversion was similar between APOE4 carriers and noncarriers (p = 0.321), indicating that the non-Cp copper association was independent of APOE4. Non-Cp copper appears to predict conversion from MCI to AD. These results encourage healthy life style choices and dietary intervention to modify this risk. 
24706009	Tracking the earliest pathologic changes in Alzheimer disease.
Neurology 20140404 2014May6
A current challenge in Alzheimer disease (AD) research is to identify the sequence of pathologic changes that occurs during preclinical stages of disease in advance of cognitive decline. The timing of appearance of the 2 pathologic hallmarks of AD-amyloid deposition and tau-mediated neurodegeneration-is a particular topic of debate, with researchers drawing on a broad range of genetic, neuroimaging, fluid biomarker, animal, and autopsy studies to piece together the series of events ultimately leading to the plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive deficits that define AD.  
24706010	Rates of Î²-amyloid accumulation are independent of hippocampal neurodegeneration.
Neurology 20140404 2014May6
To test the hypotheses predicted in a hypothetical model of Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers that rates of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) accumulation on PET imaging are not related to hippocampal neurodegeneration whereas rates of neurodegenerative brain atrophy depend on the presence of both amyloid and neurodegeneration in a population-based sample. A total of 252 cognitively normal (CN) participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging had 2 or more serial visits with both amyloid PET and MRI. Subjects were classified into 4 groups based on baseline positive/negative amyloid PET (A+ or A-) and baseline hippocampal volume (N+ or N-). We compared rates of amyloid accumulation and rates of brain atrophy among the 4 groups. At baseline, 148 (59%) were amyloid negative and neurodegeneration negative (A-N-), 29 (12%) amyloid negative and neurodegeneration positive (A-N+), 56 (22%) amyloid positive and neurodegeneration negative (A+N-), and 19 (8%) amyloid positive and neurodegeneration positive (A+N+). High rates of AÎ² accumulation were found in those with abnormal amyloid at baseline and were not influenced by hippocampal neurodegeneration at baseline. In contrast, rates of brain atrophy were greatest in A+N+. We describe a 2-feature biomarker approach to classifying elderly CN subjects that is complementary to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association preclinical staging criteria. Our results support 2 key concepts in a model of the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers. First, the rate of AÎ² accumulation is not influenced by neurodegeneration and thus may be a biologically independent process. Second, AÎ² pathophysiology increases or catalyzes neurodegeneration. 
24706014	Insulin-like growth factor-1 and risk of Alzheimer dementia and brain atrophy.
Neurology 20140404 2014May6
To relate serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia and to brain volumes in a dementia-free community sample spanning middle and older ages. Dementia-free Framingham participants from generation 1 (n = 789, age 79 Â± 4 years, 64% women) and generation 2 (n = 2,793, age 61 Â± 9 years, 55% women; total = 3,582, age 65 Â± 11 years, 57% women) had serum IGF-1 measured in 1990-1994 and 1998-2001, respectively, and were followed prospectively for incident dementia and AD dementia. Brain MRI was obtained in stroke- and dementia-free survivors of both generations 1 (n = 186) and 2 (n = 1,867) during 1999-2005. Baseline IGF-1 was related to risk of incident dementia using Cox models and to total brain and hippocampal volumes using linear regression in multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, APOE Îµ4, plasma homocysteine, waist-hip ratio, and physical activity. Mean IGF-1 levels were 144 Â± 60 Î¼g/L in generation 1 and 114 Â± 37 Î¼g/L in generation 2. We observed 279 cases of incident dementia (230 AD dementia) over a mean follow-up of 7.4 Â± 3.1 years. Persons with IGF-1 in the lowest quartile had a 51% greater risk of AD dementia (hazard ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.00; p = 0.004). Among persons without dementia, higher IGF-1 levels were associated with greater total brain volumes (Î²/SD increment in IGF-1 was 0.55 Â± 0.24, p = 0.025; and 0.26 Â± 0.06, p &lt; 0.001, for generations 1 and 2, respectively). Lower serum levels of IGF-1 are associated with an increased risk of developing AD dementia and higher levels with greater brain volumes even among middle-aged community-dwelling participants free of stroke and dementia. Higher levels of IGF-1 may protect against subclinical and clinical neurodegeneration. 
24806669	A death receptor 6-amyloid precursor protein pathway regulates synapse density in the mature CNS but does not contribute to Alzheimer's disease-related pathophysiology in murine models.
J. Neurosci.  2014May7
Recent studies implicate death receptor 6 (DR6) in an amyloid precursor protein (APP)-dependent pathway regulating developmental axon pruning, and in a pruning pathway operating during plastic rearrangements in adult brain. DR6 has also been suggested to mediate toxicity in vitro of AÎ² peptides derived from APP. Given the link between APP, AÎ², and Alzheimer's disease (AD), these findings have raised the possibility that DR6 contributes to aspects of neurodegeneration in AD. To test this possibility, we have used mouse models to characterize potential function(s) of DR6 in the adult CNS and in AD-related pathophysiology. We show that DR6 is broadly expressed within the adult CNS and regulates the density of excitatory synaptic connections onto pyramidal neurons in a genetic pathway with APP. DR6 knock-out also gives rise to behavioral abnormalities, some of which are similar to those previously documented in APP knock-out animals. However, in two distinct APP transgenic models of AD, we did not observe any alteration in the formation of amyloid plaques, gliosis, synaptic loss, or cognitive behavioral deficits with genetic deletion of DR6, though we did observe a transient reduction in the degree of microglial activation in one model. Our results support the view that DR6 functions with APP to modulate synaptic density in the adult CNS, but do not provide evidence for a role of DR6 in the pathophysiology of AD.  
24806671	Astrocytic TDP-43 pathology in Alexander disease.
J. Neurosci.  2014May7
Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by the presence of eosinophilic inclusions known as Rosenthal fibers (RFs) within astrocytes, and is caused by dominant mutations in the coding region of the gene encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). GFAP is the major astrocytic intermediate filament, and in AxD patient brain tissue GFAP is a major component of RFs. TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is the major pathological protein in almost all cases of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and âˆ¼50% of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), designated as FTLD-TDP. In ALS and FTLD-TDP, TDP-43 becomes insoluble, ubiquitinated, and pathologically phosphorylated and accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions in both neurons and glia of affected brain and spinal cord regions. Previously, TDP-43 was detected in RFs of human pilocytic astrocytomas; however, involvement of TDP-43 in AxD has not been determined. Here we show that TDP-43 is present in RFs in AxD patient brains, and that insoluble phosphorylated full-length and high molecular weight TDP-43 accumulates in white matter of such brains. Phosphorylated TDP-43 also accumulates in the detergent-insoluble fraction from affected brain regions of Gfap(R236H/+) knock-in mice, which harbor a GFAP mutation homologous to one that causes AxD in humans, and TDP-43 colocalizes with astrocytic RF pathology in Gfap(R236H/+) mice and transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type GFAP. These findings suggest common pathogenic mechanisms in ALS, FTLD, and AxD, and this is the first report of TDP-43 involvement in a neurological disorder primarily affecting astrocytes.  
24806679	Combined effects of Alzheimer risk variants in the CLU and ApoE genes on ventricular expansion patterns in the elderly.
J. Neurosci.  2014May7
The C allele at the rs11136000 locus in the clusterin (CLU) gene is the third strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A recent genome-wide association study of LOAD found the strongest evidence of association with CLU at rs1532278, in high linkage disequilibrium with rs11136000. Brain structure and function are related to the CLU risk alleles, not just in LOAD patients but also in healthy young adults. We tracked the volume of the lateral ventricles across baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up scans in a large sample of elderly human participants (N = 736 at baseline), from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, to determine whether these CLU risk variants predicted longitudinal ventricular expansion. The rs11136000 major C allele-previously linked with reduced CLU expression and with increased risk for dementia-predicted faster expansion, independently of dementia status or ApoE genotype. Further analyses revealed that the CLU and ApoE risk variants had combined effects on both volumetric expansion and lateral ventricle surface morphology. The rs1532278 locus strongly resembles a regulatory element. Its association with ventricular expansion was slightly stronger than that of rs11136000 in our analyses, suggesting that it may be closer to a functional variant. Clusterin affects inflammation, immune responses, and amyloid clearance, which in turn may result in neurodegeneration. Pharmaceutical agents such as valproate, which counteract the effects of genetically determined reduced clusterin expression, may help to achieve neuroprotection and contribute to the prevention of dementia, especially in carriers of these CLU risk variants.  
24824692	Effects of anti-Alzheimer drugs on phosphorylation and assembly of microtubules from brain microtubular proteins.
Bull. Exp. Biol. Med. 20140503 2014Apr
We studied the effects of anti-Alzheimer drugs (tacrine, amiridine, and memantine) on phosphorylation of tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins isolated from rat brain, evaluated the capacity of these proteins to polymerize into microtubules after addition of study pharmacological agents, and analyzed the structure of generated microtubules. It was shown that test substances impair assembly of microtubules to a different extent. Dose-dependent effects of these agents on phosphorylation of tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins were observed. Triazolam (not approved for clinical use as anti-Alzheimer drug) in the same concentrations was used as the reference substance in the same tests. It was observed that this substance even in minimal concentration induced the most pronounced changes in microtubule structure. A direct correlation between the capacity of the test substances to modulate tubulin phosphorylation and to impair microtubule structure was found: the more the substance inhibited tubulin phosphorylation, the more it disordered microtubule structure.  
24252395	Meta-analysis of the endogenous N200 latency event-related potential subcomponent in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
Clin Neurophysiol 20131101 2014Jun
The N200 latency subcomponent has the potential to be an accurate neurophysiological marker of the cognitive deterioration seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Standard mean difference (SMD) estimates of the N200 latency subcomponent were compared in three treatment groups: patients with AD, patients with MCI, and an unrelated elderly control group. Patients with AD had significantly prolonged N200 latencies compared to the control group, pooled SMD: 0.866 (95% CI: 0.517 to 1.214, z=4.87, p&lt;0.001). Patients with MCI had significantly prolonged N200 latencies compared to the control group, pooled SMD: 0.578 (95% CI: 0.213 to 0.943, z=3.31, p=0.002). When comparing patients with AD and MCI the N200 latencies were similar, pooled SMD: 0.096 (95% CI: -0.261 to 0.453, z=0.53, p=0.598). The abnormalities present in the N200 latency subcomponent validate previous research that N200 latency is an informative indicator of information-processing deterioration in patients with cognitive impairment. Clinically, measurements of N200 latency can be used as a risk assessment of elderly patients that may be progressing to mild cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer's disease. 
24464653	Distinct patterns of sirtuin expression during progression of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuromolecular Med. 20140125 2014Jun
Aging is one of the major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sirtuins are associated with prolonged life span. To examine whether the expression levels of sirtuins associate with the progression of AD or not, we performed a comparative immunoblotting and immunohistochemical study of SIRT1, 3, and 5 in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal subregions and white matter in 45 cases grouped according to Braak and Braak stages of neurofibrillary degeneration. In addition, we compared the expression levels with the local load of tau and amyloid-beta deposits, evaluated using morphometry. Our study revealed that (1) the neuronal subcellular redistribution of SIRT1 parallels the decrease in its expression, suggesting stepwise loss of neuroprotection dependent on the neuronal population; (2) in contrast to SIRT1 and 3, expression of SIRT5 increases during the progression of AD; (3) which might be related to its appearance in activated microglial cells. The complex patterns of the expression of sirtuins in relation to tissue damage should be taken into account when searching for therapies interacting with sirtuins.  
24497179	The SIRT2 polymorphism rs10410544 and risk of Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.
Neuromolecular Med. 20140205 2014Jun
Previous studies have reported an association between human sirtuins' single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4-negative population, although the findings are inconsistent. To obtain a more precise estimation of this relationship, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between the rs10410544 C/T polymorphism of SIRT2 and the risk of AD with APOE Îµ4 status. We searched all relevant PubMed publications and included three studies in our meta-analysis involving a total of 1,794 patients and 2,054 control subjects. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed to evaluate the association of the SIRT2 SNP with AD susceptibility, and we analyzed the extracted data stratified by the APOE Îµ4-carrying status. Overall, the results show that the SIRT2 SNP is associated with human AD risk in the comparison models (T vs. C: OR 1.140, 95% CI 1.034-1.258; TC vs. CC: OR 1.178, 95% CI 1.019-1.361; TT + TC vs. CC: OR 1.197, 95% CI 1.043-1.373). In the stratified analyses, the European population had a significantly increased risk of AD (T vs. C: OR 1.110, 95% CI 1.002-1.229), and we also observed a significant association in the APOE Îµ4-negative population (T vs. C: OR 1.165, 95% CI 1.025-1.324; TT + TC vs. CC: OR 1.222, 95% CI 1.022-1.461). This meta-analysis indicates that the presence of the SIRT2 SNP with APOE Îµ4-negative status contributes to the development of AD in humans Epidemiological studies of larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm this hypothesis. 
24926196	Disease progression model for Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat 20140524 2014
The objective of this analysis was to develop a nonlinear disease progression model, using an expanded set of covariates that captures the longitudinal Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. These were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI-1 study, of 301 Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment patients who were followed for 2-3 years. The model describes progression rate and baseline disease score as a function of covariates. The covariates that were tested fell into five groups: a) hippocampal volume; b) serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers; c) demographics and apolipoprotein Epsilon 4 (ApoE4) allele status; d) baseline cognitive tests; and e) disease state and comedications. Covariates associated with baseline disease severity were disease state, hippocampal volume, and comedication use. Disease progression rate was influenced by baseline CSF biomarkers, Trail-Making Test part A score, delayed logical memory test score, and current level of impairment as measured by CDR-SB. The rate of disease progression was dependent on disease severity, with intermediate scores around the inflection point score of 10 exhibiting high disease progression rate. The CDR-SB disease progression rate in a typical patient, with late mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease, was estimated to be approximately 0.5 and 1.4 points/year, respectively. In conclusion, this model describes disease progression in terms of CDR-SB changes in patients and its dependency on novel covariates. The CSF biomarkers included in the model discriminate mild cognitive impairment subjects as progressors and nonprogressors. Therefore, the model may be utilized for optimizing study designs, through patient population enrichment and clinical trial simulations. 
24936619	Low-dose total-body carbon-ion irradiations induce early transcriptional alteration without late Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice.
J. Neurosci. Res.  2014Jul
The cause and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown. Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1Î±), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1Î±) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-Î² peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-Î² protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate that low doses of carbon-ion irradiations did not cause behavioral impairment or AD-like pathological change in mice. 
24741770	A review on the cause-effect relationship between oxidative stress and toxic proteins in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi  2014 Jan-Mar
Protein aggregates are the defining pathological feature of human neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have revealed that mutant huntingtin, polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 can cause elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in neuronal cells. It has also been indicated that the normal host prion protein behaves as an antioxidant, while the neurotoxic peptide based on the sequence of the scrapie isoform increases hydrogen peroxide toxicity in neuronal cultures. Additionally, not only can oxidative stress contribute to the aggregation of beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein, but both beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein can induce oxidative damage. Furthermore, oxidative stressors have been shown to play a critical role in neurofibrillary pathology leading to tau hyperphosphorylation. In conclusion, the present review supports a cause-effect relationship between oxidative stress and toxic proteins in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. 
24094038	The branched-chain aminotransferase proteins: novel redox chaperones for protein disulfide isomerase-implications in Alzheimer's disease.
Antioxid. Redox Signal. 20131221 2014Jun1
The human branched-chain aminotransferase proteins (hBCATm and hBCATc) are regulated through oxidation and S-nitrosation. However, it remains unknown whether they share common redox characteristics to enzymes such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in terms of regulating cellular repair and protein misfolding. Here, similar to PDI, the hBCAT proteins showed dithiol-disulfide isomerase activity that was mediated through an S-glutathionylated mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis of the active thiols of the CXXC motif demonstrates that they are fundamental to optimal protein folding. Far Western analysis indicated that both hBCAT proteins can associate with PDI. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that hBCATm directly binds to PDI in IMR-32 cells and the human brain. Electron and confocal microscopy validated the expression of PDI in mitochondria (using Mia40 as a mitochondrial control), where both PDI and Mia40 were found to be co-localized with hBCATm. Under conditions of oxidative stress, this interaction is decreased, suggesting that the proposed chaperone role for hBCATm may be perturbed. Moreover, immunohistochemistry studies show that PDI and hBCAT are expressed in the same neuronal and endothelial cells of the vasculature of the human brain, supporting a physiological role for this binding. This study identifies a novel redox role for hBCAT and confirms that hBCATm differentially binds to PDI under cellular stress. These studies indicate that hBCAT may play a role in the stress response of the cell as a novel redox chaperone, which, if compromised, may result in protein misfolding, creating aggregates as a key feature in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. 
24413542	An intergenerational choir formed to lessen Alzheimer's disease stigma in college students and decrease the social isolation of people with Alzheimer's disease and their family members: a pilot study.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20140110 2014May
The intergenerational choir was formed for the purpose of combating the stigma of Alzheimer's disease in college students, and in that process also lessening the social isolation of people with AD and their family members. The choir was composed of 13 college students and 13 people with AD and a family member. Data from the college students were gathered through semi-structured open-ended questions on attitudes and knowledge about AD, collected at three points in time over 8 weeks of rehearsals. Data were collected from the people with AD and their family members through a focus group and observations over 8 weeks of rehearsals. Results a show a decrease in social isolation for the older choir members, and for the college students: a decrease in negative attitudes, an increase in positive attitudes and themes of - recognizing capabilities, expanded understanding of AD, reduced stigma, and reduced social discomfort. 
24421409	Open-label, short-term, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with Alzheimer's disease with functional imaging correlates and literature review.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20140113 2014May
Accumulating evidence suggests repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be beneficial in ameliorating cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD patients received four high-frequency rTMS sessions over the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) over two weeks. Structured cognitive assessments were administered at baseline, at 2 weeks after completion of rTMS, and at 4 weeks post treatment. At these same times, tolerant patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing structured motor and cognitive tasks. We also reviewed literature regarding the effects of rTMS on cognitive function in AD. A total of 12 patients were enrolled, eight of whom tolerated the fMRI. Improvement was seen in Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination tests of verbal and non-verbal agility 4 weeks post-treatment. The fMRI analysis showed trends for increased activation during cognitive performance tasks immediately after and at 4 weeks post-treatment. Our literature review revealed several double-blind, sham-controlled studies, all showing sustained improvement in cognition of AD patients with rTMS. There was improvement in aspects of language after four rTMS treatments, sustained a month after treatment cessation. Our results are consistent with other studies and standardization of treatment protocols using functional imaging may be of benefit. 
24746486	Cognitive and emotional profiles of aged Alzheimer's disease (3Ã—TgAD) mice: effects of environmental enrichment and sexual dimorphism.
Behav. Brain Res. 20140415 2014Jul15
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with age which represents the most common cause of dementia. It is characterized by an accelerated memory loss compared to normal aging, and deterioration of other cognitive abilities that interfere with mood, reason, judgment and language. The main neuropathological hallmarks of the disorder are Î²-amyloid (Î²A) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau tangles. Triple transgenic 3Ã—TgAD mouse model develops Î²A and Tau pathologies in a progressive manner, with a specific temporal and anatomic profile mimicking the pattern that takes place in the human brain with AD, and showing cognitive alterations characteristic of the disease. Environmental enrichment treatment in mice induces behavioral and emotional reactivity changes, including cognitive improvements in some AD-related transgenic mice. The present work intended to characterize the behavioral profile of 3Ã—TgAD mice at advanced stages of neuropathological development (12 and 15 months of age) and to investigate whether environmental enrichment administered during adulthood was able to modify some of their behavioral and cognitive alterations. Results show that, at advanced stages of the disease 3Ã—TgAD mice show deficits of spatial learning acquisition, as well as short-term and working memory deficits, while displaying increased levels of anxiety/fearfulness and normal sensorimotor functions. 3Ã—TgAD mice also show sexual dimorphism, as reflected by increased cognitive deficits in females and increased levels of novelty-induced behavioral inhibition in males. Environmental enrichment exerts some slight positive effects, by mainly improving the initial acquisition of the spatial learning and working memory in 12-month-old 3Ã—TgAD mice. Such effects vary depending on the gender.  
24627227	Novel mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene within Moroccan patients with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Mol. Neurosci. 20140314 2014Jun
In Morocco, Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects almost 30,000 individuals, and this number could increase to 75,000 by 2020. To our knowledge, the genes predisposing individuals to AD and predicting disease incidence remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the genetic contribution of mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene exons 16 and 17 to familial and sporadic AD cases. Seventeen sporadic cases and eight family cases were seen at the memory clinic of the University of Casablanca Neurology Department. These patients underwent standard somatic neurological examination, cognitive function assessment, brain imaging, and laboratory tests. Direct sequencing of exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene was performed on genomic DNA of AD patients. In this original Moroccan study, we identified seven novel frameshift mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene. Interestingly, only one novel splice mutation was detected in a family case. There is a strong correlation between clinical symptoms and genetic factors in Moroccan patients with a family history of AD. Therefore, mutations in APP gene exons 16 and 17 may eventually become genetic markers for AD predisposition.  
24704512	Novel presenilin mutations within Moroccan patients with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.
Neuroscience 20140404 2014Jun6
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that causes gradual and irreversible loss of higher brain functions and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, as assessed by autopsy and clinical series. Furthermore, it has an annual incidence of approximately 3% in the 65-74-year-old age group. This incidence rate doubles with every increment of 5 years above the age of 65. In Morocco, AD affects almost 30,000 individuals and this number will possibly increase to 75,000 by 2020 (projections of the World Health Organization (WHO)). Genetically, AD is caused by a mutation in one of at least 3 genes: presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Most cases are late onset and apparently sporadic, most likely as a result of a combination of environmental and non-dominant genetic factors. In Morocco, the genes predisposing individuals to AD and predicting disease incidence remain elusive. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the genetic contribution of mutations in PS1 and PS2 genes to familial early-onset AD cases and sporadic late-onset AD cases. Seventeen sporadic late-onset AD cases and eight familial early-onset AD cases were seen at the memory clinic of the University of Casablanca Neurology Department. These patients underwent standard somatic neurological examination, cognitive function assessment, brain imaging and laboratory tests. Direct sequencing of each exon in PS1 and PS2 genes was performed on genomic DNA of AD patients. Further, we identified 1 novel frameshift mutation in the PS1 gene and 2 novel frameshift mutations in the PS2 gene. Our mutational analysis reports a correlation between clinical symptoms and genetic factors in our cases of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD). These putative mutations cosegregate with affected family members suggesting a direct mutagenic effect. 
24853428	Altered expression of Alzheimer's disease-related genes in the cerebellum of autistic patients: a model for disrupted brain connectome and therapy.
Cell Death Dis 20140522 2014
Autism and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are, respectively, neurodevelopmental and degenerative diseases with an increasing epidemiological burden. The AD-associated amyloid-Î² precursor protein-Î± has been shown to be elevated in severe autism, leading to the 'anabolic hypothesis' of its etiology. Here we performed a focused microarray analysis of genes belonging to NOTCH and WNT signaling cascades, as well as genes related to AD and apoptosis pathways in cerebellar samples from autistic individuals, to provide further evidence for pathological relevance of these cascades for autism. By using the limma package from R and false discovery rate, we demonstrated that 31% (116 out of 374) of the genes belonging to these pathways displayed significant changes in expression (corrected P-values &lt;0.05), with mitochondria-related genes being the most downregulated. We also found upregulation of GRIN1, the channel-forming subunit of NMDA glutamate receptors, and MAP3K1, known activator of the JNK and ERK pathways with anti-apoptotic effect. Expression of PSEN2 (presinilin 2) and APBB1 (or F65) were significantly lower when compared with control samples. Based on these results, we propose a model of NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated ERK activation of Î±-secretase activity and mitochondrial adaptation to apoptosis that may explain the early brain overgrowth and disruption of synaptic plasticity and connectome in autism. Finally, systems pharmacology analyses of the model that integrates all these genes together (NOWADA) highlighted magnesium (Mg(2+)) and rapamycin as most efficient drugs to target this network model in silico. Their potential therapeutic application, in the context of autism, is therefore discussed.  
24329875	Cholesterol as a causative factor in Alzheimer's disease: a debatable hypothesis.
J. Neurochem. 20140102 2014May
High serum/plasma cholesterol levels have been suggested as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some reports, mostly retrospective epidemiological studies, have observed a decreased prevalence of AD in patients taking the cholesterol lowering drugs, statins. The strongest evidence causally linking cholesterol to AD is provided by experimental studies showing that adding/reducing cholesterol alters amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta-protein (Ab) levels. However, there are problems with the cholesterol-AD hypothesis. Cholesterol levels in serum/plasma and brain of AD patients do not support cholesterol as a causative factor in AD.Prospective studies on statins and AD have largely failed to show efficacy. Even the experimental data are open to interpretation given that it is well-established that modification of cholesterol levels has effects on multiple proteins, not only amyloid precursor protein and Ab. The purpose of this review, therefore, was to examine the above-mentioned issues, discuss the pros and cons of the cholesterol-AD hypothesis, involvement of other lipids in the mevalonate pathway, and consider that AD may impact cholesterol homeostasis. 
24711225	Dual roles for autophagy: degradation and secretion of Alzheimer's disease AÎ² peptide.
Bioessays 20140408 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease exhibiting amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide accumulation as a key characteristic. Autophagy, which is dysregulated in AD, participates in the metabolism of AÎ². Unexpectedly, we recently found that autophagy, in addition to its degradative function, also mediates the secretion of AÎ². This finding adds AÎ² to an increasing number of biomolecules, the secretion of which is mediated by autophagy. We also showed that inhibition of AÎ² secretion through genetic deletion of autophagy leads to intracellular AÎ² accumulation, which enhanced neurodegeneration induced by autophagy deficiency. Hence, autophagy may play a central role in two pathological hallmarks of AD: AÎ² amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. Herein, we summarize the role of autophagy in AD with focus on AÎ² metabolism in light of the recently established role of autophagy in protein secretion. We discuss potential routes for autophagy-mediated AÎ² secretion and suggest experimental approaches to further elucidate its mechanisms.  
24668390	Homeostasis of metals in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
Biometals 20140326 2014Jun
In order to study the involvement of metals in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, serum samples from patients with Alzheimer and mild cognitive impairment were investigated. For this purpose, metal content was analyzed after size-fractionation of species and then, inter-element and inter-fraction ratios were computed. In this way, the analysis allowed discovering changes that could be used as markers of disease, but also provided a new insight into the interactions in the homeostasis of elements in neurodegeneration and its progression. Aluminum and labile forms of iron and copper were increased in demented patients, while manganese, zinc and selenium were reduced. Interestingly, levels of different elements, principally iron, aluminum and manganese, were closely inter-related, which could evidence a complex interdependency between the homeostasis of the different metals in this disorder. On the other hand, imbalances in metabolism of copper, zinc and selenium could be associated to abnormal redox status. Therefore, this study may contribute to our understanding of the pathological mechanisms related to metals in Alzheimer's disease.  
23314940	Impaired long distance functional connectivity and weighted network architecture in Alzheimer's disease.
Cereb. Cortex 20130111 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a disconnection syndrome, which leads to cognitive impairment due to the disruption of functional activity across large networks or systems of interconnected brain regions. We explored abnormal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting-state dynamics, functional connectivity, and weighted functional networks, in a sample of patients with severe AD (N = 18) and age-matched healthy volunteers (N = 21). We found that patients had reduced amplitude and regional homogeneity of low-frequency fMRI oscillations, and reduced the strength of functional connectivity, in several regions previously described as components of the default mode network, for example, medial posterior parietal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. In patients with severe AD, functional connectivity was particularly attenuated between regions that were separated by a greater physical distance; and loss of long distance connectivity was associated with less efficient global and nodal network topology. This profile of functional abnormality in severe AD was consistent with the results of a comparable analysis of data on 2 additional groups of patients with mild AD (N = 17) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 18). A greater degree of cognitive impairment, measured by the mini-mental state examination across all patient groups, was correlated with greater attenuation of functional connectivity, particularly over long connection distances, for example, between anterior and posterior components of the default mode network, and greater reduction of global and nodal network efficiency. These results indicate that neurodegenerative disruption of fMRI oscillations and connectivity in AD affects long-distance connections to hub nodes, with the consequent loss of network efficiency. This profile was evident also to a lesser degree in the patients with less severe cognitive impairment, indicating that the potential of resting-state fMRI measures as biomarkers or predictors of disease progression in AD.  
24508835	Building a pipeline to discover and validate novel therapeutic targets and lead compounds for Alzheimer's disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140206 2014Apr15
Cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes are major public health problems worldwide. With changing demographics, the number of persons with dementia will increase rapidly. The treatment and prevention of AD and other dementias, therefore, is an urgent unmet need. There have been considerable advances in understanding the biology of many age-related disorders that cause dementia. Gains in understanding AD have led to the development of ante-mortem biomarkers of traditional neuropathology and the conduct of several phase III interventions in the amyloid-Î² cascade early in the disease process. Many other intervention strategies are in various stages of development. However, efforts to date have met with limited success. A recent National Institute on Aging Research Summit led to a number of requests for applications. One was to establish multi-disciplinary teams of investigators who use systems biology approaches and stem cell technology to identify a new generation of AD targets. We were recently awarded one of three such grants to build a pipeline that integrates epidemiology, systems biology, and stem cell technology to discover and validate novel therapeutic targets and lead compounds for AD treatment and prevention. Here we describe the two cohorts that provide the data and biospecimens being exploited for our pipeline and describe the available unique datasets. Second, we present evidence in support of a chronic disease model of AD that informs our choice of phenotypes as the target outcome. Third, we provide an overview of our approach. Finally, we present the details of our planned drug discovery pipeline.  
24621497	Involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î²/Î´ (PPAR Î²/Î´) in BDNF signaling during aging and in Alzheimer disease: possible role of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE).
Cell Cycle 20140304 2014Apr15
Aging and many neurological disorders, such as AD, are linked to oxidative stress, which is considered the common effector of the cascade of degenerative events. In this phenomenon, reactive oxygen species play a fundamental role in the oxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids, resulting in the formation of a complex mixture of aldehydic end products, such as malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, and other alkenals. Interestingly, 4-HNE has been indicated as an intracellular agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î²/Î´. In this study, we examined, at early and advanced AD stages (3, 9, and 18 months), the pattern of 4-HNE and its catabolic enzyme glutathione S-transferase P1 in relation to the expression of PPARÎ²/Î´, BDNF signaling, as mRNA and protein, as well as on their pathological forms (i.e., precursors or truncated forms). The data obtained indicate a novel detrimental age-dependent role of PPAR Î²/Î´ in AD by increasing pro-BDNF and decreasing BDNF/TrkB survival pathways, thus pointing toward the possibility that a specific PPARÎ²/Î´ antagonist may be used to counteract the disease progression.  
24085630	Chemical constituents and their acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory and antioxidant activities from leaves of Acanthopanax henryi: potential complementary source against Alzheimer's disease.
Arch. Pharm. Res. 20131002 2014May
The aim of this study was to investigate chemical constituents of the leaves of Acanthopanax henryi, and their antioxidant, acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Caffeoyl quinic acid derivates and flavonoids were obtained from A. henry, through column chromatography technologies, and the content of major constituents was determined by the HPLC-UV method. Anti-oxidant activity of the isolated metabolites was evaluated by free radical scavenging (DPPH, ABTS radicals) and superoxide anion scavenging. The results showed that di-caffeoyl quinic acid derivates had stronger antioxidant activity than positive controls (ascorbic acid, trolox and allopurinol). Acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity was estimated on the constituents, among which, quercetin, 4-caffeoyl-quinic acid and 4,5-caffeoyl quinic acid were found to have strong acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 62.6 to 121.9 Î¼M. The present study showed that some of the tested constituents from the leaves of A. henryi exhibit strong antioxidant and acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory effects. This suggest that the leaves of A. henryi can be used as a new natural complementary source of acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors and anti-oxidant agents, thus being a promising potential complementary source against Alzheimer's disease. 
24636273	Calcium dysregulation, and lithium treatment to forestall Alzheimer's disease - a merging of hypotheses.
Cell Calcium 20140222 2014Mar
Intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations are tightly regulated, and elevated levels sustained over periods of time can cause cellular deterioration. The putative role of dysregulated intracellular Ca(2+) in Alzheimer's disease had led to the hypothesis that controlling intracellular Ca(2+) may forestall cognitive decline. Lithium has been shown to reduce intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. Two well-characterized neuronal targets of lithium that may affect intracellular Ca(2+) levels are N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and inositol monophosphatase (IMP). Results from a recent single-center placebo-controlled randomized trial suggest that long-term lithium treatment at subtherapeutic doses may have the potential to delay the progression of disease, and observational studies have shown that lithium reduces the prevalence of dementia in subjects with bipolar disorder on long-term lithium therapy. I am advancing the hypothesis that lithium may protect against cognitive decline by stabilizing intracellular Ca(2+) through a dual, synergistic mechanism of targeting both extracellular and intracellular sites, via antagonizing NMDA-receptors and inhibiting IMP. Insights derived from this hypothesis could lead to an improved understanding of the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and have implications on the evaluation and use of therapeutics that alter intracellular Ca(2+) levels.  
24728621	Levels and correlates of knowledge about Alzheimer's disease among older Chinese Americans.
J Cross Cult Gerontol  2014Jun
This study examined knowledge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates of AD knowledge in a sample of Chinese American older adults living in the Phoenix metropolitan area of the United States. Survey data were collected from 385 Chinese Americans age 55 or older (Mâ€‰=â€‰72.43, SDâ€‰=â€‰8.67) recruited from various settings not limited to senior housing facilities, senior clubs, senior centers and church groups. Participants responded to a 24-item true/false AD knowledge scale with 73 % accuracy. Multivariate regression analyses found that participants who held more traditional Chinese cultural beliefs of AD tended to have less AD knowledge. Older women had more knowledge of AD than men when educational differences were controlled. Participants who used media to acquire AD information had more AD knowledge than those did not. AD educational programs should target domains (e.g., risk factors, symptoms, and caregiving) about which Chinese American elders tend to have less knowledge; AD information should be disseminated through appropriate media to outreach Chinese American elders more effectively. Addressing the biases in elders' cultural beliefs of AD should be incorporated in AD educational programs. 
24530168	Exploring experiences of physical activity among people with Alzheimer's disease and their spouse carers: a qualitative study.
Physiotherapy 20131208 2014Jun
To improve understanding about the barriers and facilitators to physical activity for people with Alzheimer's disease and their spouse carers, and to consider the development of activity interventions that would be acceptable, sustainable and feasible for both groups. A qualitative approach, using semi-structured interviews, facilitated exploration of physical activity in a small group of people with Alzheimer's disease and their spouse carers. Participants were recruited from one memory clinic in South West England. Potential participants were identified by clinical psychologists at the memory clinic and were given information about participating in the research. Five people with Alzheimer's disease and their spouse carers were subsequently recruited for semi-structured interviews, which took place at the memory clinic. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Three major themes have been presented. The findings illustrate the complex interplay between the overarching themes 'self', 'others' and 'couple' that affect physical activity for both people with Alzheimer's disease and their spouse carers, and which are linked to the progression of dementia. An individually tailored approach for couples, which values the role of the carer and accounts for the progressive and changing nature of dementia, should be a guiding principle for intervention design. 
24918054	Changed membrane integration and catalytic site conformation are two mechanisms behind the increased AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio by presenilin 1 familial Alzheimer-linked mutations.
FEBS Open Bio 20140424 2014
The enzyme complex Î³-secretase generates amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²), a 37-43-residue peptide associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytical subunit of Î³-secretase, result in familial AD (FAD). A unifying theme among FAD mutations is an alteration in the ratio AÎ² species produced (the AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio), but the molecular mechanisms responsible remain elusive. In this report we have studied the impact of several different PS1 FAD mutations on the integration of selected PS1 transmembrane domains and on PS1 active site conformation, and whether any effects translate to a particular amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing phenotype. Most mutations studied caused an increase in the AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio, but via different mechanisms. The mutations that caused a particular large increase in the AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio did also display an impaired APP intracellular domain (AICD) formation and a lower total AÎ² production. Interestingly, seven mutations close to the catalytic site caused a severely impaired integration of proximal transmembrane/hydrophobic sequences into the membrane. This structural defect did not correlate to a particular APP processing phenotype. Six selected FAD mutations, all of which exhibited different APP processing profiles and impact on PS1 transmembrane domain integration, were found to display an altered active site conformation. Combined, our data suggest that FAD mutations affect the PS1 structure and active site differently, resulting in several complex APP processing phenotypes, where the most aggressive mutations in terms of increased AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio are associated with a decrease in total Î³-secretase activity.  
24309505	Concise and high-yield synthesis of T808 and T808P for radiosynthesis of [(18)F]-T808, a PET tau tracer for Alzheimer's disease.
Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 20131120 2014Jan1
The authentic standard T808 and its corresponding mesylate precursor T808P were synthesized in six steps using ethyl vinyl ether and trichlorocetyl chloride as starting materials. The overall chemical yields of T808 and T808P were 35% and 52%, respectively. [(18)F]-T808 was synthesized from T808P by the nucleophilic substitution with K[(18)F]F/Kryptofix 2.2.2 and isolated by HPLC combined with solid-phase extraction (SPE) purification in 35-45% radiochemical yield with 37-370GBq/Î¼mol specific activity at end of bombardment (EOB).  
24342238	Design, synthesis and anti-Alzheimer properties of dimethylaminomethyl-substituted curcumin derivatives.
Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 20131208 2014Jan1
Eight dimethylaminomethyl-substituted curcumin derivatives were designed and synthesized. The antioxidant test revealed that the synthesized compounds had higher free radical scavenging activity towards both 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radicals (DPPH) (IC50 1.5-29.9Î¼M) and galvinoxyl radicals (IC50 4.9-41.1Î¼M) than the lead compound curcumin. Besides, compound 3a could effectively inhibit the AÎ² self-aggregation in vitro. Investigated in phosphate-buffered solutions (pH=7.4) in the presence or absence of 0.1% FBS 3a showed a good stability while curcumin did not. Furthermore, 3a showed a good lipophilicity (logP=3.48), suggesting a potential ability to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier. The aqueous solubility of the hydrochloride salt of 3a (16.7mg/mL) has also been significantly improved as compared with curcumin (&lt;0.1mg/mL).  
24336141	Age at surgical menopause influences cognitive decline and Alzheimer pathology in older women.
Neurology 20131211 2014Jan21
To determine the association between age at surgical menopause and both cognitive decline and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology in 2 longitudinal cohorts. Female subjects from 2 longitudinal studies of cognitive decline (Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project) were included (total n = 1,884). The primary analysis examined the association between age at surgical menopause and decline in a global cognition score. Secondary analyses examined additional outcomes: 1) decline in 5 cognitive subdomains and 2) a global measure of the burden of AD pathology. In exploratory analyses, we examined the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). We adjusted all models for age, education, smoking, and cohort and stratified by surgical vs natural menopause. For the 32% of subjects with surgical menopause, earlier age at menopause was associated with faster decline in global cognition (p = 0.0007), specifically episodic memory (p = 0.0003) and semantic memory (p = 0.002). Earlier age at menopause was also associated with increased AD neuropathology (p = 0.038), in particular neuritic plaques (p = 0.013). HRT use for at least 10 years, when administered within a 5-year perimenopausal window, was associated with decreased decline in global cognition. No associations were seen in women who had natural menopause. Early age at surgical menopause was associated with cognitive decline and AD neuropathology. Ongoing studies should clarify the potential effect of HRT on this relationship. 
24067533	Functional screening in Drosophila identifies Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes and implicates Tau-mediated mechanisms.
Hum. Mol. Genet. 20130925 2014Feb15
Using a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we systematically evaluated 67 candidate genes based on AD-associated genomic loci (P &lt; 10(-4)) from published human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genetic manipulation of 87 homologous fly genes was tested for modulation of neurotoxicity caused by human Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD. RNA interference (RNAi) targeting 9 genes enhanced Tau neurotoxicity, and in most cases reciprocal activation of gene expression suppressed Tau toxicity. Our screen implicates cindr, the fly ortholog of the human CD2AP AD susceptibility gene, as a modulator of Tau-mediated disease mechanisms. Importantly, we also identify the fly orthologs of FERMT2 and CELF1 as Tau modifiers, and these loci have been independently validated as AD susceptibility loci in the latest GWAS meta-analysis. Both CD2AP and FERMT2 have been previously implicated with roles in cell adhesion, and our screen additionally identifies a fly homolog of the human integrin adhesion receptors, ITGAM and ITGA9, as a modifier of Tau neurotoxicity. Our results highlight cell adhesion pathways as important in Tau toxicity and AD susceptibility and demonstrate the power of model organism genetic screens for the functional follow-up of human GWAS.  
24722782	CB2 receptor deficiency increases amyloid pathology and alters tau processing in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Med. 20140314 2014
The endocannabinoid CB2 receptor system has been implicated in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to investigate the impact of the CB2 receptor system on AD pathology, a colony of mice with a deleted CB2 receptor gene, CNR2, was established on a transgenic human mutant APP background for pathological comparison with CB2 receptor-sufficient transgenic mice. J20 APP (PDGFB-APPSwInd) mice were bred over two generations with CNR2(-/-) (Cnr2(tm1Dgen)/J) mice to produce a colony of J20 CNR2(+/+) and J20 CNR2(-/-) mice. Seventeen J20 CNR2(+/+) mice (12 females, 5 males) and 16 J20 CNR2(-/-) mice (11 females, 5 males) were killed at 12 months, and their brains were interrogated for AD-related pathology with both biochemistry and immunocytochemistry (ICC). In addition to amyloid-dependent endpoints such as soluble AÎ² production and plaque deposition quantified with 6E10 staining, the effect of CB2 receptor deletion on total soluble mouse tau production was assayed by using a recently developed high-sensitivity assay. Results revealed that soluble AÎ²42 and plaque deposition were significantly increased in J20 CNR2(-/-) mice relative to CNR2(+/+) mice. Microgliosis, quantified with ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) staining, did not differ between groups, whereas plaque associated microglia was more abundant in J20 CNR2(-/-) mice. Total tau was significantly suppressed in J20 CNR2(-/-) mice relative to J20 CNR2(+/+) mice. The results confirm the constitutive role of the CB2 receptor system both in reducing amyloid plaque pathology in AD and also support tehpotential of cannabinoid therapies targeting CB2 to reduce AÎ²; however, the results suggest that interventions may have a divergent effect on tau pathology.  
24730237	Novel L-lactide-depsipeptide polymeric carrier for enhanced brain uptake of rivastigmine in treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
J Biomed Nanotechnol  2014Mar
The present study discusses possibility of targeting an anti-Alzheimer's drug rivastigmine tartarate (RT) to the brain using novel synthesized L-lactide-depsipeptide polymeric nanoparticles (NPs). Single emulsion-solvent evaporation technique was used for preparation of NPs. The mean particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency of drug loaded NPs were found to be 142.2 +/- 21.3 nm, +4.85 mV and 60.72 +/- 3.72% respectively. Pharmacodynamic study showed faster regain of memory loss in amnesic rat with RT loaded NPs as compared to RT solution. In pharmacokinetic study, total concentration and mean residence time was increased up to 3.79 fold and 2 fold respectively while clearance was decreased to 1.91 fold on intravenous administration of RT loaded NPs as compared to RT solution. The biodistribution study demonstrated 5.45 fold and 2 fold increase in brain concentration of drug after administration of RT loaded NPs (i.v; 10.52 +/- 1.31 ng/ml) as compared to plain RT solution by oral (1.93 +/- 1.23 ng/ml) and intravenous (5.34 +/- 1.22 ng/ml) route, respectively. Therefore, RT loaded L-lactide-depsipeptide polymeric NPs might be a potential drug delivery system in treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
24077599	Neuropathologic changes associated with atrial fibrillation in a population-based autopsy cohort.
J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 20130928 2014May
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with higher risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. To better understand the mechanism, we examined neuropathologic changes seen with AF. We analyzed data from an autopsy series arising from a population-based, prospective cohort study set within Group Health, an integrated health care delivery system. Participants were people aged 65 and older, community-dwelling, and nondemented at study enrollment, who died during follow-up and underwent autopsy. AF was defined from medical records. Permanent AF was defined as having two or more electrocardiograms showing AF between 6 and 36 months apart with no evidence of sinus rhythm in between. The primary study outcomes were gross infarcts, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles, ascertained using consensus guidelines. Adjusted relative risks and 95% CIs were calculated using modified Poisson regression, weighted to account for selection into the autopsy cohort. Three hundred and twenty-eight participants underwent autopsy; 134 (41%) had AF. People with AF were more likely to have gross infarcts than those without AF (45% vs 31%; relative risk 1.82, 95% CI 1.23-2.71); in 30%, these infarcts were not clinically recognized before death. Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes were not associated with ever having AF but were more common in people with permanent AF. Adjusted relative risks for frequent neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were 1.47 (0.96-2.28) and 1.40 (0.79-2.49), respectively, for people with permanent AF versus no AF. AF is associated with gross infarcts. Permanent AF may contribute to Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes, but more study is needed. 
24381305	CD33: increased inclusion of exon 2 implicates the Ig V-set domain in Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.
Hum. Mol. Genet. 20131230 2014May15
We previously demonstrated that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated risk allele, rs3865444(C), results in a higher surface density of CD33 on monocytes. Here, we find alternative splicing of exon 2 to be the primary mechanism of the genetically driven differential expression of CD33 protein. We report that the risk allele, rs3865444(C), is associated with greater cell surface expression of CD33 in both subjects of European and African-American ancestry and that there is a single haplotype influencing CD33 surface expression. A meta-analysis of the two populations narrowed the number of significant SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2) &gt; 0.8) with rs3865444 to just five putative causal variants associated with increased protein expression. Using gene expression data from flow-sorted CD14(+)CD16(-) monocytes from 398 healthy subjects of three populations, we show that the rs3865444(C) risk allele is strongly associated with greater expression of CD33 exon 2 (pMETA = 2.36 Ã— 10(-60)). Western blotting confirms increased protein expression of the full-length CD33 isoform containing exon 2 relative to the rs3865444(C) allele (P &lt; 0.0001). Of the variants in strong LD with rs3865444, rs12459419, which is located in a putative SRSF2 splice site of exon 2, is the most likely candidate to mediate the altered alternative splicing of CD33's Immunoglobulin V-set domain 2 and ultimately influence AD susceptibility.  
24625917	Plasma homocysteine in Alzheimer's disease with or without co-morbid depressive symptoms.
Neuro Endocrinol. Lett.  2014
Elevated homocysteine is associated with a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depressive disorder. This study was designed to detect an association between plasma homocysteine and AD with or without co-morbid depressive symptoms. Plasma homocysteine concentrations were measured in 85 AD patients (36 of them with depressive symptoms), 33 non-AD patients with a depression diagnosis and 44 healthy controls, all aged above 50 years. Positive correlation between age and homocysteine was confirmed. Significantly higher mean plasma homocysteine was found in AD patients, but not in depressive patients, when compared with controls. We confirmed significant correlation between homocysteine concentration and the degree of cognitive impairment in AD patients. There was no incremental effect of concurrent depressive symptoms on homocysteine concentration in AD patients. The association of high homocysteine with degree of cognitive impairment or stage of dementia in AD indicate potential role of high plasma homocysteine as a biomarker of the disease and/or indicator of brain damage during the progression of AD dementia. 
24792094	ACE overexpression in myelomonocytic cells: effect on a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Curr. Hypertens. Rep.  2014Jul
While it is well known that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in blood pressure control, ACE also has effects on renal function, hematopoiesis, reproduction, and aspects of the immune response. ACE 10/10 mice overexpress ACE in myelomonocytic cells. Macrophages from these mice have an increased polarization towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype that results in a very effective immune response to challenge by tumors or bacterial infection. In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the ACE 10/10 phenotype provides significant protection against AD pathology, including reduced inflammation, reduced burden of the neurotoxic amyloid-Î² protein and preserved cognitive function. Taken together, these studies show that increased myelomonocytic ACE expression in mice alters the immune response to better defend against many different types of pathologic insult, including the cognitive decline observed in an animal model of AD. 
24372221	Oxidative stress mediated mitochondrial and vascular lesions as markers in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.
Curr. Med. Chem.  2014
Mitochondrial dysfunction plausibly underlies the aging-associated brain degeneration. Mitochondria play a pivotal role in cellular bioenergetics and cell-survival. Oxidative stress consequent to chronic hypoperfusion induces mitochondrial damage, which is implicated as the primary cause of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) mediated Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mitochondrial function deteriorates with aging, and the mitochondrial damage correlates with increased intracellular production of oxidants and pro-oxidants. The prolonged oxidative stress and the resultant hypoperfusion in the brain tissues stimulate the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes, which further drives the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The ROS and RNS collectively contributes to the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and damage to the brain parenchymal cells. Delineating the molecular mechanisms of these processes may provide clues for the novel therapeutic targets for CVA and AD patients.  
24712646	The vascular component of Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Neurovasc Res  2014May
Cognitive abilities depend primarily on cerebrovascular health and aging. In this work, we examine the pathogenic mechanisms of brain dysfunction linked to vascular risk factors, insulin signaling and cerebrovascular damage and explore how these mechanisms interfere with neurodegeneration. Although Abeta hypothesis prevails in the ethiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), it has become increasingly evident that disturbances in cerebral glucose metabolism is an invariant pathophysiological feature of AD and may provide an ubiquituos mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of AD. Currently, it is difficult to identify efficient therapeutic approach for brain protection and recovery, especially because we do not fully understand the underlying neurobiological processes, the nature of the pathophysiological mechanisms and the links between these two categories. Endogenous neurobiological processes, such as "brain reserves", neurotrophicity, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, are central to protection and recovery and represent the background of endogenous defense activity (EDA). The historical concept of neuroprotection being the suppression of pathophysiological processes by a single mechanism or molecule may have been effective in clinical practice, but is now obsolete and indicates a failure of the reductionist approach to neuroprotection in the clinical setting. Pharmacological intervention should address modulation not suppression. The more pathophysiological processes are modulated, the better the chances are for therapeutic success in brain protection and recovery. Therefore, drugs with pleiotropic neuroprotective mechanisms of action are the best candidates for acute neuroprotection.  
24613671	Altered lipid composition in cortical lipid rafts occurs at early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and facilitates APP/BACE1 interactions.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140211 2014Aug
The presence of lipid alterations in lipid rafts from the frontal cortex in late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently demonstrated. Here, we have isolated and analyzed the lipid composition of lipid rafts from different brain areas from control and AD subjects at initial neuropathologic stages. We have observed that frontal cortex lipid rafts are profoundly altered in AD brains from the earliest stages of AD, namely AD I/II. These changes in the lipid matrix of lipid rafts affected both lipid classes and fatty acids and were also detected in the entorhinal cortex, but not in the cerebellum from the same subjects. Paralleling these changes, lipid rafts from AD frontal and entorhinal cortices displayed higher anisotropy for environment-sensitive probes, indicating that lipid changes in AD lipid rafts increased membrane order and viscosity in these domains. The pathophysiological consequences of these alterations in the development and progression of AD were strengthened by the significant, and specific, accumulation of Î²-secretase within the lipid rafts of AD subjects even at the earliest stages. Our results provide a mechanistic connection between lipid alterations in these microdomains and amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein.  
24629673	Sleep deprivation impairs memory, tau metabolism, and synaptic integrity of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with plaques and tangles.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140215 2014Aug
Several studies have highlighted the frequency of sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether they are secondary to the disease or per se increase its risk remains to be fully investigated. The aim of the current investigation was to study the effect of sleep deprivation (SD) on the development of AD phenotype in a transgenic mouse model with plaques and tangles, the 3xTg mice. We evaluated the functional and biological consequences on 3xTg mice that underwent 4 hours sleep restrain per day for 8Â weeks. Compared with controls, behavioral assessment showed that SD-treated mice had a significant decline in their learning and memory. Although no differences were detected in the levels of soluble amyloid-Î² peptides, the same animals displayed a decrease in tau phosphorylation, which associated with a significant increase in its insoluble fraction. In addition, we observed that SD resulted in lower levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein levels. Finally, although total levels of the transcription factor cellular response element binding protein were unchanged, its phosphorylated form was significantly diminished in brains of sleep-deprived mice when compared with controls. Our study underlines the importance of SD as a chronic stressor, which by modulating biochemical processes influences the development of memory impairments and AD neuropathologies. Correction of SD could be a viable therapeutic strategy to prevent the onset or slow the progression of AD in individuals bearing this risk factor.  
24630757	Lack of association between CALHM1 p.P86L variation and Alzheimer's disease in the Han Chinese population.

In recent years, several studies have reported calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) was a potential gene related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility. However, whether CALHM1 p.P86L variation (rs2986017), a risk factor for AD is still controversial. Two independent studies have been performed in the Chinese population and the conclusions have not reached an agreement. In the present study, we performed a replication case-control study in 1301 Chinese subjects including 452 sporadic AD patients and 849 unrelated age and gender-matched controls, to determine whether this variation is a risk factor for AD in the Han Chinese population. We failed to replicate the positive association between the CALHM1 p.P86L variation and AD. In addition, we also examined p.P86L variation in a meta-analysis of 5 independent studies performed in Chinese and other Asian populations and negative association was found in total 2328 AD patients and 2865 controls. Our study suggests that CALHM1 p.P86L variation may not be an AD susceptibility factor in the Han Chinese population.  
24650791	Genetic variation of oxidative phosphorylation genes in stroke and Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140205 2014Aug
Previous research implicates alterations in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to test whether genetic variants within OXPHOS genes increase the risk of AD. We first used gene-set enrichment analysis to identify associations, and then applied a previously replicated stroke genetic risk score to determine if OXPHOS genetic overlap exists between stroke and AD. Gene-set enrichment analysis identified associations between variation in OXPHOS genes and AD versus control status (pÂ = 0.012). Conversion from cognitively normal controls to mild cognitive impairment was also associated with the OXPHOS gene-set (pÂ = 0.045). Subset analyses demonstrated association for complex I genes (p &lt; 0.05), but not for complexes II-V. Among neuroimaging measures, hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness were associated with OXPHOS genes (all p &lt; 0.025). The stroke genetic risk score demonstrated association with clinical status, baseline and longitudinal imaging measures (p &lt; 0.05). OXPHOS genetic variation influences clinical status and neuroimaging intermediates of AD. OXPHOS genetic variants associated with stroke are also linked to AD progression. Further studies are needed to explore functional consequences of these OXPHOS variants.  
24650793	Exosome reduction inÂ vivo is associated with lower amyloid plaque load in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140215 2014Aug
We present evidence here that exosomes stimulate aggregation of amyloid beta (AÎ²)1-42 inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo and interfere with uptake of AÎ² by primary cultured astrocytes and microglia inÂ vitro. Exosome secretion is prevented by the inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), a key regulatory enzyme generating ceramide from sphingomyelin, with GW4869. Using the 5XFAD mouse, we show that intraperitoneal injection of GW4869 reduces the levels of brain and serum exosomes, brain ceramide, and AÎ²1-42 plaque load. Reduction of total AÎ²1-42 as well as number of plaques in brain sections was significantly greater (40% reduction) in male than female mice. Our results suggest that GW4869 reduces amyloid plaque formation inÂ vivo by preventing exosome secretion and identifies nSMase2 as a potential drug target in AD by interfering with exosome secretion.  
24650794	Mutational analysis in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease inÂ Mainland China.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140220 2014Aug
Mutations of 3 causative genes, namely presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP), have been identified as the major causes of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD). Recently, a GGGGCC repeat expansion in the noncoding region of C9orf72 was also detected in some patients with clinically diagnosed familial Alzheimer's disease. The prevalence of causative gene mutations in patients with EOFAD has been reported in previous studies but their prevalence remains unclear in Mainland China. The aim of this study was to characterize the common causative gene mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese patients with EOFAD. Genetic screening for mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP was conducted in a total of 32 families with clinical diagnoses of EOFAD from Mainland China. Subsequently, a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 was detected in all patients. Four novel mutations in PSEN1 (p.A434T, p.I167del, p.F105C, and p.L248P) were identified in 4 respective families, and 1 previously recognized pathogenic mutation in APP (p.V717I) was detected in another 2 unrelated families. The PSEN2 mutation and pathogenic repeat expansions of C9orf72 were not detected in all patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cohort report of a causative gene screen in patients with EOFAD in Mainland China. The analysis of the genetic-clinical correlations in this cohort supports the idea that the clinical phenotype might be influenced by specific genetic defects.  
24679603	Hippocampus-specific deficiency in RNA editing of GluA2 in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140301 2014Aug
Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a base recoding process within precursor messenger RNA, catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. A notable example occurs at the Q/R site of the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptor subunit GluA2. Abnormally, low editing at this site leads to excessive calcium influx and cell death. We studied hippocampus and caudate samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched healthy controls, using direct sequencing and a high accuracy primer-extension technique to assess RNA editing at the Q/R GluA2 site. Both techniques revealed lower, more variable RNA editing in AD, specific to the hippocampus and the GluA2 site. Deficient editing also characterized the hippocampus of apolipoprotein Îµ4 allele carriers, regardless of clinical diagnosis. In AD, messenger RNA expression of neuronal markers was decreased in the hippocampus, and expression of the Q/R-site editing enzyme ADAR2 was decreased in caudate. These findings provide a link between neurodegenerative processes and deficient RNA editing of the GluA2 Q/R site, and may contribute to both diagnosis and treatment of AD.  
24680324	Plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels and risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140215 2014Aug
This study examines the association of plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) levels with all-cause dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Data are taken from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, a population-based study of a representative sample of persons aged more than 65 years conducted from 1991 to 2002. The present study sample included 670 subjects of which, 155 developed all-cause dementia with 109 cases of AD and 32 of vascular dementia. In Cox regression models, no association between OxLDL and risks of dementia or subtypes was found. A triple interaction between OxLDL, sex, and history of cardiovascular disease on the risk of AD (pÂ = 0.0077) was found. Increased levels of OxLDL were significantly associated with an increased risk of AD in men with a history of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratioÂ = 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.19); no association in women was found. These findings suggest that increased levels of OxLDL are not associated with the risk of dementia, AD, and vascular dementia. The association of OxLDL with AD in men with a history of cardiovascular disease merits further investigation.  
24685331	Exome array study did not identify novel variants in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140311 2014Aug
Genetic variants so far identified explain a small fraction of the overall inherited risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to identify novel genetic variants in AD using exome array that contains comprehensive panel. We genotyped 295,988 variants in 1005 subjects (400 AD cases and 605 controls) using Axiom Exome Genotyping Array that contains a pool of variants discovered in over 16 major human exome sequencing initiatives. Logistic regression analysis and the sequence kernel association optimal test were performed. The APOE, APOC1, and TOMM40 showed significant associations with AD in the single variant analysis. However, no significant association of other variants with AD was observed. This exome array study failed to identify novel genetic variants in AD.  
24394151	Type 2 diabetes and cognitive impairment: contributions from neuroimaging.
J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 20140105 2014Mar
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are major public health burdens associated with aging. As the age of the population rapidly increases, a sheer increase in the incidence of these diseases is expected. Research has identified T2D as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and potentially AD, but the neurobiological pathways that are affected are only beginning to be understood. The rapid advances in neuroimaging in the past decade have added significant understanding to how T2D affects brain structure and function and possibly lead to AD. This article provides a review of studies that have utilized structural and functional neuroimaging to identify neural pathways that link T2D to impaired cognitive performance and potentially AD. A primary focus of this article is the potential for neuroimaging to assist in understanding the mechanistic pathways that may provide translational opportunities for clinical intervention.  
24177719	The functional therapeutic chemical classification system.
Bioinformatics 20131030 2014Mar15
Drug repositioning is the discovery of new indications for compounds that have already been approved and used in a clinical setting. Recently, some computational approaches have been suggested to unveil new opportunities in a systematic fashion, by taking into consideration gene expression signatures or chemical features for instance. We present here a novel method based on knowledge integration using semantic technologies, to capture the functional role of approved chemical compounds. In order to computationally generate repositioning hypotheses, we used the Web Ontology Language to formally define the semantics of over 20 000 terms with axioms to correctly denote various modes of action (MoA). Based on an integration of public data, we have automatically assigned over a thousand of approved drugs into these MoA categories. The resulting new resource is called the Functional Therapeutic Chemical Classification System and was further evaluated against the content of the traditional Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System. We illustrate how the new classification can be used to generate drug repurposing hypotheses, using Alzheimers disease as a use-case. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ftc; https://github.com/loopasam/ftc. croset@ebi.ac.uk Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. 
24582000	Activated microglia do not form functional gap junctions in vivo.
J. Neuroimmunol. 20140213 2014Apr15
We investigated whether microglia form gap junctions with themselves, or with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or neurons in vivo in normal mouse brains, and in pathological conditions that induce microglial activation - brain injury and a model of Alzheimer's disease. Although microglia are in close physical proximity to glia and neurons, they do not form functional gap junctions under these pathological conditions.  
24132030	Multiple kernel learning in the primal for multimodal Alzheimer's disease classification.
IEEE J Biomed Health Inform 20131010 2014May
To achieve effective and efficient detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD), many machine learning methods have been introduced into this realm. However, the general case of limited training samples, as well as different feature representations typically makes this problem challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple kernel-learning framework to combine multimodal features for AD classification, which is scalable and easy to implement. Contrary to the usual way of solving the problem in the dual, we look at the optimization from a new perspective. By conducting Fourier transform on the Gaussian kernel, we explicitly compute the mapping function, which leads to a more straightforward solution of the problem in the primal. Furthermore, we impose the mixed L21 norm constraint on the kernel weights, known as the group lasso regularization, to enforce group sparsity among different feature modalities. This actually acts as a role of feature modality selection, while at the same time exploiting complementary information among different kernels. Therefore, it is able to extract the most discriminative features for classification. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
24752799	Design, synthesis and evaluation of seleno-dihydropyrimidinones as potential multi-targeted therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.
Org. Biomol. Chem. 20140422 2014Jun7
In this paper we report the design, synthesis and evaluation of a series of seleno-dihydropyrimidinones as potential multi-targeted therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. The compounds show excellent results as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, being as active as the standard drug. All these compounds also show very good antioxidant activity through different mechanisms of action.  
24579686	Clinical accuracy of the distinction between Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
Bratisl Lek Listy  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), although less prevalent overall, is almost as common as AD in patients under the age of 65. AD and FTLD are histopathologically distinct, with AD being characterised by extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, and FTLD by the presence of non-AD histological pathology, most commonly either tau-positive inclusions or ubiquitin-positive or TDP 43 positive inclusions. Clinically, AD and FTLD may occur with overlapping symptoms, especially in the early stages of the disease. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, it is represented by isolated decline of recent episodic memory; later on, by the impairment of time and space orientation, whereby the alteration of social behaviour and amnesic aphasia occur predominantly in the advanced phases of the disease. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is demonstrated in three clinical subunits: 1) The behavioural-dysexecutive variant of FTLD (frontotemporal dementia, the frontal variant of FTLD, {fvFTLD}), 2) Progressive non-fluent aphasia, 3) Semantic dementia (SD) with the profound impairment of social conduct (fvFTLD) or with severe speech impairment (PNFA, SD). Considering the different clinical symptomatology with FTLD diagnostics, it is necessary to use different psychometric tests than in the case of Alzheimer's disease. Therapy and the degree of dependence of the affected person are also different. All three diseases within the FTLD category, mainly the behavioural-dysexecutive variant, require a higher level of nursing care on the part of other persons or institutions in comparison with Alzheimer's disease. The goal of our publication is to point to the differences in clinical manifestation and the findings of auxiliary examinations that are helpful in the clinical accuracy of the distinction between these two types of dementia (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 18). 
24533944	MARK4 and MARK3 associate with early tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease granulovacuolar degeneration bodies.
Acta Neuropathol Commun 20140217 2014
The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an increase of phosphorylated tau in the brain. One of the earliest phosphorylated sites on tau is Ser262 that is preferentially phosphorylated by microtubule affinity regulating kinase (MARK), of which four isoforms exist. Herein we investigated the expression of MARK1-4 in the hippocampus of non-demented elderly (NDE) and AD cases. In situ hybridization revealed a uniform, neuronal distribution of all four isoform mRNAs in NDE and AD. Immunohistochemical analyses using isoform-selective antibodies demonstrated that MARK4 in a phosphorylated form colocalizes with p-tau Ser262 in granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVDs) that progressively accumulate in AD. In contrast MARK4 is largely absent in the neuronal cytoplasm. MARK3 was localized to a subset of the GVD-containing neurons and also had a weak general cytoplasmic neuronal staining in both NDE and AD. These results suggest that in AD, phosphorylated MARK3 and MARK4 are sequestered and proteolysed in GVDs. MARK1 and MARK2 were absent in GVDs and exhibited relatively uniform neuronal expressions with no apparent differences between NDE and AD. We found that the phosphorylated and fragmented forms of MARK4 and to some extent MARK3 are present in GVDs in AD, and that this expression is highly correlated with phosphorylation of tau at Ser262. This may represent a cellular defense mechanism to remove activated MARK and p-tau Ser262 from the cytosol, thereby reducing the phosphorylating effect on tau Ser262 that appears to be a critical step for subsequent neurodegeneration. 
24374316	Membrane lipid modifications and therapeutic effects mediated by hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid on Alzheimer's disease.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20131227 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathology with relevant unmet therapeutic needs. Both natural aging and AD have been associated with a significant decline in the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and accordingly, administration of DHA has been proposed as a possible treatment for this pathology. However, recent clinical trials in mild-to-moderately affected patients have been inconclusive regarding the real efficacy of DHA in halting this disease. Here, we show that the novel hydroxyl-derivative of DHA (2-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid - OHDHA) has a strong therapeutic potential to treat AD. We demonstrate that OHDHA administration increases DHA levels in the brain of a transgenic mouse model of AD (5xFAD), as well as those of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species that carry long polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In 5xFAD mice, administration of OHDHA induced lipid modifications that were paralleled with a reduction in amyloid-Î² (Î‘Î²) accumulation and full recovery of cognitive scores. OHDHA administration also reduced AÎ² levels in cellular models of AD, in association with alterations in the subcellular distribution of secretases and reduced AÎ²-induced tau protein phosphorylation as well. Furthermore, OHDHA enhanced the survival of neuron-like differentiated cells exposed to different insults, such as oligomeric AÎ² and NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity. These results were supported by model membrane studies in which incorporation of OHDHA into lipid-raft-like vesicles was shown to reduce the binding affinity of oligomeric and fibrillar AÎ² to membranes. Finally, the OHDHA concentrations used here did not produce relevant toxicity in zebrafish embryos in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrate the pleitropic effects of OHDHA that might prove beneficial to treat AD, which suggests that an upstream event, probably the modulation of the membrane lipid composition and structure, influences cellular homeostasis reversing the neurodegenerative process.

24754108	Drug treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
Nurs Times  2014 Feb 26-Mar 4
This article discusses the development and progress of treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Medical treatments have not changed since the late 1990s and have limited effects. They treat the symptoms patients experience but do not reverse the effects or repair neurological damage caused by Alzheimer's disease.

24150894	Sex and ESR1 genotype may influence the response to treatment with donepezil and rivastigmine in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20131022 2014Jun
Many factors could be responsible for the different response to treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) donepezil and rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Sex and the variants of the estrogen receptor Î± (ESR1) gene are reported to modulate AD susceptibility or the course of the disease. The aim of the present study was to verify whether patient's sex and ESR1 genotype could influence the response to ChEI treatment, as there is evidence that estrogens affect cholinergic system functioning. Two ESR1 intronic polymorphisms (PvuII, rs2234693; XbaI, rs9340799) were examined in 184 AD patients: 157 were receiving treatment with donepezil or rivastigmine and 27 were receiving no treatment. Cognitive status was assessed using the mini mental state examination at four time points (1, 3, 9, and 15 months into therapy). Among the patients under treatment with either ChEI, the women responded more markedly than the men. As compared with the untreated patients, the effects of treatment were statistically significant for both donepezil and rivastigmine. A significant effect of ESR1 genotypes was observed for the donepezil-treated patients, among which those carrying at least one copy of P and X alleles showed a significantly lower cognitive decline than the noncarriers. The present data seem to confirm a sex-related influence on treatment, as the women seemed to be more sensitive to therapy and to have experienced less cognitive decline. ESR1 may be another gene contributing to interindividual variability in response to treatment with ChEIs. 
24227657	Establishing robust cognitive dimensions for characterization and differentiation of patients with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia and depression.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20131114 2014Jun
The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia requires detailed neuropsychological examinations. These examinations typically yield a large number of outcome variables, which may complicate the interpretation and communication of results. The purposes of this study were the following: (i) to reduce a large data set of interrelated neuropsychological variables to a smaller number of cognitive dimensions; (ii) to create a common metric for these dimensions (z-scores); and (iii) to study the ability of the cognitive dimensions to distinguish between groups of patients with different types of cognitive impairment. We tested 1646 patients with different forms of dementia or with a major depression with a standard (n = 632) or, if cognitively less affected, a challenging neuropsychological battery (n = 1014). To identify the underlying cognitive dimensions of the two test batteries, maximum likelihood factor analyses with a promax rotation were conducted. To interpret the sum scores of the factors as standard scores, we divided them by the standard deviation of a cognitively healthy sample (n = 1145). The factor analyses yielded seven factors for each test battery. The cognitive dimensions in both test batteries distinguished patients with different forms of dementia (MCI, Alzheimer's dementia or frontotemporal dementia) and patients with major depression. Furthermore, patients with stable MCI could be separated from patients with progressing MCI. Discriminant analyses with an independent new sample of patients (n = 306) revealed that the new dimension scores distinguished new samples of patients with MCI from patients with Alzheimer's dementia with high accuracy. These findings suggest that these cognitive dimensions may benefit neuropsychological diagnostics.

24846973	[The effect of DNA methylation on Î²-amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease].
Yi Chuan  2014Apr
DNA methylation is the most intensively studied mechanism for epigenetic gene regulation. The functions of DNA methylation have recently drawn wide attention for investigation into the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been well established that Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) accumulation leads to the formation of senile plaques, which is a hallmark of AD pathology. Aggregation of AÎ² induces neurotoxicities manifested by apoptosis, neuroin-flammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction etc., which consequently provoke the pathological progression of AD. Previous studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating genes associated with the production, clearance and aggregation of AÎ². DNA methylation is a reversible process, making it a promising target for AD therapeutics. Further studies of DNA methylation in the initiation and progression of AD would pave the road to explore improved approaches to treat this disease. In this review, we summarize the involvement of DNA methylation in AÎ² accumulation as well as the associated pathological alterations during the initiation and progression of AD, which would help to fully appreciate the molecular basis of AD.  
24900939	Raised serum proinflammatory cytokines in Alzheimer's disease with depression.
Aging Dis 20140601 2014Jun
The purpose of the present study was to identify the changes in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1Î², IL-6 and TNF-Î± in peripheral circulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects and to correlate these with associated depression and cognitive deficit. Fifty five AD subjects and thirty seven age and sex matched controls were included in the study. The AD patients were grouped as AD with depression (n= 31) and AD without depression (n= 24). The serum levels of IL-1Î², IL-6 and TNF-Î± were determined by immunoassay by commercially available kits. The serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-Î± were elevated in AD patients with depression compared to control (p&lt;0.001) or AD without depression (p&lt;0.001). The serum level of IL-1Î² was higher in AD patients with or without depression as compared to controls. Furthermore, a strong inverse correlation was observed between the MMSE scores and serum levels of IL-6 or TNF-Î± in AD subjects with depression. The study highlights the important role of peripheral IL-6 and TNF-Î± in AD associated depression and cognitive deficits.  
24899907	Ligand-based and structure-based investigation for Alzheimer's disease from traditional chinese medicine.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140508 2014
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that was conventionally thought to be related to the sedimentation of beta-amyloids, but drugs designed according to this hypothesis have generally failed. That FKBP52 can reduce the accumulation of tau proteins, and that Tacrolimus can reduce the pathological changes of tau proteins are new directions away from the long held amyloid-beta-centric concept. Therefore, the screening of traditional Chinese medicine compounds for those with higher affinity towards FKBP52 than Tacrolimus may be a new direction for treating Alzheimer's disease. This study utilizes ligand-based and structure-based methods as the foundation. By utilizing dock scores and the predicted pIC50 from SVM, MLR, and Bayesian Network, several TCM compounds were selected for further analysis of their protein-ligand interactions. Daphnetoxin has higher affinity and complex structure stability than Tacrolimus; Lythrancine II exhibits the most identical trends in FKBP52 interactions as Tacrolimus, and 20-O-(2'E,4'E-decadienoyl)ingenol may be further modified at its hydrocarbon chain to promote interaction with FKBP52. In addition, we observed the residue Tyr113 of FKBP52 may play a key role in protein-ligand interaction. Our results indicate that Daphnetoxin, 20-O-(2'E,4'E-decadienoyl)ingenol, and Lythrancine II may be starting points for further modification as a new type of non-amyloid-beta-centric drug for Alzheimer's disease.  
24899909	In Silico Insight into Potent of Anthocyanin Regulation of FKBP52 to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140512 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein aggregation. FKBP52 (FK506 binding protein 52) has been found to inhibit Tau protein aggregation. This study found six different kinds of anthocyanins that have high binding potential. After analyzing the docking positions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bond interactions, several amino acids were identified that play important roles in protein and ligand interaction. The proteins' variation is described using eigenvectors and the distance between the amino acids during a molecular dynamics simulation (MD). This study investigates the three loops based around Glu85, Tyr113, and Lys121-all of which are important in inducing FKBP52 activation. By performing a molecular dynamic simulation process between unbound proteins and the protein complex with FK506, it was found that ligand targets that docked onto the FK1 domain will decrease the distance between Glu85/Tyr113 and Glu85/Lys121. The FKBP52 structure variation may induce FKBP52 activation and inhibit Tau protein aggregation. The results indicate that anthocyanins might change the conformation of FKBP52 during binding. In addition, the purple anthocyanins, such as cyanidin-3-glucoside and malvidin-3-glucoside, might be better than FK506 in regulating FKBP52 and treating Alzheimer's disease.  
24904413	Impairment of vocal expression of negative emotions in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140526 2014
Vocal expression of emotions (EE) in retrieval of events from autobiographical memory was investigated in patients in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Twenty-one AD patients and 19 controls were interviewed, and EE of the reported memories was rated by 8 independent evaluators. The AD group had lower EE of both recent and remote memory than controls, although EE in remote memories was better preserved in both groups. We observed positive correlations between EE and indicators of cognitive competence in AD patients. AD Patients are impaired in the ability to express emotions already at early stages of the disease, and EE seems to deteriorate along with the progression of cognitive impairment.  
24904414	Early Brain Loss in Circuits Affected by Alzheimer's Disease is Predicted by Fornix Microstructure but may be Independent of Gray Matter.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140528 2014
In a cohort of community-recruited elderly subjects with normal cognition at initial evaluation, we found that baseline fornix white matter (WM) microstructure was significantly correlated with early volumetric longitudinal tissue change across a region of interest (called fornix significant ROI, fSROI), which overlaps circuits known to be selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer's dementia pathology. Other WM and gray matter regions had much weaker or non-existent associations with longitudinal tissue change. Tissue loss in fSROI was in turn a significant factor in a survival model of cognitive decline, as was baseline fornix microstructure. These findings suggest that WM deterioration in the fornix and tissue loss in fSROI may be the early beginnings of posterior limbic circuit and default mode network degeneration. We also found that gray matter baseline volumes in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus predicted cognitive decline in survival models. But since GM regions did not also significantly predict brain-tissue loss, our results may imply a view in which early, prodromal deterioration appears as two quasi independent processes in white and gray matter regions of the limbic circuit crucial to memory.  
24904307	Selective alterations of neurons and circuits related to early memory loss in Alzheimer's disease.
Front Neuroanat 20140527 2014
A progressive loss of episodic memory is a well-known clinical symptom that characterizes Alzheimer's disease (AD). The beginning of this loss of memory has been associated with the very early, pathological accumulation of tau and neuronal degeneration observed in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Tau-related pathology is thought to then spread progressively to the hippocampal formation and other brain areas as the disease progresses. The major cortical afferent source of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus is the EC through the perforant pathway. At least two main circuits participate in the connection between EC and the hippocampus; one originating in layer II and the other in layer III of the EC giving rise to the classical trisynaptic (ECII â†’ dentate gyrus â†’ CA3 â†’ CA1) and monosynaptic (ECIII â†’ CA1) circuits. Thus, the study of the early pathological changes in these circuits is of great interest. In this review, we will discuss mainly the alterations of the granule cell neurons of the dentate gyrus and the atrophy of CA1 pyramidal neurons that occur in AD in relation to the possible differential alterations of these two main circuits.  
24671940	Ferrous iron formation following the co-aggregation of ferric iron and the Alzheimer's disease peptide Î²-amyloid (1-42).
J R Soc Interface 20140326 2014Jun6
For decades, a link between increased levels of iron and areas of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has been recognized, including AD lesions comprised of the peptide Î²-amyloid (AÎ²). Despite many observations of this association, the relationship between AÎ² and iron is poorly understood. Using X-ray microspectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron microscopy and spectrophotometric iron(II) quantification techniques, we examine the interaction between AÎ²(1-42) and synthetic iron(III), reminiscent of ferric iron stores in the brain. We report AÎ² to be capable of accumulating iron(III) within amyloid aggregates, with this process resulting in AÎ²-mediated reduction of iron(III) to a redox-active iron(II) phase. Additionally, we show that the presence of aluminium increases the reductive capacity of AÎ², enabling the redox cycling of the iron. These results demonstrate the ability of AÎ² to accumulate iron, offering an explanation for previously observed local increases in iron concentration associated with AD lesions. Furthermore, the ability of iron to form redox-active iron phases from ferric precursors provides an origin both for the redox-active iron previously witnessed in AD tissue, and the increased levels of oxidative stress characteristic of AD. These interactions between AÎ² and iron deliver valuable insights into the process of AD progression, which may ultimately provide targets for disease therapies.  
24444746	O-GlcNAc modification of tau directly inhibits its aggregation without perturbing the conformational properties of tau monomers.
J. Mol. Biol. 20140118 2014Apr17
The aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau into paired helical filaments to form neurofibrillary tangles constitutes one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Tau is post-translationally modified by the addition of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine O-linked to several serine and threonine residues (O-GlcNAc). Previously, increased O-GlcNAcylation of tau has been shown to block the accumulation of tau aggregates within a tauopathy mouse model. Here we show that O-GlcNAc modification of full-length human tau impairs the rate and extent of its heparin-induced aggregation without perturbing its activity toward microtubule polymerization. O-GlcNAcylation, however, does not impact the "global-fold" of tau as measured by a FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer assay. Similarly, nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation only minimally perturbs the local structural and dynamic features of a tau fragment (residues 353-408) spanning the last microtubule binding repeat to the major GlcNAc-acceptor Ser400. These data indicate that the inhibitory effects of O-GlcNAc on tau aggregation may result from enhanced monomer solubility or the destabilization of fibrils or soluble aggregates, rather than by altering the conformational properties of the monomeric protein. This work further underscores the potential of targeting the O-GlcNAc pathway for potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutics. 
24493463	Amyloid-Î² and tau: the trigger and bullet in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.
JAMA Neurol  2014Apr
The defining features of Alzheimer disease (AD) include conspicuous changes in both brain histology and behavior. The AD brain is characterized microscopically by the combined presence of 2 classes of abnormal structures, extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, both of which comprise highly insoluble, densely packed filaments. The soluble building blocks of these structures are amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides for plaques and tau for tangles. Amyloid-Î² peptides are proteolytic fragments of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein, whereas tau is a brain-specific, axon-enriched microtubule-associated protein. The behavioral symptoms of AD correlate with the accumulation of plaques and tangles, and they are a direct consequence of the damage and destruction of synapses that mediate memory and cognition. Synapse loss can be caused by the failure of live neurons to maintain functional axons and dendrites or by neuron death. During the past dozen years, a steadily accumulating body of evidence has indicated that soluble forms of AÎ² and tau work together, independently of their accumulation into plaques and tangles, to drive healthy neurons into the diseased state and that hallmark toxic properties of AÎ² require tau. For instance, acute neuron death, delayed neuron death following ectopic cell cycle reentry, and synaptic dysfunction are triggered by soluble, extracellular AÎ² species and depend on soluble, cytoplasmic tau. Therefore, AÎ² is upstream of tau in AD pathogenesis and triggers the conversion of tau from a normal to a toxic state, but there is also evidence that toxic tau enhances AÎ² toxicity via a feedback loop. Because soluble toxic aggregates of both AÎ² and tau can self-propagate and spread throughout the brain by prionlike mechanisms, successful therapeutic intervention for AD would benefit from detecting these species before plaques, tangles, and cognitive impairment become evident and from interfering with the destructive biochemical pathways that they initiate.  
24760838	Crtc1 activates a transcriptional program deregulated at early Alzheimer's disease-related stages.
J. Neurosci.  2014Apr23
Cognitive decline is associated with gene expression changes in the brain, but the transcriptional mechanisms underlying memory impairments in cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate relevant mechanisms responsible for transcriptional changes underlying early memory loss in AD by examining pathological, behavioral, and transcriptomic changes in control and mutant Î²-amyloid precursor protein (APPSw,Ind) transgenic mice during aging. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis using mouse microarrays revealed deregulation of a gene network related with neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and learning/memory in the hippocampus of APPSw,Ind mice after spatial memory training. Specifically, APPSw,Ind mice show changes on a cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcriptional program dependent on the CREB-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (Crtc1). Interestingly, synaptic activity and spatial memory induces Crtc1 dephosphorylation (Ser151), nuclear translocation, and Crtc1-dependent transcription in the hippocampus, and these events are impaired in APPSw,Ind mice at early pathological and cognitive decline stages. CRTC1-dependent genes and CRTC1 levels are reduced in human hippocampus at intermediate Braak III/IV pathological stages. Importantly, adeno-associated viral-mediated Crtc1 overexpression in the hippocampus efficiently reverses AÎ²-induced spatial learning and memory deficits by restoring a specific subset of Crtc1 target genes. Our results reveal a critical role of Crtc1-dependent transcription on spatial memory formation and provide the first evidence that targeting brain transcriptome reverses memory loss in AD.  
24760848	Suppression of Alzheimer-associated inflammation by microglial prostaglandin-E2 EP4 receptor signaling.
J. Neurosci.  2014Apr23
A persistent and nonresolving inflammatory response to accumulating AÎ² peptide species is a cardinal feature in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In response to accumulating AÎ² peptide species, microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, generate a toxic inflammatory response that accelerates synaptic and neuronal injury. Many proinflammatory signaling pathways are linked to progression of neurodegeneration. However, endogenous anti-inflammatory pathways capable of suppressing AÎ²-induced inflammation represent a relatively unexplored area. Here we report that signaling through the prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) EP4 receptor potently suppresses microglial inflammatory responses to AÎ²42 peptides. In cultured microglial cells, EP4 stimulation attenuated levels of AÎ²42-induced inflammatory factors and potentiated phagocytosis of AÎ²42. Microarray analysis demonstrated that EP4 stimulation broadly opposed AÎ²42-driven gene expression changes in microglia, with enrichment for targets of IRF1, IRF7, and NF-ÎºB transcription factors. In vivo, conditional deletion of microglial EP4 in APPSwe-PS1Î”E9 (APP-PS1) mice conversely increased inflammatory gene expression, oxidative protein modification, and AÎ² deposition in brain at early stages of pathology, but not at later stages, suggesting an early anti-inflammatory function of microglial EP4 signaling in the APP-PS1 model. Finally, EP4 receptor levels decreased significantly in human cortex with progression from normal to AD states, suggesting that early loss of this beneficial signaling system in preclinical AD development may contribute to subsequent progression of pathology.  
24618270	Pathophysiology of white matter perfusion in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
Brain 20140310 2014May
Little is known about the contributors and physiological responses to white matter hypoperfusion in the human brain. We previously showed the ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to proteolipid protein 1 in post-mortem human brain tissue correlates with the degree of ante-mortem ischaemia. In age-matched post-mortem cohorts of Alzheimer's disease (n = 49), vascular dementia (n = 17) and control brains (n = 33) from the South West Dementia Brain Bank (Bristol), we have now examined the relationship between the ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to proteolipid protein 1 and several other proteins involved in regulating white matter vascularity and blood flow. Across the three cohorts, white matter perfusion, indicated by the ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to proteolipid protein 1, correlated positively with the concentration of the vasoconstrictor, endothelin 1 (P = 0.0005), and negatively with the concentration of the pro-angiogenic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (P = 0.0015). The activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, which catalyses production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II was not altered. In samples of frontal white matter from an independent (Oxford, UK) cohort of post-mortem brains (n = 74), we confirmed the significant correlations between the ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to proteolipid protein 1 and both endothelin 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. We also assessed microvessel density in the Bristol (UK) samples, by measurement of factor VIII-related antigen, which we showed to correlate with immunohistochemical measurements of vessel density, and found factor VIII-related antigen levels to correlate with the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (P = 0.0487), suggesting that upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor tends to increase vessel density in the white matter. We propose that downregulation of endothelin 1 and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor in the context of reduced ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to proteolipid protein 1 are likely to be protective physiological responses to reduced white matter perfusion. Further analysis of the Bristol cohort showed that endothelin 1 was reduced in the white matter in Alzheimer's disease (P &lt; 0.05) compared with control subjects, but not in vascular dementia, in which endothelin 1 tended to be elevated, perhaps reflecting abnormal regulation of white matter perfusion in vascular dementia. Our findings demonstrate the potential of post-mortem measurement of myelin proteins and mediators of vascular function, to assess physiological and pathological processes involved in the regulation of cerebral perfusion in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.  
24625695	Regional distribution of synaptic markers and APP correlate with distinct clinicopathological features in sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease.
Brain 20140312 2014May
Recent studies suggest that subcortical structures, including striatum, are vulnerable to amyloid-Î² accumulation and other neuropathological features in familial Alzheimer's disease due to autosomal dominant mutations. We explored differences between familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease that might shed light on their respective pathogenic mechanisms. To this end, we analysed 12 brain regions, including neocortical, limbic and subcortical areas, from post-mortem brains of familial Alzheimer's disease (n = 10; age at death: 50.0 Â± 8.6 years) with mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin 1 (PSEN1), sporadic Alzheimer's disease (n = 19; age at death: 84.7 Â± 7.8 years), neurologically normal elderly without amyloid-Î² accumulation (normal ageing; n = 13, age at death: 82.9 Â± 10.8 years) and neurologically normal elderly with extensive cortical amyloid-Î² deposits (pathological ageing; n = 15; age at death: 92.7 Â± 5.9 years). The levels of amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚€, amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚‚, APP, apolipoprotein E, the synaptic marker PSD95 (now known as DLG4), the astrocyte marker GFAP, other molecules related to amyloid-Î² metabolism, and tau were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We observed that familial Alzheimer's disease had disproportionate amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚‚ accumulation in subcortical areas compared with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, whereas sporadic Alzheimer's disease had disproportionate amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚‚ accumulation in cortical areas compared to familial Alzheimer's disease. Compared with normal ageing, the levels of several proteins involved in amyloid-Î² metabolism were significantly altered in both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease; however, such changes were not present in pathological ageing. Among molecules related to amyloid-Î² metabolism, the regional distribution of PSD95 strongly correlated with the regional pattern of amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚‚ accumulation in sporadic Alzheimer's disease and pathological ageing, whereas the regional distribution of APP as well as Î²-C-terminal fragment of APP were strongly associated with the regional pattern of amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚‚ accumulation in familial Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E and GFAP showed negative regional association with amyloid-Î² (especially amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚€) accumulation in both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease. Familial Alzheimer's disease had greater striatal tau pathology than sporadic Alzheimer's disease. In a retrospective medical record review, atypical signs and symptoms were more frequent in familial Alzheimer's disease compared with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that disproportionate amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚‚ accumulation in cortical areas in sporadic Alzheimer's disease may be mediated by synaptic processes, whereas disproportionate amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚‚ accumulation in subcortical areas in familial Alzheimer's disease may be driven by APP and its processing. Region-specific amyloid-Î²â‚„â‚‚ accumulation might account for differences in the relative amounts of tau pathology and clinical symptoms in familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. 
24625697	Association of brain amyloid-Î² with cerebral perfusion and structure in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
Brain 20140312 2014May
Patients with Alzheimer's disease have reduced cerebral blood flow measured by arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging, but it is unclear how this is related to amyloid-Î² pathology. Using 182 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative we tested associations of amyloid-Î² with regional cerebral blood flow in healthy controls (n = 51), early (n = 66) and late (n = 41) mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease with dementia (n = 24). Based on the theory that Alzheimer's disease starts with amyloid-Î² accumulation and progresses with symptoms and secondary pathologies in different trajectories, we tested if cerebral blood flow differed between amyloid-Î²-negative controls and -positive subjects in different diagnostic groups, and if amyloid-Î² had different associations with cerebral blood flow and grey matter volume. Global amyloid-Î² load was measured by florbetapir positron emission tomography, and regional blood flow and volume were measured in eight a priori defined regions of interest. Cerebral blood flow was reduced in patients with dementia in most brain regions. Higher amyloid-Î² load was related to lower cerebral blood flow in several regions, independent of diagnostic group. When comparing amyloid-Î²-positive subjects with -negative controls, we found reductions of cerebral blood flow in several diagnostic groups, including in precuneus, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (dementia), inferior parietal cortex (late mild cognitive impairment and dementia), and inferior temporal cortex (early and late mild cognitive impairment and dementia). The associations of amyloid-Î² with cerebral blood flow and volume differed across the disease spectrum, with high amyloid-Î² being associated with greater cerebral blood flow reduction in controls and greater volume reduction in late mild cognitive impairment and dementia. In addition to disease stage, amyloid-Î² pathology affects cerebral blood flow across the span from controls to dementia patients. Amyloid-Î² pathology has different associations with cerebral blood flow and volume, and may cause more loss of blood flow in early stages, whereas volume loss dominates in late disease stages.  
24662516	Accumulation of oligomer-prone Î±-synuclein exacerbates synaptic and neuronal degeneration in vivo.
Brain 20140324 2014May
In Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, Î±-synuclein aggregates to form oligomers and fibrils; however, the precise nature of the toxic Î±-synuclein species remains unclear. A number of synthetic Î±-synuclein mutations were recently created (E57K and E35K) that produce species of Î±-synuclein that preferentially form oligomers and increase Î±-synuclein-mediated toxicity. We have shown that acute lentiviral expression of Î±-synuclein E57K leads to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons; however, the effects of chronic expression of oligomer-prone Î±-synuclein in synapses throughout the brain have not been investigated. Such a study could provide insight into the possible mechanism(s) through which accumulation of Î±-synuclein oligomers in the synapse leads to neurodegeneration. For this purpose, we compared the patterns of neurodegeneration and synaptic damage between a newly generated mThy-1 Î±-synuclein E57K transgenic mouse model that is prone to forming oligomers and the mThy-1 Î±-synuclein wild-type mouse model (Line 61), which accumulates various forms of Î±-synuclein. Three lines of Î±-synuclein E57K (Lines 9, 16 and 54) were generated and compared with the wild-type. The Î±-synuclein E57K Lines 9 and 16 were higher expressings of Î±-synuclein, similar to Î±-synuclein wild-type Line 61, and Line 54 was a low expressing of Î±-synuclein compared to Line 61. By immunoblot analysis, the higher-expressing Î±-synuclein E57K transgenic mice showed abundant oligomeric, but not fibrillar, Î±-synuclein whereas lower-expressing mice accumulated monomeric Î±-synuclein. Monomers, oligomers, and fibrils were present in Î±-synuclein wild-type Line 61. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses demonstrated that Î±-synuclein accumulated in the synapses but not in the neuronal cells bodies, which was different from the Î±-synuclein wild-type Line 61, which accumulates Î±-synuclein in the soma. Compared to non-transgenic and lower-expressing mice, the higher-expressing Î±-synuclein E57K mice displayed synaptic and dendritic loss, reduced levels of synapsin 1 and synaptic vesicles, and behavioural deficits. Similar alterations, but to a lesser extent, were seen in the Î±-synuclein wild-type mice. Moreover, although the oligomer-prone Î±-synuclein mice displayed neurodegeneration in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, the Î±-synuclein wild-type only displayed neuronal loss in the hippocampus. These results support the hypothesis that accumulating oligomeric Î±-synuclein may mediate early synaptic pathology in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies by disrupting synaptic vesicles. This oligomer-prone model might be useful for evaluating therapies directed at oligomer reduction.  
24785591	Confirmatory factor analysis of the quality of life in Alzheimer's disease scale in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Exp Aging Res  2014
BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: Quality of life (QoL) has become an important outcome measure in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) Scale is widely used for assessing QoL of patients with AD. This research aims to determine the factor structure of the QoL-AD Scale in AD patients. One hundred thirty-nine patients with mild-to-moderate AD were administered the QoL-AD Scale. Based on the model proposed for healthy people, confirmatory factor models were built using modification indices and residual analysis to improve the model fit. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated poor fit for both the initial model and the single-factor model. Two models showed a good fit: a three-factor model (perceived health, perceived environment and perceived functional ability) and a two-factor model (perceived physical health and perceived psychological health). Because no differences in fit were found between both models, the authors proposed the more parsimonious solution as the best model. These results provide evidence supporting the construct validity of the QoL-AD Scale. This instrument seems to measure the perception of two related constructs (behavioral competence and environment) and could be used together with instruments measuring psychological well-being and the perception of health. 
23627741	Taking each day as it comes: staff experiences of supporting people with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease in group homes.
J Intellect Disabil Res 20130430 2014Jun
Disability staff are being increasingly required to support adults with Down syndrome who develop Alzheimer's disease. They have little understanding of the nature of care required, and may lack input from aged care and dementia services, which lack knowledge of intellectual disability. The aim of this study was to report on the experiences of disability staff in group homes supporting residents with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease in relation to their under understanding of what was happening to these residents, their responses to them, and how they felt about their support role. Disability support staff for nine adults with Down syndrome who had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease were interviewed twice, over intervals of 6-9 months. Interviews were transcribed and analysed for themes. Three key themes emerged - (i) struggling to understand change, (ii) taking each day as it comes, and (iii) he's got a disability and that's our job. Staff had only limited understanding of how Alzheimer's disease impacted the adults with Down syndrome, their responses to changes were ad hoc, and they used strategies on a trial and error basis. They were committed to providing care, but at the risk of rejecting input and support. The need for collaboration across disability, and aged and disability care was evident to facilitate aging-in-place and planned care transitions. 
24795624	Physical activity reduces hippocampal atrophy in elders at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140423 2014
We examined the impact of physical activity (PA) on longitudinal change in hippocampal volume in cognitively intact older adults at varying genetic risk for the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hippocampal volume was measured from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans administered at baseline and at an 18-month follow-up in 97 healthy, cognitively intact older adults. Participants were classified as High or Low PA based on a self-report questionnaire of frequency and intensity of exercise. Risk status was defined by the presence or absence of the apolipoprotein E-epsilon 4 (APOE-Îµ4) allele. Four subgroups were studied: Low Risk/High PA (n = 24), Low Risk/Low PA (n = 34), High Risk/High PA (n = 22), and High Risk/Low PA (n = 17). Over the 18 month follow-up interval, hippocampal volume decreased by 3% in the High Risk/Low PA group, but remained stable in the three remaining groups. No main effects or interactions between genetic risk and PA were observed in control brain regions, including the caudate, amygdala, thalamus, pre-central gyrus, caudal middle frontal gyrus, cortical white matter (WM), and total gray matter (GM). These findings suggest that PA may help to preserve hippocampal volume in individuals at increased genetic risk for AD. The protective effects of PA on hippocampal atrophy were not observed in individuals at low risk for AD. These data suggest that individuals at genetic risk for AD should be targeted for increased levels of PA as a means of reducing atrophy in a brain region critical for the formation of episodic memories.  
24362760	Molecular drivers and cortical spread of lateral entorhinal cortex dysfunction in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
Nat. Neurosci. 20131222 2014Feb
The entorhinal cortex has been implicated in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by changes in the tau protein and in the cleaved fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We used a high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) variant that can map metabolic defects in patients and mouse models to address basic questions about entorhinal cortex pathophysiology. The entorhinal cortex is divided into functionally distinct regions, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), and we exploited the high-resolution capabilities of the fMRI variant to ask whether either of them was affected in patients with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Next, we imaged three mouse models of disease to clarify how tau and APP relate to entorhinal cortex dysfunction and to determine whether the entorhinal cortex can act as a source of dysfunction observed in other cortical areas. We found that the LEC was affected in preclinical disease, that LEC dysfunction could spread to the parietal cortex during preclinical disease and that APP expression potentiated tau toxicity in driving LEC dysfunction, thereby helping to explain regional vulnerability in the disease.  
24785894	Donepezil-induced cervical dystonia in Alzheimer's disease: a case report and literature review of dystonia due to cholinesterase inhibitors.
Intern. Med. 20140501 2014
We herein report an 81-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in who donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI), caused cervical dystonia. The patient had a two-year history of progressive memory disturbance fulfilling the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Mini-Mental State Examination score was 19/30. The remaining examination was normal. After a single administration of donepezil (5 mg/day) for 10 months, she complained of dropped head. Neurological examination and electrophysiological studies supported a diagnosis of cervical dystonia. Antecollis disappeared completely at 6 weeks after cessation of donepezil. Dystonic posture can occur at various timings of ChEI use. Physicians should pay more attention to rapidly progressive cervical dystonia in ChEI-treated AD patients.  
24142306	Neuroimaging and genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and addiction-related degenerative brain disorders.
Brain Imaging Behav  2014Jun
Neuroimaging offers a powerful means to assess the trajectory of brain degeneration in a variety of disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we describe how multi-modal imaging can be used to study the changing brain during the different stages of AD. We integrate findings from a range of studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Neuroimaging reveals how risk genes for degenerative disorders affect the brain, including several recently discovered genetic variants that may disrupt brain connectivity. We review some recent neuroimaging studies of genetic polymorphisms associated with increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Some genetic variants that increase risk for drug addiction may overlap with those associated with degenerative brain disorders. These common associations offer new insight into mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and addictive behaviors, and may offer new leads for treating them before severe and irreversible neurological symptoms appear.  
24203652	Graphical neuroimaging informatics: application to Alzheimer's disease.
Brain Imaging Behav  2014Jun
The Informatics Visualization for Neuroimaging (INVIZIAN) framework allows one to graphically display image and meta-data information from sizeable collections of neuroimaging data as a whole using a dynamic and compelling user interface. Users can fluidly interact with an entire collection of cortical surfaces using only their mouse. In addition, users can cluster and group brains according in multiple ways for subsequent comparison using graphical data mining tools. In this article, we illustrate the utility of INVIZIAN for simultaneous exploration and mining a large collection of extracted cortical surface data arising in clinical neuroimaging studies of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, mild cognitive impairment, as well as healthy control subjects. Alzheimer's Disease is particularly interesting due to the wide-spread effects on cortical architecture and alterations of volume in specific brain areas associated with memory. We demonstrate INVIZIAN's ability to render multiple brain surfaces from multiple diagnostic groups of subjects, showcase the interactivity of the system, and showcase how INVIZIAN can be employed to generate hypotheses about the collection of data which would be suitable for direct access to the underlying raw data and subsequent formal statistical analysis. Specifically, we use INVIZIAN show how cortical thickness and hippocampal volume differences between group are evident even in the absence of more formal hypothesis testing. In the context of neurological diseases linked to brain aging such as AD, INVIZIAN provides a unique means for considering the entirety of whole brain datasets, look for interesting relationships among them, and thereby derive new ideas for further research and study.  
24293121	Apolipoprotein E, gender, and Alzheimer's disease: an overlooked, but potent and promising interaction.
Brain Imaging Behav  2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasingly prevalent, fatal neurodegenerative disease that has proven resistant, thus far, to all attempts to prevent it, forestall it, or slow its progression. The Îµ4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) is a potent genetic risk factor for sporadic and late-onset familial AD. While the link between APOE4 and AD is strong, many expected effects, like increasing the risk of conversion from MCI to AD, have not been widely replicable. One critical, and commonly overlooked, feature of the APOE4 link to AD is that several lines of evidence suggest it is far more pronounced in women than in men. Here we review previous literature on the APOE4 by gender interaction with a particular focus on imaging-related studies.  
24317680	Imaging markers of structural and functional brain changes that precede cognitive symptoms in risk for Alzheimer's disease.
Brain Imaging Behav  2014Jun
Neuroimaging has rapidly advanced investigations into dysfunction both within and emanating from the hippocampus in early Alzheimer's disease . Focusing on prodromal subjects, we will discuss structural changes to hippocampal subregions, alterations to functional activity both within the hippocampus and elsewhere in the cortex, as well as changes to structural white matter connectivity and changes to functionally correlated patterns during memory performance. We present ample evidence that asymptomatic subjects demonstrate substantial identifiable brain changes before the onset of cognitive decline, but suggest there is significant work yet to be accomplished before applying these findings to individual patients.  
24742666	The lateralized smell test for detecting Alzheimer's disease: failure to replicate.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20140319 2014May15
A widely publicized study by Stamps, Bartoshuk and Heilman (2013) reported that a simple measure of left:right naris differences in the ability to detect the odor of peanut butter is a sensitive marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD patients were said to have abnormal smell function on the left side of the nose and normal function on right side of the nose. In light of its implications for medical practice and the world-wide publicity that it engendered, we sought to replicate and expand this work. Two studies were performed. In the first, 15 AD patients were tested according to the procedures described by Stamps et al. in which the nostril contralateral to the tested side was occluded by the patient using lateral pressure from the index finger. Since this can potentially distort the contralateral naris, we repeated the testing using tape for naris occlusion. In the second, 20 AD patients were administered 20 odors of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) to each side of the nose, with the contralateral naris being closed with tape. In both studies, the order of the side of testing was systematically counterbalanced. No evidence of a left:right asymmetry on any test measure was observed. Although hyposmia is well-established in AD, no meaningful asymmetry in smell perception is apparent. If olfactory function on the right side of the nose was normal as claimed, then AD patients should exhibit normal function when tested bilaterally, a phenomenon not seen in dozens of AD-related olfactory studies. 
24812571	Integrating gene expression and protein interaction data for signaling pathway prediction of Alzheimer's disease.
Comput Math Methods Med 20140409 2014
Discovering the signaling pathway and regulatory network would provide significant advance in genome-wide understanding of pathogenesis of human diseases. Despite the rich transcriptome data, the limitation for microarray data is unable to detect changes beyond transcriptional level and insufficient in reconstructing pathways and regulatory networks. In our study, protein-protein interaction (PPI) data is introduced to add molecular biological information for predicting signaling pathway of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Combining PPI with gene expression data, significant genes are selected by modified linear regression model firstly. Then, according to the biological researches that inflammation reaction plays an important role in the generation and deterioration of AD, NF- Îº B (nuclear factor-kappa B), as a significant inflammatory factor, has been selected as the beginning gene of the predicting signaling pathway. Based on that, integer linear programming (ILP) model is proposed to reconstruct the signaling pathway between NF- Îº B and AD virulence gene APP (amyloid precursor protein). The results identify 6 AD virulence genes included in the predicted inflammatory signaling pathway, and a large amount of molecular biological analysis shows the great understanding of the underlying biological process of AD.  
23891615	Therapeutic and preventive effects of methylene blue on Alzheimer's disease pathology in a transgenic mouse model.
Neuropharmacology 20130723 2014Jan
Methylene blue (MB) belongs to the phenothiazinium family. It has been used to treat a variety of human conditions and has beneficial effects on the central nervous system in rodents with and without brain alteration. The present study was designed to test whether chronic MB treatment taken after (therapeutic effect) or before (preventive effect) the onset of beta-amyloid pathology influences cognition in a transgenic mouse model (APP/PS1). In addition, the present study aims at revealing whether these behavioral effects might be related to brain alteration in beta-amyloid deposition. To this end, we conducted an inÂ vivo study and compared two routes of drug administration, drinking water versus intraperitoneal injection. Results showed that transgenic mice treated with MB orally or following intraperitoneal injection were protected from cognitive impairments in a variety of social, learning, and exploratory tasks. Immunoreactive beta-amyloid deposition was significantly reduced in the hippocampus and adjacent cortex in MB-treated transgenic mice. Interestingly, these beneficial effects were observed independently of beta-amyloid load at the time of MB treatment. This suggests that MB treatment is beneficial at both therapeutic and preventive levels. Using solid-state High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS-NMR), we showed that MB administration after the onset of amyloid pathology significantly restored the concentration of two metabolites related to mitochondrial metabolism, namely alanine and lactate. We conclude that MB might be useful for the therapy and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'The Synaptic Basis of Neurodegenerative Disorders'.  
23891641	Therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease: Past, present and future.
Neuropharmacology 20130725 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. The etiology is multifactorial, and pathophysiology of the disease is complex. Data indicate an exponential rise in the number of cases of AD, emphasizing the need for developing an effective treatment. AD also imposes tremendous emotional and financial burden to the patient's family and community. The disease has been studied over a century, but acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are the only drugs currently approved for its management. These drugs provide symptomatic improvement alone but doÂ less to modify the disease process. The extensive insight into the molecular and cellular pathomechanism in AD over the past few decades has provided us significant progress in the understanding of the disease. A number of novel strategies that seek to modify the disease process have been developed. The major developments in this direction are the amyloid and tau based therapeutics, which could hold the key to treatment of AD in the near future. Several putative drugs have been thoroughly investigated in preclinical studies, but many of them have failed to produce results in the clinical scenario; therefore it is only prudent that lessons be learnt from the past mistakes. The current rationales and targets evaluated for therapeutic benefit in AD are reviewed in this article. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'The Synaptic Basis of Neurodegenerative Disorders'.  
23973293	Liraglutide can reverse memory impairment, synaptic loss and reduce plaque load in aged APP/PS1 mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropharmacology 20130821 2014Jan
Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been shown that insulin signalling is desensitised in the brains of AD patients. The incretin hormone Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) facilitates insulin signalling, and long-lasting analogues such as liraglutide (Victoza(Â®)) are on the market as type 2 diabetes treatments. We have previously shown that liraglutide improved cognitive function, reduced amyloid plaque deposition, inflammation, overall APP and oligomer levels and enhanced LTP when injected peripherally for two months in 7 month old APPswe/PS1Î”E9 (APP/PS1) mice. This showed that liraglutide has preventive effects at the early stage of AD development. The current study investigated whether Liraglutide would have restorative effects in late-stage Alzheimer's disease in mice. Accordingly, 14-month-old APP/PS1 and littermate control mice were injected with Liraglutide (25Â nmol/kgÂ bw) ip. for 2 months. Spatial memory was improved by Liraglutide-treatment in APP/PS1 mice compared with APP/PS1 saline-treated mice. Overall plaque load was reduced by 33%, and inflammation reduced by 30%, while neuronal progenitor cell count in the dentate gyrus was increased by 50%. LTP was significantly enhanced in APP/PS1 liraglutide-treated mice compared with APP/PS1 saline mice, corroborated with increased synapse numbers in hippocampus and cortex. Total brain APP and beta-amyloid oligomer levels were reduced in Liraglutide-treated APP/PS1 mice while IDE levels were increased. These results demonstrate that Liraglutide not only has preventive properties, but also can reverse some of the key pathological hallmarks of AD. Liraglutide is now being tested in clinical trials in AD patients. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'The Synaptic Basis of Neurodegenerative Disorders'.  
23973316	Dysfunctional synapse in Alzheimer's disease - A focus on NMDA receptors.
Neuropharmacology 20130822 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly. Alterations capable of causing brain circuitry dysfunctions in AD may take several years to develop. Oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide (AÎ²) plays a complex role in the molecular events that lead to progressive loss of function and eventually to neurodegeneration in this devastating disease. Moreover, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) activation has been recently implicated in AD-related synaptic dysfunction. Thus, in this review we focus on glutamatergic neurotransmission impairment and the changes in NMDAR regulation in AD, following the description on the role and location of NMDARs at pre- and post-synaptic sites under physiological conditions. In addition, considering that there is currently no effective ways to cure AD or stop its progression, we further discuss the relevance of NMDARs antagonists to prevent AD symptomatology. This review posits additional information on the role played by AÎ² in AD and the importance of targeting the tripartite glutamatergic synapse in early asymptomatic and possible reversible stages of the disease through preventive and/or disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'The Synaptic Basis of Neurodegenerative Disorders'. 
24029236	Predominant loss of glutamatergic terminal markers in a Î²-amyloid peptide model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropharmacology 20130909 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized phenotypically by memory impairment, neurochemically by accumulation of Î²-amyloid peptide (such as AÎ²1-42) and morphologically by an initial loss of nerve terminals in cortical and hippocampal regions. However, it is not known what nerve terminals are mostly affected in early AD. We now used a mouse model of AD, based on the intra-cerebral administration of soluble AÎ²1-42, that leads to memory impairment and loss of nerve terminal markers within 2 weeks, to investigate which type of hippocampal nerve terminals was mostly affected in the hippocampus. Western blot analysis revealed a decrease of the density of vesicular glutamate transporters type 1 (vGluT1, a marker of glutamatergic terminals;Â -20.1Â Â±Â 3.6%) and of vesicular acetylcholine transporters (vAChT, a marker of cholinergic terminals;Â -27.2Â Â±Â 0.9%) but not of vesicular GABA transporters (vGAT, a marker of GABAergic terminals) in the hippocampus of AÎ²-injected mice. Immunocytochemical analysis of single hippocampal nerve terminals revealed that the decrease of the density of vGluT1 reflects a reduction of the number of vGluT1-immunopositive nerve terminals (-10.6Â Â±Â 3.6%), while no significant changes in the number of vAChT- or vGAT-immunopositive nerve terminals were observed. This pilot study shows that, in this AÎ²-based model of AD, there is an asymmetric loss of different synaptic markers with a predominant susceptibility of glutamatergic synapses. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'The Synaptic Basis of Neurodegenerative Disorders'.  
24076336	A role for tau at the synapse in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
Neuropharmacology 20130925 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by brain deposition of amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles along with steady cognitive decline. Although the mechanism by which AD pathogenesis occurs is unclear, accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction and loss of synaptic connections may be an early event underlying disease progression. Profound synapse degeneration is observed in AD, and the density of these connections strongly correlates with cognitive ability. Initial investigations into AD-related synaptic changes focused on the toxic effects of amyloid. However, recent research suggests an emerging role for tau at the synapse. Even in the absence of tangles, mice overexpressing human tau display significant synaptic degeneration, suggesting that soluble, oligomeric tau is the synaptotoxic species. However, the localization of tau within synapses in both healthy and AD brains indicates that tau might play a role in normal synaptic function, which may be disrupted in disease. Tau is able to impact synaptic activity in several ways: studies show tau interacting directly with post-synaptic signaling complexes, regulating glutamatergic receptor content in dendritic spines, and influencing targeting and function of synaptic mitochondria. Early trials of tau-targeted immunotherapy reduce tau pathology and synapse loss, indicating that the toxic effects of tau may be reversible within a certain time frame. Understanding the role of tau in both normal and degenerating synapses is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies designed to ameliorate synapse loss and prevent AD pathogenesis. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'The Synaptic Basis of Neurodegenerative Disorders'.  
24410826	Trafficking regulation of proteins in Alzheimer's disease.
Mol Neurodegener 20140111 2014
The Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) peptide has been postulated to be a key determinant in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AÎ² is produced through sequential cleavage of the Î²-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Î²- and Î³-secretases. APP and relevant secretases are transmembrane proteins and traffic through the secretory pathway in a highly regulated fashion. Perturbation of their intracellular trafficking may affect dynamic interactions among these proteins, thus altering AÎ² generation and accelerating disease pathogenesis. Herein, we review recent progress elucidating the regulation of intracellular trafficking of these essential protein components in AD.  
24454724	Specific disruption of hippocampal mossy fiber synapses in a mouse model of familial Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140113 2014
The earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by deficits in memory and cognition indicating hippocampal pathology. While it is now recognized that synapse dysfunction precedes the hallmark pathological findings of AD, it is unclear if specific hippocampal synapses are particularly vulnerable. Since the mossy fiber (MF) synapse between dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 regions underlies critical functions disrupted in AD, we utilized serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) to analyze MF microcircuitry in a mouse model of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). FAD mutant MF terminal complexes were severely disrupted compared to control - they were smaller, contacted fewer postsynaptic spines and had greater numbers of presynaptic filopodial processes. Multi-headed CA3 dendritic spines in the FAD mutant condition were reduced in complexity and had significantly smaller sites of synaptic contact. Significantly, there was no change in the volume of classical dendritic spines at neighboring inputs to CA3 neurons suggesting input-specific defects in the early course of AD related pathology. These data indicate a specific vulnerability of the DG-CA3 network in AD pathogenesis and demonstrate the utility of SBEM to assess circuit specific alterations in mouse models of human disease.  
24596009	Morphometric measurements of MRI findings in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Adv Clin Exp Med  2014 Jan-Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common degenerative neurological disorders among elderly people, and is associated with progressive cerebral atrophy. AD is characterized by deterioration of the memory, difficulties with language, alterations in behavior and dysfunction in daily activities. The purpose of the present study was to measure the total volumes of different parts of the brain of AD patients and healthy gender-matched controls using Cavalieri's volume estimate method, and to establish some brain ratios. Moreover, the authors wanted to test this method in measuring the volumes of various parts of the brain from MRI scans. In this study, the MRI scans of 15 right-handed individuals with probable AD and 10 healthy controls were assessed. Cavalieri's volume estimate method was applied to the brain MRI scans to calculate the volumes of various parts of the brain. While the measurements showed a marked increase in the volume of cerebral ventricles and sulci in AD patients in comparison to the gender-matched controls, the volumes of cortical gray matter and cerebral hemispheric brain matter were reduced considerably. However, no significant differences were detected in the volume of the cerebellum + brainstem or intracranium in AD patients. There were also no major variations between male and female values of the two groups. Overall, cerebral hemisphere and cortical gray matter atrophies were the most remarkable findings among AD patients in the present study; consequently, expansions of both the ventricles and subarachnoid space were formed. Cavalieri's volume estimate method was very efficient in calculating the volumes of different parts of brain from the MRI scans of both groups.

24670887	Late-onset Alzheimer disease genetic variants in posterior cortical atrophy and posterior AD.
Neurology 20140326 2014Apr22
To investigate association of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) with risk of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a syndrome of visual impairment with predominant Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology in posterior cortical regions, and with risk of "posterior AD" neuropathology. We assessed 81 participants with PCA diagnosed clinically and 54 with neuropathologic diagnosis of posterior AD vs 2,523 controls for association with 11 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from published LOAD risk genome-wide association studies. There was highly significant association with APOE Îµ4 and increased risk of PCA (p = 0.0003, odds ratio [OR] = 3.17) and posterior AD (p = 1.11 Ã— 10(-17), OR = 6.43). No other locus was significant after corrections for multiple testing, although rs11136000 near CLU (p = 0.019, OR = 0.60) and rs744373 near BIN1 (p = 0.025, OR = 1. 63) associated nominally significantly with posterior AD, and rs3851179 at the PICALM locus had significant association with PCA (p = 0.0003, OR = 2.84). ABCA7 locus SNP rs3764650, which was also tested under the recessive model because of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, also had nominally significant association with PCA risk. The direction of association at APOE, CLU, and BIN1 loci was the same for participants with PCA and posterior AD. The effects for all SNPs, except rs3851179, were consistent with those for LOAD risk. We identified a significant effect for APOE and nominate CLU, BIN1, and ABCA7 as additional risk loci for PCA and posterior AD. Our findings suggest that at least some of the genetic risk factors for LOAD are shared with these atypical conditions and provide effect-size estimates for their future genetic studies. 
24719490	Faster cognitive decline in elders without dementia and decreased risk of cancer mortality: NEDICES Study.
Neurology 20140409 2014Apr22
To assess whether faster cognitive decline in elders without dementia is associated with decreased risk of cancer mortality. In this population-based, prospective study of 2,627 people without dementia aged 65 years and older (Neurological Disorders in Central Spain), a 37-item version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (37-MMSE) was administered at 2 visits (baseline and follow-up, approximately 3 years later). We divided change in 37-MMSE into tertiles (lower tertile â‰¥ 2 point improvement in score, higher tertile â‰¥ 2 point decline in score). Community-dwelling elders were followed for a median of 12.9 years, after which the death certificates of those who died were examined. A total of 1,003 (38.2%) died, including 339 (33.8%) deaths among participants who were in the higher tertile of 37-MMSE change and 664 (66.2%) deaths among those in the remaining tertiles. Cancer was reported significantly less often in those in the higher tertile of MMSE change (20.6%) than in those in the remaining tertiles (28.6%): in an unadjusted Cox model, hazard ratio for cancer mortality in participants within the higher tertile = 0.75 (p = 0.04) compared with the participants within the remaining tertiles. In a Cox model that adjusted for a variety of demographic factors and comorbidities, hazard ratio for cancer mortality in participants within the higher tertile = 0.70 (p = 0.01). In this population-based, prospective study of community-dwelling elders without dementia, faster cognitive decline was associated with a decreased risk of cancer mortality. Further studies are required to elucidate this inverse association in elders without dementia. 
24667360	Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition by Pterocarpus marsupium and Eugenia jambolana ameliorates streptozotocin induced Alzheimer's disease.
Behav. Brain Res. 20140322 2014Jul1
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the loss of normal functions of brain cells and neuronal death, ultimately leading to memory loss. Recent accumulating evidences have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of anti-diabetic agents, such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), providing opportunities to explore and test the DPP-4 inhibitors for treating this fatal disease. Prior studies determining the efficacy of Pterocarpus marsupium (PM, Fabaceae) and Eugenia jambolana (EJ, Myrtaceae) extracts for ameliorating type 2 diabetes have demonstrated the DPP-4 inhibitory properties indicating the possibility of using of these extracts even for the treating AD. Therefore, in the present study, the neuroprotective roles of PM and EJ for ameliorating the streptozotocin (STZ) induced AD have been tested in rat model. Experimentally, PM and EJ extracts, at a dose range of 200 and 400mg/kg, were administered orally to STZ induced AD Wistar rats and cognitive evaluation tests were performed using radial arm maze and hole-board apparatus. Following 30 days of treatment with the extracts, a dose- and time-dependent attenuation of AD pathology, as evidenced by decreasing amyloid beta 42, total tau, phosphorylated tau and neuro-inflammation with an increase in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels was observed. Therefore, PM and EJ extracts contain cognitive enhancers as well as neuroprotective agents against STZ induced AD.  
24681055	Effect of troxerutin on synaptic plasticity of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons in a Î²-amyloid model of Alzheimer×³s disease: an electrophysiological study.
Eur. J. Pharmacol. 20140325 2014Jun5
Alzheimer×³s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Multiple pathogenetic factors including aggregated Î²-amyloid (AÎ²), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cholinergic dysfunction and oxidative stress are involved in AD. AÎ², a major constituent of the senile plaques, is a potent neurotoxic peptide and has a pivotal role in cognitive deficit and reduced synaptic plasticity in AD. In the present study we examined the protective effect of troxerutin, as a multipotent bioflavonoid, on AÎ² (1-42)-induced impairment of evoked field potential in hippocampal DG neurons. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups including AÎ² (42-1), AÎ² (1-42), AÎ² (1-42) plus troxerutin and AÎ² (42-1) plus troxerutin groups. AÎ² was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) into right lateral ventricle and after two weeks the evoked field potential recorded from perforant path-DG synapses to assess paired pulse paradigm and long term potentiation (LTP). Administration of AÎ² (1-42) drastically attenuated the LTP of DG neurons, while there was no significant difference in evoked field potentials between AÎ² (1-42) plus troxerutin group with respect to AÎ² (42-1) group. This study revealed that troxerutin improves the synaptic failure induced by AÎ² peptide and can be introduced as a promising multi-potent pharmacological agent in prevention or treatment of AD in the future.  
24594196	Familial Alzheimer's disease sustained by presenilin 2 mutations: systematic review of literature and genotype-phenotype correlation.
Neurosci Biobehav Rev 20140302 2014May
Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), despite representing a rare condition, is attracting a growing interest in the scientific community. Improved phenotyping of FAD cases may have a relevant impact both in clinical and research contexts. We performed a systematic review of studies describing the phenotypic features of FAD cases sustained by PSEN2 mutations, the less common cause of monogenic AD. Special attention was given to the clinical manifestations as well as to the main findings coming from the most commonly and widely adopted diagnostic procedures. Basing on the collected data, we also attempted to conduct a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis. Overall, the mutations involving the PSEN2 gene represent an extremely rare cause of FAD, having been reported to date in less than 200 cases. They are mainly associated, despite some peculiar and heterogeneous features, to a typical AD phenotype. Nevertheless, the frequent occurrence of psychotic symptoms may represent a potential distinctive element. The scarcity of available phenotypic descriptions strongly limits the implementation of genotype-phenotype correlations.

24457963	c-Jun N-terminal kinase has a key role in Alzheimer disease synaptic dysfunction in vivo.
Cell Death Dis 20140123 2014
Altered synaptic function is considered one of the first features of Alzheimer disease (AD). Currently, no treatment is available to prevent the dysfunction of excitatory synapses in AD. Identification of the key modulators of synaptopathy is of particular significance in the treatment of AD. We here characterized the pathways leading to synaptopathy in TgCRND8 mice and showed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated at the spine prior to the onset of cognitive impairment. The specific inhibition of JNK, with its specific inhibiting peptide D-JNKI1, prevented synaptic dysfunction in TgCRND8 mice. D-JNKI1 avoided both the loss of postsynaptic proteins and glutamate receptors from the postsynaptic density and the reduction in size of excitatory synapses, reverting their dysfunction. This set of data reveals that JNK is a key signaling pathway in AD synaptic injury and that its specific inhibition offers an innovative therapeutic strategy to prevent spine degeneration in AD.  
24497071	Anti-dementia drugs and co-medication among patients with Alzheimer's disease : investigating real-world drug use in clinical practice using the Swedish Dementia Quality Registry (SveDem).
Drugs Aging  2014Mar
There is a substantial risk of drug-interactions, adverse events, and inappropriate drug use (IDU) among frail Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients; however, there are few studies about co-medication and IDU in clinical settings. To investigate anti-dementia drugs, associated characteristics of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and NMDA antagonists, co-medication, and IDU in a large population of outpatients with mild AD. In this cross-sectional analysis of medication characteristics, we analyzed data from the Swedish Dementia Quality Registry (SveDem) on 5,907 newly diagnosed AD patients who were registered in memory clinics. SveDem is a national quality registry in Sweden, which was established in 2007 to evaluate and improve dementia healthcare. Comparisons were performed concerning co-medications, use of â‰¥3 psychotropic drugs (IDU) and polypharmacy (â‰¥5 drugs) based on anti-dementia treatment (ChEIs or NMDA antagonists). Information on baseline characteristics such as age, sex, living conditions, cognitive evaluation based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and diagnostic work-up was also evaluated. The majority of the AD patients were in the mild stage of the disease. Overall, 4,342 (75.4 %) patients received any ChEI, 438 (7.6 %) used an NMDA antagonist and 74 (1.3 %) patients were treated with both. However, 907 (15.7 %) patients were not treated with any anti-dementia drug. While polypharmacy was seen in 33.5 % of patients, only 2.6 % concurrently used â‰¥3 psychotropic medications. Patients on ChEIs were significantly younger, had a higher MMSE score and were treated with a smaller number of medications (a proxy for overall co-morbidity). Co-medication with antipsychotics [3.3 vs. 7.6 %; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.55 (95 % CI 0.38-0.79)] and anxiolytics [5.8 vs. 10.9 %; adjusted OR 0.62 (95 % CI 0.46-0.84)] was significantly lower in the ChEI+ group than in those with no anti-dementia treatment. Patients taking ChEIs were treated with less antipsychotics and anxiolytics than those not taking ChEIs. More research is warranted to elucidate whether use of ChEIs in clinical practice can reduce the need for psychotropic drugs in AD patients. 
24118559	Influence of age, disease onset and ApoE4 on visual medial temporal lobe atrophy cut-offs.
J. Intern. Med. 20131030 2014Mar
Visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA; range 0-4, from no atrophy to increasing atrophy of the choroid fissure, temporal horns and hippocampus) is a sensitive radiological marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the critical elements for visual MTA assessment is the cut-off score that determines deviation from normality. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of different MTA cut-off scores to classify control subjects, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients from two large independent cohorts, AddNeuroMed and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Of note, we evaluated the effects of clinical, demographic and genetic variables on the classification performance according to the different cut-offs. A cut-off of â‰¥1.5 based on the mean MTA scores of both hemispheres showed higher sensitivity in classifying patients with AD (84.5%) and MCI subjects (75.8%) who converted to dementia compared to an age-dependent cut-off. The age-dependent cut-off showed higher specificity or ability to correctly identify control subjects (83.2%) and those with MCI who remained stable (65.5%). Increasing age, early-onset disease and absence of the ApoE Îµ4 allele had a stronger influence on classifications using the â‰¥1.5 cut-off. Above 75 years of age, an alternative cut-off of â‰¥2.0 should be applied to achieve a classification accuracy for both patients with AD and control subjects that is clinically useful. Clinical, demographic and genetic variables can influence the classification of MTA cut-off scores, leading to misdiagnosis in some cases. These variables, in addition to the differential sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off, should be carefully considered when performing visual MTA assessment. 
24037325	Distinctive features of microsaccades in Alzheimer's disease and in mild cognitive impairment.
Age (Dordr) 20130915 2014Apr
During visual fixation, the eyes are never completely still, but produce small involuntary movements, called "fixational eye movements," including microsaccades, drift, and tremor. In certain neurological disorders, attempted fixation results in abnormal fixational eye movements with distinctive characteristics. Thus, determining how normal fixation differs from pathological fixation has the potential to aid early and differential noninvasive diagnosis of neurological disease as well as the quantification of its progression and response to treatment. Here, we recorded the eye movements produced by patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and healthy age-matched individuals during attempted fixation. We found that microsaccade magnitudes, velocities, durations, and intersaccadic intervals were comparable in the three subject groups, but microsaccade direction differed in patients versus healthy subjects. Our results indicate that microsaccades are more prevalently oblique in patients with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment than in healthy subjects. These findings extended to those microsaccades paired in square-wave jerks, supporting the hypothesis that microsaccades and square-wave jerks form a continuum, both in healthy subjects and in neurological patients.  
24462566	Polymorphisms in BACE2 may affect the age of onset Alzheimer's dementia in Down syndrome.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131227 2014Jun
It is known that Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents at an early age in people with Down syndrome (DS). The trisomy 21 in DS provides an opportunity to study the effect of duplicated genes in AD. APP and BACE2 are 2 genes located in chromosome 21 and related to AD. We looked into our cohort of 67 DS cases with dementia for the effect of BACE2 variants in age of onset of dementia. Of the 83 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 6 were associated with age of onset and another 8 SNPs were borderline associated. Our finding also replicated a previous study showing association of rs2252576 with AD.  
24628925	Genomic convergence and network analysis approach to identify candidate genes in Alzheimer's disease.
BMC Genomics 20140315 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading genetically complex and heterogeneous disorder that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying risk factors remain largely unclear for this heterogeneous disorder. In recent years, high throughput methodologies, such as genome-wide linkage analysis (GWL), genome-wide association (GWA) studies, and genome-wide expression profiling (GWE), have led to the identification of several candidate genes associated with AD. However, due to lack of consistency within their findings, an integrative approach is warranted. Here, we have designed a rank based gene prioritization approach involving convergent analysis of multi-dimensional data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network modelling. Our approach employs integration of three different AD datasets- GWL,GWA and GWE to identify overlapping candidate genes ranked using a novel cumulative rank score (SR) based method followed by prioritization using clusters derived from PPI network. SR for each gene is calculated by addition of rank assigned to individual gene based on either p value or score in three datasets. This analysis yielded 108 plausible AD genes. Network modelling by creating PPI using proteins encoded by these genes and their direct interactors resulted in a layered network of 640 proteins. Clustering of these proteins further helped us in identifying 6 significant clusters with 7 proteins (EGFR, ACTB, CDC2, IRAK1, APOE, ABCA1 and AMPH) forming the central hub nodes. Functional annotation of 108 genes revealed their role in several biological activities such as neurogenesis, regulation of MAP kinase activity, response to calcium ion, endocytosis paralleling the AD specific attributes. Finally, 3 potential biochemical biomarkers were found from the overlap of 108Â AD proteins with proteins from CSF and plasma proteome. EGFR and ACTB were found to be the two most significant AD risk genes. With the assumption that common genetic signals obtained from different methodological platforms might serve as robust AD risk markers than candidates identified using single dimension approach, here we demonstrated an integrated genomic convergence approach for disease candidate gene prioritization from heterogeneous data sources linked to AD. 
24734229	Role of methylglyoxal in Alzheimer's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140309 2014
Alzheimer's disease is the most common and lethal neurodegenerative disorder. The major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are extracellular aggregation of amyloid Î² peptides and, the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed by precipitation/aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The etiology of Alzheimer's disease is multifactorial and a full understanding of its pathogenesis remains elusive. Some years ago, it has been suggested that glycation may contribute to both extensive protein cross-linking and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease. Glycation is an endogenous process that leads to the production of a class of compounds known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Interestingly, increased levels of AGEs have been observed in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Methylglyoxal, a reactive intermediate of cellular metabolism, is the most potent precursor of AGEs and is strictly correlated with an increase of oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease. Many studies are showing that methylglyoxal and methylglyoxal-derived AGEs play a key role in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.  
24599958	Curcumin alters the salt bridge-containing turn region in amyloid Î²(1-42) aggregates.

Amyloid Î² (AÎ²) fibrillar deposits in the brain are a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Curcumin, a common ingredient of Asian spices, is known to disrupt AÎ² fibril formation and to reduce AD pathology in mouse models. Understanding the structural changes induced by curcumin can potentially lead to AD pharmaceutical agents with inherent bio-compatibility. Here, we use solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structural modifications of amyloid Î²(1-42) (AÎ²42) aggregates induced by curcumin. We find that curcumin induces major structural changes in the Asp-23-Lys-28 salt bridge region and near the C terminus. Electron microscopy shows that the AÎ²42 fibrils are disrupted by curcumin. Surprisingly, some of these alterations are similar to those reported for Zn(2+) ions, another agent known to disrupt the fibrils and alter AÎ²42 toxicity. Our results suggest the existence of a structurally related family of quasi-fibrillar conformers of AÎ²42, which is stabilized both by curcumin and by Zn(2+.)  
24599963	Retinoic acid isomers facilitate apolipoprotein E production and lipidation in astrocytes through the retinoid X receptor/retinoic acid receptor pathway.
J. Biol. Chem. 20140305 2014Apr18
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the major cholesterol transport protein in the brain. Among the three human APOE alleles (APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4), APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The accumulation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) is a central event in AD pathogenesis. Increasing evidence demonstrates that apoE isoforms differentially regulate AD-related pathways through both AÎ²-dependent and -independent mechanisms; therefore, modulating apoE secretion, lipidation, and function might be an attractive approach for AD therapy. We performed a drug screen for compounds that modulate apoE production in immortalized astrocytes derived from apoE3-targeted replacement mice. Here, we report that retinoic acid (RA) isomers, including all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, and 13-cis-RA, significantly increase apoE secretion to ~4-fold of control through retinoid X receptor (RXR) and RA receptor. These effects on modulating apoE are comparable with the effects recently reported for the RXR agonist bexarotene. Furthermore, all of these compounds increased the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 and ABCG1 levels and decreased cellular uptake of AÎ² in an apoE-dependent manner. Both bexarotene and 9-cis-RA promote the lipidation status of apoE, in which 9-cis-RA promotes a stronger effect and exhibits less cytotoxicity compared with bexarotene. Importantly, we showed that oral administration of bexarotene and 9-cis-RA significantly increases apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1 levels in mouse brains. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RXR/RA receptor agonists, including several RA isomers, are effective modulators of apoE secretion and lipidation and may be explored as potential drugs for AD therapy. 
24345162	Reduction in DHA transport to the brain of mice expressing human APOE4 compared to APOE2.
J. Neurochem. 20140129 2014May
Benefits on cognition from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n-3) intake are absent in humans carrying apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele (APOE4), the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To test the hypothesis that carrying APOE4 impairs DHA distribution, we evaluated plasma and brain fatty acid profiles and uptake of [(14) C]-DHA using in situ cerebral perfusion through the blood-brain barrier in 4- and 13-month-old male and female APOE-targeted replacement mice (APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4), fed with a DHA-depleted diet. Cortical and plasma DHA were 9% lower and 34% higher in APOE4 compared to APOE2 mice, respectively. Brain uptake of [(14) C]-DHA was 24% lower in APOE4 versus APOE2 mice. A significant relationship was established between DHA and apoE concentrations in the cortex of mice (r(2) = 0.21) and AD patients (r(2) = 0.32). Altogether, our results suggest that lower brain uptake of DHA in APOE4 than in APOE2 mice may limit the accumulation of DHA in cerebral tissues. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the lack of benefit of DHA in APOE4 carriers on cognitive function and the risk of AD. Using human APOE2, 3, and 4 isoform-specific transgenic mice, we found a lower brain uptake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in APOE4 than in APOE2 mice that may limit the biodistribution of DHA in cerebral tissues. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the lack of benefit of DHA in APOE4 carriers on cognitive function and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
24673497	Efficacy and safety of memantine in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease: results of a pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in Japan.
Expert Opin Pharmacother 20140327 2014May
With the increase in the aging population, there is a pressing need to provide effective treatment options for individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist used to treat AD in &gt; 80 countries worldwide, and studies in the USA and Europe have shown it to be effective in improving language deficits; however, there are currently no data on language improvements in Japanese patients treated with memantine. To clarify the efficacy and safety of memantine in Japanese outpatients with moderate to severe AD, using a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trials, a phase 2 dose-finding study and a phase 3 study. The final analysis comprised 633 patients (318 receiving memantine and 315 placebo). Memantine produced better outcomes in terms of Severe Impairment Battery-Japanese version, Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus-Japanese version, Behavioral Pathology in AD Rating Scale, and language scores, versus placebo. The overall incidence of adverse events and adverse reactions was similar between groups. In this pooled analysis of Japanese patients, memantine achieved better outcomes than placebo in terms of cognition, including attention, praxis, visuospatial ability and language, and behavioral and psychological symptoms, including activity disturbances and aggressiveness. 
24339103	The psychological impact of a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
Dementia (London) 20130805 2014May
Research on the experience of receiving and living with a diagnosis of dementia is sparse. Existing studies have focused on the initial reactions to the diagnosis rather than longer term adjustment and coping. The current study uses interpretative phenomenological analysis to explore personal experiences of receiving a diagnosis and to investigate aspects of the experience of adjusting and adapting to dementia. This is a cross-sectional study drawing on semi-structured interviews with 10 participants who had a diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's disease. The findings illustrated the importance, to people with Alzheimer's disease, of understanding and making sense of the diagnosis to help them deal with issues of loss and to make positive adjustments to their lives through employing specific coping strategies. The findings also appeared to challenge misconceptions held by some professionals in relation to possible negative effects of disclosing a diagnosis of dementia.  
23850329	Mitochondrial DNA deletions in Alzheimer's brains: a review.
Alzheimers Dement 20130711 2014May
Mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress have been associated with normal aging and are possibly implicated in the etiology of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). DNA deletions, as well as other alterations, can result from oxidative damage to nucleic acids. Many studies during the past two decades have investigated the incidence of mitochondrial DNA deletions in postmortem brain tissues of late-onset AD patients compared with age-matched normal control subjects. Published studies are not entirely concordant, but their differences might shed light on the heterogeneity of AD itself. Our understanding of the role that mitochondrial DNA deletions play in disease progression may provide valuable information that could someday lead to a treatment. 
24726809	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of benzylisoquinoline derivatives as multifunctional agents against Alzheimer's disease.
Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 20140403 2014May15
A novel series of benzylisoquinoline derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional agents against Alzheimer's disease (AD). The screening results showed that most of the compounds significantly inhibited cholinesterases (ChEs), human cholinesterases (h-ChEs) and self-induced Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) aggregation. In particular, compound 9k showed the strongest acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, being 1000-fold and 3-fold more potent than its precursor benzylisoquinoline (10) and the positive control galanthamine, respectively. In addition, 9k was a moderately potent inhibitor for h-ChEs. Compared with precursor benzylisoquinoline (36.0% at 20Î¼Ðœ), 9k (78.4% at 20Î¼Ðœ) could further inhibit AÎ² aggregation. Moreover, 9k showed low cell toxicity in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Therefore, compound 9k might be a promising lead compound for AD treatment.  
24615466	The effect of amyloid pathology and glucose metabolism on cortical volume loss over time in Alzheimer's disease.
Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 20140311 2014Jun
The present multimodal neuroimaging study examined whether amyloid pathology and glucose metabolism are related to cortical volume loss over time in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy elderly controls. Structural MRI scans of eleven AD patients and ten controls were available at baseline and follow-up (mean interval 2.5 years). Change in brain structure over time was defined as percent change of cortical volume within seven a-priori defined regions that typically show the strongest structural loss in AD. In addition, two PET scans were performed at baseline: [(11)C]PIB to assess amyloid-Î² plaque load and [(18)F]FDG to assess glucose metabolism. [(11)C]PIB binding and [(18)F]FDG uptake were measured in the precuneus, a region in which both amyloid deposition and glucose hypometabolism occur early in the course of AD. While amyloid-Î² plaque load at baseline was not related to cortical volume loss over time in either group, glucose metabolism within the group of AD patients was significantly related to volume loss over time (rhoâ€‰=â€‰0.56, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05). The present study shows that in a group of AD patients amyloid-Î² plaque load as measured by [(11)C]PIB behaves as a trait marker (i.e., all AD patients showed elevated levels of amyloid, not related to subsequent disease course), whilst hypometabolism as measured by [(18)F]FDG changed over time indicating that it could serve as a state marker that is predictive of neurodegeneration. 
24788773	Effects of oxidative stress on the solubility of HRD1, a ubiquitin ligase implicated in Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140501 2014
The E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of brain neurons and is involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. We previously demonstrated that suppression of HRD1 expression in neurons causes accumulation of amyloid precursor protein, resulting in amyloid Î² production associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, HRD1 levels are significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of Alzheimer's disease patients because of its insolubility. The mechanisms that affect HRD1 solubility are not well understood. We here show that HRD1 protein was insolubilized by oxidative stress but not by other Alzheimer's disease-related molecules and stressors, such as amyloid Î², tau, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, we raise the possibility that modifications of HRD1 by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, an oxidative stress marker, decrease HRD1 protein solubility and the oxidative stress led to the accumulation of HRD1 into the aggresome. Thus, oxidative stress-induced HRD1 insolubilization might be involved in a vicious cycle of increased amyloid Î² production and amyloid Î²-induced oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.  
24598588	Longitudinal change in CSF biomarkers in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.
Sci Transl Med  2014Mar5
Clinicopathological evidence suggests that the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins many years before the appearance of cognitive symptoms. Biomarkers are required to identify affected individuals during this asymptomatic ("preclinical") stage to permit intervention with potential disease-modifying therapies designed to preserve normal brain function. Studies of families with autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) mutations provide a unique and powerful means to investigate AD biomarker changes during the asymptomatic period. In this biomarker study, we collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and in vivo amyloid imaging cross-sectional data at baseline in individuals from ADAD families enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. Our study revealed reduced concentrations of CSF amyloid-Î²1-42 (AÎ²1-42) associated with the presence of AÎ² plaques, and elevated concentrations of CSF tau, ptau181 (phosphorylated tau181), and VILIP-1 (visinin-like protein-1), markers of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal injury/death, in asymptomatic mutation carriers 10 to 20 years before their estimated age at symptom onset (EAO) and before the detection of cognitive deficits. When compared longitudinally, however, the concentrations of CSF biomarkers of neuronal injury/death within individuals decreased after their EAO, suggesting a slowing of acute neurodegenerative processes with symptomatic disease progression. These results emphasize the importance of longitudinal, within-person assessment when modeling biomarker trajectories across the course of the disease. If corroborated, this pattern may influence the definition of a positive neurodegenerative biomarker outcome in clinical trials.

24237038	The association between biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and structural changes in the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Intern. Med. 20131211 2014Apr
Biochemical changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could reflect pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is still not clear how these processes correlate with grey matter (GM) volume and microstructural changes in the brain. To assess the relationship between CSF biomarkers and structural brain changes in AD. Cross-sectional study in a memory clinic-based sample. A total of 78 subjects were included in the study: 22 with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), 35 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 21 with AD. Voxel-wise correlations between CSF biomarkers, including Î²-amyloid42 (AÎ²42), tau phosphorylated at position threonine 181 and total tau protein, and GM volume, self-diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistical analyses. FA and MD maps were obtained using diffusion tensor imaging. In the whole sample (patients with SCI, MCI and AD), there was positive correlation between GM volume and AÎ²42 concentration, and negative correlation with total tau protein. Higher FA was only related to higher concentration of AÎ²42. MD showed significant negative correlation with AÎ²42 and positive correlation with T-tau levels. The majority of brain regions with significant correlation with CSF biomarkers overlapped with the default mode network and extended to the adjacent white matter. Early AD pathological changes can be detected with voxel-based morphometric analysis and diffusion tensor imaging measurements. Furthermore, there was an association between CSF AD biomarkers and structural brain changes in areas related to the default mode network. 
24410954	Transfer of omega-3 fatty acids across the blood-brain barrier after dietary supplementation with a docosahexaenoic acid-rich omega-3 fatty acid preparation in patients with Alzheimer's disease: the OmegAD study.
J. Intern. Med. 20140111 2014Apr
Little is known about the transfer of essential fatty acids (FAs) across the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) in adulthood. In this study, we investigated whether oral supplementation with omega-3 (n-3) FAs would change the FA profile of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 33 patients (18 receiving the n-3 FA supplement and 15 receiving placebo) were included in the study. These patients were participants in the double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized OmegAD study in which 204 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) received 2.3 g n-3 FA [high in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] or placebo daily for 6 months. CSF FA levels were related to changes in plasma FA and to CSF biomarkers of AD and inflammation. At 6 months, the n-3 FA supplement group displayed significant increases in CSF (and plasma) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), DHA and total n-3 FA levels (P &lt; 0.01), whereas no changes were observed in the placebo group. Changes in CSF and plasma levels of EPA and n-3 docosapentaenoic acid were strongly correlated, in contrast to those of DHA. Changes in DHA levels in CSF were inversely correlated with CSF levels of total and phosphorylated tau, and directly correlated with soluble interleukin-1 receptor type II. Thus, the more DHA increased in CSF, the greater the change in CSF AD/inflammatory biomarkers. Oral supplementation with n-3 FAs conferred changes in the n-3 FA profile in CSF, suggesting transfer of these FAs across the BBB in adults. 
24670540	[Aspects of quality of life of residents of a nursing oasis from the perspectives of relatives and nurses- qualitative results of an evaluation study].
Pflege  2014Apr
A nursing oasis (NO) can be understood as a version of special care units. The focus is on a constantly living arrangement for people with severe dementia in nursing homes (multiple person room). Nurses are permanently present during the day shift. The question has to be raised which characteristics of quality of life (QoL) are mentioned and how nurses and relatives do assess this concept. Qualitative Results of a two-year evaluation study of 15 people living in NOs are presented. Data were collected during four (five) group discussions with 8 nurses (15 relatives). Additionally problem-based interviews were realized. Data evaluation was oriented to the grounded theory. The findings show that primarily the focus of QoL in NOs was on psychophysical well-being. Assessments of relatives and nurses were prevailing positive and could be interpreted in the light of the Festingers' social-psychological "Theory of Cognitive Dissonance". Comparisons between the situation before and after the implementation of the NOs were shown to be relevant for the overall assessments. All in all we have to deal with the construction of "care worlds of everyday life" in long term care institutions.  
23948264	Pathological roles of ceramide and its metabolites in metabolic syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20130813 2014May
The public health burden of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a multiplex risk factor that arises from insulin resistance accompanying abnormal adipose conditions, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, continues to expand. Current available therapies for these disorders are of limited effectiveness. Recent findings have indicated that alternations in sphingolipid metabolism contribute to the development of these pathologies. Sphingolipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane, where they are known to form several types of microdomains, and are potent regulators for a variety of physiological processes. Many groups, including ours, have demonstrated that membrane sphingolipids, especially ceramide and its metabolites such as ceramide 1-phosphate, have roles in arteriosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, and inflammation associated with MetS. Aberrant sphingolipid profiles have been observed in human AD brains, and accumulated evidence has demonstrated that changes in membrane properties induced by defective sphingolipid metabolism impair generation and degradation of amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²), a pathogenic agent of AD. In this review, we summarize current knowledge and pathophysiological implications of the roles of SLs in MetS and AD, to provide insight into the SL metabolic pathways as potential targets for therapy of these diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled New Frontiers in Sphingolipid Biology.  
23650246	Longitudinal relationship of low leisure satisfaction but not depressive symptoms with systemic low-grade inflammation in dementia caregivers.
J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci 20130506 2014May
This study aimed to further elucidate the biobehavioral mechanisms linking dementia caregiving with an increased cardiovascular disease risk. We hypothesized that both elevated depressive symptoms and a behavioral correlate of depression, low leisure satisfaction, are associated with systemic inflammation. We studied 121 elderly Alzheimer's disease caregivers who underwent 4 annual assessments for depressive symptoms, leisure satisfaction, and circulating levels of inflammatory markers. We used mixed-regression analyses controlling for sociodemographic and health-relevant covariates to examine longitudinal relationships between constructs of interest. There were inverse relationships between total leisure satisfaction and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±; p = .047), interleukin-8 (IL-8; p &lt; .001), and interferon-Î³ (IFG; p = .020) but not with IL-6 (p = .21) and C-reactive protein (p = .65). Lower enjoyment from leisure activities was related to higher levels of TNF-Î± (p = .045), IL-8 (p &lt; .001), and IFG (p = .002), whereas lower frequency of leisure activities was related only to higher IL-8 levels (p = .023). Depressive symptoms were not associated with any inflammatory marker (all p values &gt; .17). Depressive symptoms did not mediate the relationship between leisure satisfaction and inflammation. Lower satisfaction with leisure activities is related to higher low-grade systemic inflammation. This knowledge may provide a promising way of improving cardiovascular health in dementia caregivers through behavioral activation treatments targeting low leisure satisfaction. 
24635004	Montreal Cognitive Assessment Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) as a predictor of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.
J Am Geriatr Soc 20140317 2014Apr
To assess the usefulness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score (MoCA-TS) and Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) in predicting conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Retrospective chart review. Community-based memory clinic. Individuals meeting Petersen's MCI criteria (N = 165). Baseline MoCA scores at MCI diagnosis were collected from charts of eligible individuals with MCI, and MoCA-TS, MoCA-MIS, and a cognitive domain index score were calculated to assess their prognostic value in predicting conversion to AD. One hundred fourteen participants progressed to AD (MCI-AD), and 51 did not (nonconverters; MCI-NC); 90.5% of participants with MCI with a MoCA-TS less than 20/30 and a MoCA-MIS less than 7/15 at baseline converted to AD within the average follow-up period of 18 months, compared with 52.7% of participants with MCI above the cutoffs on both scores. Individuals with multiple-domain amnestic MCI had the highest AD conversion rates (73.9%). Identifying individuals with MCI at high risk of conversion to AD is important clinically and for selecting appropriate subjects for therapeutic trials. Individuals with MCI with a low MoCA-TS and a low newly devised memory index score (MoCA-MIS) are at greater risk of short-term conversion to AD. 
24157706	Cost analysis of early psychosocial intervention in Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131019 2014
To investigate the impact of early psychosocial intervention aimed at patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers on resource use and costs from a societal perspective. Dyads of patients and their primary caregiver were randomised to intervention (n = 163) or control (n = 167) and followed for 3 years. Health care use was extracted from national registers, and the Resource Utilisation in Dementia questionnaire was used to measure informal care and productivity loss. Multiple imputation was used to replace missing data, and non-parametric bootstrapping was used to estimate standard errors. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences because of large variation in the observations. The average additional cost of psychosocial intervention provision was estimated at EUR 3,401 per patient. This cost masked a reduced use of formal health care and an increased use of informal care. Early psychosocial intervention in AD could be cost-saving from a health care perspective, whereas the opposite seems to be true from a broader societal perspective. 
24157938	High tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid predict rapid decline and increased dementia mortality in Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131024 2014
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid Î²42 (AÎ²42), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are useful as predictors of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, results are contradictory as to whether these biomarkers reflect the future rate of clinical decline. This is a retrospective study on 196 patients with AD [mild/moderate AD (n = 72) or AD-MCI (n = 124) at baseline] with a follow-up period of 2-9 years' duration (median 6 years). Lumbar punctures were performed at baseline as a part of the diagnostic procedure. We found an increased risk of rapid cognitive decline defined as a drop in the Mini-Mental State Examination score of â‰¥ 4 points/year in patients with CSF t-tau concentrations above the median (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.53-7.16) and CSF p-tau above the median (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.21-5.26). Patients with CSF t-tau in the highest quartile had a higher risk of dying in severe dementia (HR 4.67, 95% CI 1.16-18.82). In this large AD cohort, we found an association between high levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau and a more aggressive course of the disease, measured as a rapid cognitive decline and a higher risk of dying in severe dementia. 
24193095	Application of the PredictAD decision support tool to a Danish cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131026 2014
The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on an ever-increasing body of data and knowledge making it a complex task. The PredictAD tool integrates heterogeneous patient data using an interactive user interface to provide decision support. The aim of this project was to investigate the performance of the tool in distinguishing AD from non-AD dementia using a realistic clinical dataset. We retrieved clinical data from a group of patients diagnosed with AD (n = 72), vascular dementia (VaD, n = 30), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 25) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 14) at the Copenhagen Memory Clinic at Rigshospitalet. Three classification methods were applied to the data in order to differentiate between AD and a group of non-AD dementias. The methods were the PredictAD tool's Disease State Index (DSI), the naÃ¯ve Bayesian classifier and the random forest. The DSI performed best for this realistic dataset with an accuracy of 76.6% compared to the accuracies for the naÃ¯ve Bayesian classifier and random forest of 67.4 and 66.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the DSI differentiated between the four diagnostic groups with a p value of &lt;0.0001. In this dataset, the DSI method used by the PredictAD tool showed a superior performance for the differentiation between patients with AD and those with other dementias. However, the methods need to be refined further in order to optimize the differential diagnosis between AD, FTD, VaD and DLB. 
24193144	Corpus callosum atrophy and cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's disease: longitudinal MRI study.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131026 2014
We investigated the rate of corpus callosum (CC) atrophy and its association with cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used publicly available longitudinal MRI data corresponding to 2 or more visits from 137 subjects characterized using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score. We classified these subjects into 3 groups according to the progression of their cognitive status: a healthy control group (CDR 0â†’0, n = 72), a decliner group (CDR 0â†’0.5, n = 14) and an AD group (CDR 0.5â†’0.5/1, n = 51). We measured the CC area on the midsagittal plane and calculated the atrophy rate between 2 or more visits. The correlation between the CC atrophy rate and annualized Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) change was also analyzed. The results indicated that the baseline CC area was larger in the healthy control group compared to the AD group, whereas the CC atrophy rate was higher in the AD group relative to the control and decliner groups. The CC atrophy rate was also correlated with the annualized MMSE change in AD patients (p &lt; 0.05). Callosal atrophy is present even in early AD and subsequently accelerates, such that the rate of CC atrophy is associated with cognitive decline in AD patients. 
24193223	Validation of the Chinese version of Addenbrooke's cognitive examination-revised for screening mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131102 2014
As a suitable test to screen for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), studies to validate the Chinese version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) are rare. A total of 151 subjects were recruited and the neuropsychological assessments were employed. One-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni correction were used to compare scores of different psychometric scales. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's coefficient Î± were used to evaluate the reliability of psychometric scales. The validity of ACE-R to screen for mild AD and amnestic subtype of MCI (a-MCI) was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The Chinese ACE-R had good reliability (inter-rater ICC = 0.994; test-retest ICC = 0.967) as well as reliable internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient Î± = 0.859). With its cutoff of 67/68, the sensitivity (0.920) and specificity (0.857) were lower than for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cutoff (sensitivity 1.000 and specificity 0.937) to screen for mild AD. However, the sensitivity of ACE-R to screen for a-MCI was superior to the MMSE with a cutoff of 85/86. The specificity of ACE-R was lower than that of the MMSE to screen for a-MCI. The area under the ROC curve of ACE-R was much larger than that of the MMSE (0.836 and 0.751) for detecting a-MCI rather than mild AD. The Chinese ACE-R is a reliable assessment tool for cognitive impairment. It is more sensitive and accurate in screening for a-MCI rather than for AD compared to the MMSE. 
24247022	Phase II crossover trial of varenicline in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131114 2014
Evidence supports a role of Î±4Î²2 receptors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This Korean, multicenter, double-blind, two-period (6 weeks each), crossover study randomized participants to the order in which they received varenicline (1 mg twice daily) and placebo. Assessments included AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) 75, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), adverse events (AEs) and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). For varenicline versus placebo (n = 66 randomized), there was no significant difference in the week 6 least square (LS) mean ADAS-Cog 75 total score (primary endpoint; 18.07 vs. 18.49; p = 0.3873) and a slight worsening in the week 6 LS mean NPI (3.82 vs. 2.55; p = 0.0468), primarily driven by decreased appetite/eating. Common treatment-related AEs were nausea (23.3; 3.4%), vomiting (15.0%; 0) and decreased appetite (15.0; 6.8%). Varenicline did not improve cognition, behavior or global change in this population. The most frequent varenicline-associated AEs were gastrointestinal; psychiatric AEs were rare and similar between the groups.

Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidence shows that antioxidant-rich food reduces the risk of AD by inhibiting oxidative stress. This study investigates whether serum levels of carotenoids were associated with the risk of AD mortality in a nationally representative sample of US adults. We used data from the Third Nutrition and Health Examination Survey (NHANES III) database and the NHANES III Linked Mortality File. A total of 6,958 participants aged older than 50 years were included in this study. We found that high serum levels of lycopene and lutein+zeaxanthin at baseline were associated with a lower risk of AD mortality after adjustment for potential covariates. The reduction in the mortality risk was progressively raised by increasing serum lycopene (HR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.69) and lutein+zeaxanthin (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.85) levels. In contrast, no associations with AD mortality were observed for other serum carotenoids, including alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin. High serum levels of lycopene and lutein+zeaxanthin are associated with a lower risk of AD mortality in adults. Our findings suggest that a high intake of lycopene- or lutein+zeaxanthin-rich food may be important for reducing the AD mortality risk. 
24565289	APOE Îµ4 and the risk for Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline in African Americans and Yoruba.
Int Psychogeriatr 20140224 2014Jun
There is little information on the association of the APOEe4 allele and AD risk in African populations. In previous analyses from the Indianapolis-Ibadan dementia project, we have reported that APOE Îµ4 increased the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in African Americans but not in Yoruba. This study represents a replication of this earlier work using enriched cohorts and extending the analysis to include cognitive decline. In this longitudinal study of two community dwelling cohorts of elderly Yoruba and African Americans, APOE genotyping was conducted from blood samples taken on or before 2001 (1,871 African Americans &amp; 2,200 Yoruba). Mean follow up time was 8.5 years for African Americans and 8.8 years for Yoruba. The effects of heterozygosity or homozygosity of Îµ4 and of the possession of e4 on time to incident AD and on cognitive decline were determined using Cox's proportional hazards regression and mixed effects models. After adjusting for covariates, one or two copies of the APOE Îµ4 allele were significant risk factors for incident AD (p &lt; 0.0001) and cognitive decline in the African-American population (p &lt; 0001). In the Yoruba, only homozygosity for APOE Îµ4 was a significant risk factor for AD (p = 0.0002) but not for cognitive decline (p = 0.2346), however, possession of an e4 allele was significant for both incident AD (p = 0.0489) and cognitive decline (p = 0.0425). In this large longitudinal comparative study, APOE Îµ4 had a significant, but weaker, effect on incident AD and on cognitive decline in Yoruba than in African Americans. The reasons for these differences remain unclear. 
24022074	Effect of proinflammatory gene polymorphisms on the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurodegener Dis 20130906 2014
A number of studies associate Alzheimer's disease (AD) with APOE polymorphism and alleles which favor the increased expression of immunological mediators such as cytokines or acute-phase proteins. In this study we evaluated the distribution of a set of functionally important polymorphisms of genes encoding prototypical inflammatory molecules in individuals with AD. We also investigated whether a synergistic effect of these proinflammatory gene polymorphisms on the risk of AD could be hypothesized. In a genetic association study that included 533 AD patients and 713 controls, the following gene polymorphisms were analyzed: C-reactive protein (CRP) 1059 G/C, interleukin 6 (IL6) -174 G/C, interleukin 1Î² (IL1B) -31 T/C, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) -308 G/A, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) -173 G/C, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2) -2518 A/G, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) 469 E/K, E-selectin (SELE) Ser128Arg, macrophage inflammatory protein 1Î± (CCL3) -906 T/A, matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) -1171 5A/6A and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) -1562 C/T. We found that IL6, IL1B, CCL2, CCL3, SELE, ICAM1, MMP3, and MMP9 gene polymorphisms were significantly and independently associated with AD. The association remained significant even after the Bonferroni correction. We also found that these proinflammatory polymorphisms were associated with different levels of risk for AD, depending on the number of high-risk genotypes concomitantly carried by a given individual. Proinflammatory genotypes might influence the development and progression of AD exerting a potential synergistic effect. 
24080522	Synthesis of methoxy-X04 derivatives and their evaluation in Alzheimer's disease pathology.
Neurodegener Dis 20130925 2014
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two notorious protein aggregates in the brain: extracellular senile plaques mainly consisting of amyloid-Î² peptides and tau-protein-derived intracellular paired helical filaments. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is impaired by insufficient sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic methods to visualize these pathological hallmarks over all disease stages. The established fluorescence marker methoxy-X04 stains plaques, tau tangles and amyloid-derived angiopathies with good specificity, yet it is limited by slow elimination in vivo. Since the need for new markers is high, we prepared methoxy-X04 derivatives and evaluated their potential as imaging agents in Alzheimer's disease pathology. In this study, we describe an improved synthesis for methoxy-X04 and its derivatives and their affinity determination for the respective protein targets by immunohistology and a displacement assay. This resulted in the identification of new derivatives of methoxy-X04 with improved binding affinity. 
23706516	The Îµ4 genotype of apolipoprotein E and white matter integrity in Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130521 2014May
In this multicenter study, we investigated a possible association between the APOE Îµ4 allele and white matter (WM) integrity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We analyzed fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) as indices of WM integrity in 70 AD patients (35 APOE Îµ4 carriers, 35 noncarriers) and 56 healthy control (HC) subjects (28 APOE Îµ4 carriers, 28 noncarriers). APOE Îµ4 carriers and noncarriers were matched for age and gender within each diagnostic group. We found significant effects of diagnosis (Pcorrected &lt; .05 [FWE]; i.e., smaller FA values and larger MD values in AD patients compared with HCs) and significant effects (P &lt; .001) of APOE Îµ4 carrier status on MD in HCs but not in AD subjects. The results indicate that APOE Îµ4 has a moderate effect on WM integrity in HCs, but no effect on WM integrity in manifest AD. 
23712001	Effect of APOE genotype status on targeted clinical trials outcomes and efficiency in dementia and mild cognitive impairment resulting from Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130525 2014May
The apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 genotype has been recommended as a potential inclusion or exclusion criterion in targeted clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) resulting from AD, and has been implemented in trials of immunotherapeutic agents. We tested this recommendation with clinical trial simulations using participants from a meta-database of 19 studies to create trial samples with APOE Îµ4 proportions ranging from 0% (all noncarriers) to 100% (all carriers). For each percentage of APOE Îµ4 carriers, we resampled the database randomly for 1000 trials for each trial scenario, planning for 18- or 24-month trials with samples from 50 to 400 patients per treatment or placebo group, up to 40% dropouts, and outcomes on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) with effect sizes from 0.15 to 0.75, and calculated statistical power. Enrichment of clinical trial participants based on APOE Îµ4 carrier status resulted in minimal increases in power compared with enrolling participants with the APOE Îµ3 genotype only or enrolling patients without regard to APOE genotype. Increased screening requirements to enhance the sample would offset gains in power. Although samples enriched for APOE Îµ4 carriers in AD or MCI clinical trials showed slightly more cognitive impairment and greater decline using the number APOE Îµ4 alleles as an inclusion criterion most likely would not result in more efficient trials, and trials would take longer because fewer patients would be available. The APOE Îµ4/ÎµX (where X = 2, 3 or 4) genotype could be useful, however, as an explanatory variable or covariate if warranted by a drug's action. 
23727081	Variants in PPP3R1 and MAPT are associated with more rapid functional decline in Alzheimer's disease: the Cache County Dementia Progression Study.
Alzheimers Dement 20130530 2014May
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the gene encoding the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2B (PPP3R1, rs1868402) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, rs3785883) gene were recently associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels in samples from the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University (WU) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In these same samples, these SNPs were also associated with faster functional decline, or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted to validate the latter association in an independent, population-based sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study (DPS). All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb â‰¤1 (mild) at initial clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb data on at least two other time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of interest (rs1868402 and rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between these SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS. Although we observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 alone and change in CDR-sb (P &gt; .10), there was a significant association between a combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed &gt;2.9 times faster than noncarriers (P = .015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data from WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30% faster for each copy of the high-risk allele at rs3785883 (P = .0082) and carriers of both high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed 6 times faster (P &lt; .0001) than all others combined. We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et al that specific variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with accelerated progression of AD. Further characterization of this association will provide a better understanding of how genetic factors influence the rate of progression of AD and could provide novel insights into preventative and therapeutic strategies. 
23849592	Validity of dementia and Alzheimer's disease diagnoses in Finnish national registers.
Alzheimers Dement 20130710 2014May
We investigated dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) diagnoses in three national registers in Finland: the Hospital Discharge Register (HDR), the Drug Reimbursement Register, and the Causes of Death Register (CDR). The Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) study was used as the gold standard. Participants were first evaluated in 1972 to 1987, and were reexamined in 1998 and in 2005 to 2008. Two approaches were used for the HDR: with a time restriction (considering "positive" only those cases recorded in the HDR before CAIDE study evaluations) and without a time restriction. Sensitivity of the HDR was 13.7% with time restriction and 51% without time restriction (dementia), and 15.6% with time restriction 55.6% without time restriction (AD). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 87.5% with time restriction and 96.3% without time restriction (dementia), and 100% for AD. Sensitivity and PPV of the HDR were greater after 1998. For AD in the Drug Reimbursement Register alone, sensitivity was 63.5% and PPV was 97.1%; together with the HDR, sensitivity became 65.4% with time restriction and 71.1% without time restriction, and PPV was 100%. For dementia in the CDR, sensitivity was 62.2% and PPV was 100%. Diagnoses in registers have very good accuracy, but underestimation of dementia/AD occurrence may cause an underestimation of associations with risk/protective factors. 
23850330	CSF AÎ²1-42 combined with neuroimaging biomarkers in the early detection, diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130711 2014May
The development of validated, qualified, and standardized biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that allow for an early presymptomatic diagnosis and discrimination (classification) from other types of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases is warranted to accelerate the successful development of novel disease-modifying therapies. Here, we focus on the value of the 42-residue-long amyloid Î² isoform (AÎ²1-42) peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid as the core, feasible neurobiochemical marker for the amyloidogenic mechanisms in early-onset familial and late-onset sporadic AD. We discuss the role and use of AÎ²1-42 in combination with evolving neuroimaging biomarkers in AD detection and diagnosis. Multimodal neuroimaging techniques, directly providing structural-functional-metabolic aspects of brain pathophysiology, are supportive to predict and monitor the progression of the disease. Advances in multimodal neuroimaging provide new insights into brain organization and enable the detection of specific proteins and/or protein aggregates associated with AD. The combination of biomarkers from different methodologies is believed to be of incrementally added risk-value to accurately identify asymptomatic and prodromal individuals who will likely progress to dementia and represent rational biomarker candidates for preventive and symptomatic pharmacological intervention trials. 
23871764	Reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
Alzheimers Dement 20130718 2014May
Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a risk factor for dementia in several cross-sectional studies. We tested the hypothesis that reduced plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia in the general population. We measured baseline plasma 25(OH)D in 10,186 white individuals from the Danish general population. During 30 years of follow-up, 418 participants developed AD and 92 developed vascular dementia. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for AD were 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.64) for 25(OH)D less than 25 nmol/L vs. greater than or equal to 50 nmol/L, and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.01-1.66) for less than the 25th seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D percentile vs. more than the 50th seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D percentile. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for vascular dementia were 1.22 (95% CI, 0.77-1.91) for 25(OH)D less than 50 nmol/L vs. greater than or equal to 50 nmol/L, and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.79-1.87) for less than or equal to the 50th vs. more than the 50th seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D percentile. Last, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for the combined end point were 1.28 (95% CI, 1.00-1.64) for 25(OH)D less than 25 nmol/L vs. greater than or equal to 50 nmol/L, and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.01-1.60) for less than the 25th vs. more than the 50th seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D. We observed an association of reduced plasma 25(OH)D with increased risk of the combined end point of AD and vascular dementia in this prospective cohort study of the general population. 
23896613	APOE interacts with age to modify rate of decline in cognitive and brain changes in Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130727 2014May
To determine (1) whether age-standardized cognitive declines and brain morphometric change differ between Young-Old patients with Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) and Very-Old patients with Alzheimer's disease (VOAD), and (2) whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modifies these neuropsychological and morphometric changes. Baseline and 12-month follow-up neuropsychological and morphometric measures were examined for healthy control subjects and patients with AD. The two AD groups were divided further into subgroups on the basis of the presence of at least one APOE Îµ4 allele. The YOAD group showed more severe deficits and steeper declines in cognition than the VOAD group. Moreover, the presence of an APOE Îµ4 allele had a more deleterious effect on the YOAD group than the VOAD group on cognition and brain structure both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results underscore the importance of integrating an individual's age and genetic susceptibility--and their interaction--when examining neuropsychological and neuroimaging changes in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. 
23916838	Epitope-based DNA vaccine for Alzheimer's disease: translational study in macaques.
Alzheimers Dement 20130731 2014May
Clinical trials with passive and active Alzheimer's disease (AD) vaccines suggest that early interventions are needed for improvement of cognitive and/or functional performance in patients, providing impetus for the development of safe and immunologically potent active vaccines targeting amyloid Î² (AÎ²). The AN-1792 trial has indicated that AÎ²-specific T cells may be unsafe for humans; therefore, other vaccines based on small AÎ² epitopes are undergoing preclinical and clinical testing. Humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in response to a novel DNA epitope-based vaccine (AV-1955) delivered to rhesus macaques using the TriGrid electroporation device were evaluated. Functional activities of anti-AÎ² antibodies generated in response to vaccination were assessed in vitro. AV-1955 generates long-term, potent anti-AÎ² antibodies and cellular immune responses specific to foreign T-helper epitopes but not to self-AÎ². This translational study demonstrates that a DNA-based epitope vaccine for AD could be appropriate for human clinical testing. 
24035148	Design of a comprehensive Alzheimer's disease clinic and research center in Spain to meet critical patient and family needs.
Alzheimers Dement 20130910 2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects people worldwide, and the prevalence is increasing as the population ages. There is an international effort to understand the biology of AD to develop primary and secondary prevention strategies, and to develop effective therapeutic interventions for individuals who are already symptomatic. One of the critically important pieces of all national plans to address AD is the call for the development of service models to deliver quality, effective care based on the best evidence available. We describe one type of care model developed by the Fundacio ACE, Institut Catala de Neurociencies Aplicades (Fundacio ACE, Barcelona, Spain) that integrates diagnosis, therapy, follow-up care, daycare, and a day hospital, and does so in the context of an active clinical research and educational program. There were 13,048 individuals newly evaluated and diagnosed in Fundacio ACE between 1996 and 2011. Of these, 6132 had AD (47.0%), 3871 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (29.7%), and 1958 had no cognitive impairment (15.0%). Follow-up information is available on 4735 (47.3%) AD and MCI patients, and these data indicate that MCI develops into dementia at a rate of 222.6/1000 person-years. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was available in 22.4% of the patients. The Îµ4 allele occurred in 45.7% of the AD patients, in 37.8% of the MCI subjects, and in 31.6% of those without cognitive impairment. FundaciÃ³ ACE can serve as a model system that can be adapted to other settings within their specific cultural, governmental, and legal constraints. 
24560029	The MultiTEP platform-based Alzheimer's disease epitope vaccine activates a broad repertoire of T helper cells in nonhuman primates.
Alzheimers Dement 20140220 2014May
As a prelude to clinical trials we have characterized B- and T-cell immune responses in macaques to AD vaccine candidates: AV-1955 and its slightly modified version, AV-1959 (with 3 additional promiscuous Th epitopes). T- and B-cell epitope mapping was performed using the ELISPOT assay and competition ELISA, respectively. AV-1955 and AV-1959 did not stimulate potentially harmful autoreactive T cells, but instead activated a broad but individualized repertoire of Th cells specific to the MultiTEP platform in macaques. Although both vaccines induced robust anti-AÎ² antibody responses without producing antibodies specific to Th epitopes of MultiTEP platforms, analyses of cellular immune responses in macaques demonstrated that the addition of Th epitopes in the case of AV-1959 created a more potent, superior vaccine. AV-1959 is a promising vaccine candidate capable of producing therapeutically potent anti-amyloid antibody in a broader population of vaccinated subjects with high MHC class II gene polymorphisms. 
24589433	The amyloid hypothesis, time to move on: Amyloid is the downstream result, not cause, of Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20140228 2014May
The "amyloid hypothesis" has dominated Alzheimer research for more than 20 years, and proposes that amyloid is the toxic cause of neural/synaptic damage and dementia. If correct, decreasing the formation or removing amyloid should be therapeutic. Despite discrepancies in the proposed mechanism, and failed clinical trials, amyloid continues to be considered the cause of a degenerative cascade. Alternative hypotheses must explain three features: (i) why amyloid toxicity is not the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), (ii) what alternative mechanisms cause the degeneration and dementia of AD, and (iii) why increased amyloid accumulates in the brain in AD. We propose that AD, which occurs in elderly, already vulnerable brains, with multiple age-related changes, is precipitated by impaired microvascular function, resulting primarily from decreased Notch-related angiogenesis. With impaired microvasculature, a lack of vascular endothelial-derived trophic factors and decreased cerebral blood flow cause the atrophy of neural structures. Therapeutic strategies should focus on supporting normal angiogenesis. 
24780512	International Alzheimer's Disease Research Portfolio (IADRP) aims to capture global Alzheimer's disease research funding.
Alzheimers Dement  2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a recognized international public health crisis. There is an urgent need for public and private funding agencies around the world to coordinate funding strategies and leverage existing resources to enhance and expand support of AD research. To capture and compare their existing investments in AD research and research-related resources, major funding organizations are starting to utilize the Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) to categorize their funding information. This information is captured in the International Alzheimer's Disease Research Portfolio (IADRP) for further analysis. As of January, 2014, over fifteen organizations from the US, Canada, Europe and Australia have contributed their information. The goal of the IADRP project is to enable funding organizations to assess the changing landscape of AD research and coordinate strategies, leverage resources, and avoid duplication of effort. 
24783344	[Satisfaction with the quality of care in nursing homes--the nurses' perspective].
Pflege Z  2014Mar
In Germany, the number of residents in Nursing Homes (NH) has increased in recent years, residents become older, increasingly multimorbid and suffer more from dementia. In parallel demands concerning the quality of care in NH have increased. The vivid poltical and public debate about quality of care, however, widely disregards the perception of nurses. The aim of this study is to investigate the nurses' satisfaction with the quality of care in their NH and potential psychological consequences. Secondary questionnaire data from 1489 nurses in 88 NH of the German 3Q-study (www.3q-studie.de) were used from the 2011 investigation. Questions regarding satisfaction enquire satsifaction in five nursing work domains. Descriptive analyses as well Chi2-tests were performed. The majority of nurses were satisfied in the subdomain "overall quality of care" and "physical care" (80% each). 67% were satisfied with "the quality of care for residents with dementia" and 64% with "end-of-life care". Only 56% of the nurses were satisfied with "mental care". If nurses were unsatisfied with the quality of care, this was mostly perceived as a psychological stressor. Subgroup analysis showed a pattern for four of the five domains: dissatisfied nurses were older, better qualified, worked more than 25 hours per week and worked in larger NH. No such pattern was found for "quality of care for residents with dementia". Nurses' satisfaction with the quality of care has shown to be a relevant work factor and potential stressor deserving more scientific and clinical attention. For NH it could constitute a core indicator for internal quality management as well as for human resource management. Research in work, health and economy in NH should also consider this factor. 
24876869	Potential retinoid x receptor agonists for treating Alzheimer's disease from traditional chinese medicine.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140430 2014
Alzheimer's disease is neurodegenerative disorder due to the accumulation of amyloid- Î² in the brain and causes dementia with ageing. Some researches indicate that the RXR agonist, Targretin, has also been used for treatment of Alzheimer's disease in mouse models. We investigate the potent candidates as RXR agonists from the vast repertoire of TCM compounds in TCM Database@Taiwan. The potential TCM compounds, Î² -lipoic acid and sulfanilic acid, had higher potent binding affinities than both 9-cis-retinoic acid and Targretin in docking simulation and have stable H-bonds with residues Arg316 and some equivalent hydrophobic contacts with residues Ala272, Gln275, Leu309, Phe313, Val342, Ile345, and Cys432 as Targretin. The carboxyl or sulfonyl hydroxide group can form a H-bond with key residue Arg316 in the docking pose, and the phenyl group next to the carboxyl or sulfonyl hydroxide group can form a Ï€ interaction with residue Phe313. Moreover, Î² -lipoic acid and sulfanilic acid have stable H-bonds with residue Gln275, Ser313, and residue Ala327, respectively, which may strengthen and stabilize TCM candidates inside the binding domain of RXR protein. Hence, we propose Î² -lipoic acid and sulfanilic acid as potential lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the RXR protein against Alzheimer's disease.  
24877042	Treadmill exercise alleviates impairment of spatial learning ability through enhancing cell proliferation in the streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer's disease rats.
J Exerc Rehabil 20140430 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. This disease is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder accompanied with severe learning and memory impairment. Exercise increases cognitive ability, attenuates motor deficits, increases new neuron formation, and ameliorates neurological impairments in several neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigated the effects of treadmill exercise on spatial learning ability in relation with cell proliferation in the hippocampus. The rat model of Alzheimer's disease was induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of streptozotocin (STZ) using a stereotaxic instrument. The rats in the exercise groups were forced to run on a treadmill for once 30 min daily for 28 consecutive days starting at 3 days after the ICV injection of STZ. Radial 8-arm maze test was conducted for the spatial learning ability. New neuron formation in the hippocampus was detected by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) expressions were examined by western blot analysis. The present results show that ICV injection of STZ impaired spatial learning ability. Decreased cell proliferation with decrement of BDNF and TrkB expressions in the hippocampus were observed in the STZ-induced Alzheimer's disease rats. However, treadmill exercise alleviated deficits of spatial learning ability. Treadmill exercise enhanced cell proliferation and increased BDNF and TrkB expressions in the rats with ICV injection of STZ. The present study suggests that treadmill exercise can be a useful strategy for treating memory impairment induced by several neurodegenerative diseases.  
24335535	Neuropathologic heterogeneity does not impair florbetapir-positron emission tomography postmortem correlates.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Jan
Neuropathologic heterogeneity is often present among Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. We sought to determine whether amyloid imaging measures of AD are affected by concurrent pathologies. Thirty-eight clinically and pathologically defined AD and 17 nondemented patients with quantitative florbetapir F-18 (F-AV-45) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging during life and postmortem histological Î²-amyloid quantification and neuropathologic examination were assessed. AD patients were divided on the basis of concurrent pathologies, including those with Lewy bodies (LBs) (n = 21), white matter rarefaction (n = 27), severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 11), argyrophilic grains (n = 5), and TAR DNA binding protein-43 inclusions (n = 18). Many patients exhibited more than 1 type of concurrent pathology. The ratio of cortical to cerebellar amyloid imaging signal (SUVr) and immunohistochemical Î²-amyloid load were analyzed in 6 cortical regions of interest. All AD subgroups had strong and significant correlations between SUVr and histological Î²-amyloid measures (p Î¼ 0.001). All AD subgroups had significantly greater amyloid measures versus nondemented patients, and mean amyloid measures did not significantly differ between AD subgroups. When comparing AD cases with and without each pathology, AD cases with LBs had significantly lower SUVr measures versus AD cases without LBs (p = 0.002); there were no other paired comparison differences. These findings indicate that florbetapir-PET imaging is not confounded by neuropathological heterogeneity within AD.  
24131045	The effect of in-home cognitive training on functional performance of individuals with mild cognitive impairment and early-stage Alzheimer's disease.
Res Gerontol Nurs 20131016 2014 Jan-Feb
This intervention study compared an in-home cognitive training program to life story interview in 68 individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Family caregivers participated in sessions and reinforced learning between sessions. Analyses of covariance controlling for baseline levels were conducted. In comparison with the life story group, participants in the cognitive training group demonstrated significant improvement in all face-name association measures, several of the money-related tasks, and one of two event-related memory tasks. There were no differences in language outcomes or caregiver ratings of functional tasks except shopping. Caregivers in the life story group reported higher perceived satisfaction from being a caregiver. Comparison with earlier studies suggests in-home training is modestly more effective than office-based intervention. Results suggest that improvements are related to specific training and do not generalize to other tasks. Focusing on tasks of critical significance to participant and caregiver is recommended. 
24621910	[Depression or Alzheimer-type dementia?].
Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen. 20140311 2014Mar11
The prevalence of depression and Alzheimer-type dementia in the elderly will increase, they may have similar symptoms, making it difficult to distinguish between these two conditions, and both conditions may occur simultaneously in one and the same patient. This article provides an overview of symptoms and findings that may be important for distinguishing depression from Alzheimer-type dementia. The article is based on a structured search in PubMed of a discretionary selection of studies, as well as the authors' own clinical experience. Depression and Alzheimer-type dementia may share a number of cognitive and affective symptoms, such as amnesia, attention deficit, impaired emotional reactions and a general lack of initiative. Mapping disease progression and daily functioning, information from next of kin, neuropsychological tests, biomarkers and diagnostic imaging of the brain may be helpful in differentiating the diagnoses. Depression and Alzheimer-type dementia in elderly patients can be established by a GP, preferably including an assessment of disease progression, daily functioning, information-gathering from next of kin and cognitive screening. If the GP's examination fails to provide unambiguous answers, or if a young patient is involved, he or she should be referred to the specialist health services. 
24398293	PGC-1Î± overexpression exacerbates Î²-amyloid and tau deposition in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
FASEB J. 20140107 2014Apr
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator 1-Î± (PGC-1Î±) interacts with various transcription factors involved in energy metabolism and in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1Î± mRNA levels are reduced in a number of neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to disease pathogenesis, since increased levels ameliorate behavioral defects and neuropathology of Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. PGC-1Î± and its downstream targets are reduced both in postmortem brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in transgenic mouse models of AD. Therefore, we investigated whether increased expression of PGC-1Î± would exert beneficial effects in the Tg19959 transgenic mouse model of AD; Tg19959 mice express the human amyloid precursor gene (APP) with 2 familial AD mutations and develop increased Î²-amyloid levels, plaque deposition, and memory deficits by 2-3 mo of age. Rather than an improvement, the cross of the Tg19959 mice with mice overexpressing human PGC-1Î± exacerbated amyloid and tau accumulation. This was accompanied by an impairment of proteasome activity. PGC-1Î± overexpression induced mitochondrial abnormalities, neuronal cell death, and an exacerbation of behavioral hyperactivity in the Tg19959 mice. These findings show that PGC-1Î± overexpression exacerbates the neuropathological and behavioral deficits that occur in transgenic mice with mutations in APP that are associated with human AD. 
24421399	Amyloid Î² peptide stimulates platelet activation through RhoA-dependent modulation of actomyosin organization.
FASEB J. 20140113 2014Apr
Platelets contribute to 95% of circulating amyloid precursor protein in the body and have widely been employed as a "peripheral" model of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. We sought to analyze the effects of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) on platelets and to understand the underlying molecular mechanism. The AÎ² active fragment containing amino acid sequence 25-35 (AÎ²(25-35); 10-20 Î¼M) was found to induce strong aggregation of human platelets, granule release, and integrin activation, similar to that elicited by physiological agonists. Platelets exposed to AÎ²(25-35) retracted fibrin clot and displayed augmented adhesion to collagen under arterial shear, reflective of a switch to prothrombotic phenotype. Exposure of platelets to AÎ² peptide (20 Î¼M) resulted in a 4.2- and 2.3-fold increase in phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and MLC phosphatase, respectively, which was reversed by Y27632, an inhibitor of Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK). AÎ²(25-35)-induced platelet aggregation and clot retraction were also significantly attenuated by Y27632. Consistent with these findings, AÎ²(25-35) elicited a significant rise in the level of RhoA-GTP in platelets. Platelets pretreated with reverse-sequenced AÎ² fragment (AÎ²(35-25)) and untreated resting platelets served as controls. We conclude that AÎ² induces cellular activation through RhoA-dependent modulation of actomyosin, and hence, RhoA could be a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 
24569455	Familial Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin-1 alters cerebellar activity and calcium homeostasis.
J. Clin. Invest. 20140224 2014Apr1
Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is characterized by autosomal dominant heritability and early disease onset. Mutations in the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1) are found in approximately 80% of cases of FAD, with some of these patients presenting cerebellar damage with amyloid plaques and ataxia with unclear pathophysiology. A Colombian kindred carrying the PS1-E280A mutation is the largest known cohort of PS1-FAD patients. Here, we investigated PS1-E280A-associated cerebellar dysfunction and found that it occurs early in PS1-E208A carriers, while cerebellar signs are highly prevalent in patients with dementia. Postmortem analysis of cerebella of PS1-E280A carrier revealed greater Purkinje cell (PC) loss and more abnormal mitochondria compared with controls. In PS1-E280A tissue, ER/mitochondria tethering was impaired, Ca2+ channels IP3Rs and CACNA1A were downregulated, and Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial transport proteins MIRO1 and KIF5C were reduced. Accordingly, expression of PS1-E280A in a neuronal cell line altered ER/mitochondria tethering and transport compared with that in cells expressing wild-type PS1. In a murine model of PS1-FAD, animals exhibited mild ataxia and reduced PC simple spike activity prior to cerebellar Î²-amyloid deposition. Our data suggest that impaired calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction in PS1-FAD PCs reduces their activity and contributes to motor coordination deficits prior to AÎ² aggregation and dementia. We propose that PS1-E280A affects both Ca2+ homeostasis and AÎ² precursor processing, leading to FAD and neurodegeneration.  
24639524	AÎ²-induced Golgi fragmentation in Alzheimer's disease enhances AÎ² production.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 20140317 2014Apr1
Golgi fragmentation occurs in neurons of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying molecular mechanism causing the defects and the subsequent effects on disease development remain unknown. In this study, we examined the Golgi structure in APPswe/PS1E9 transgenic mouse and tissue culture models. Our results show that accumulation of amyloid beta peptides (AÎ²) leads to Golgi fragmentation. Further biochemistry and cell biology studies revealed that Golgi fragmentation in AD is caused by phosphorylation of Golgi structural proteins, such as GRASP65, which is induced by AÎ²-triggered cyclin-dependent kinase-5 activation. Significantly, both inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and expression of nonphosphorylatable GRASP65 mutants rescued the Golgi structure and reduced AÎ² secretion by elevating Î±-cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Our study demonstrates a molecular mechanism for Golgi fragmentation and its effects on amyloid precursor protein trafficking and processing in AD, suggesting Golgi as a potential drug target for AD treatment.  
24503948	The S-TOFHLA as a measure of functional literacy in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment.
Arch Clin Neuropsychol 20140205 2014May
In developing countries, education levels vary dramatically, and the number of years of schooling does not always correlate with the true level of educational competency. This study was designed to verify the accuracy of the Short-Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), when compared with healthy controls (HCs), in order to assess its utility as a measure of functional literacy. One hundred forty-eight subjects were divided into three groups: HC (n = 61), MCI patients (n = 42), and AD patients (n = 45). The S-TOFHLA does not seem to be suitable as an instrument to measure functional literacy for patients with advanced cognitive impairment, but proved to be appropriate in both the HC group and MCI patients in numeracy and prove to be useful as an adjuvant to estimate IQ, reading ability, and premorbid IQ, as an indicator of cognitive reserve.  
24382429	Reuse of termino-ontological resources and text corpora for building a multilingual domain ontology: an application to Alzheimer's disease.
J Biomed Inform 20131229 2014Apr
Ontologies are useful tools for sharing and exchanging knowledge. However ontology construction is complex and often time consuming. In this paper, we present a method for building a bilingual domain ontology from textual and termino-ontological resources intended for semantic annotation and information retrieval of textual documents. This method combines two approaches: ontology learning from texts and the reuse of existing terminological resources. It consists of four steps: (i) term extraction from domain specific corpora (in French and English) using textual analysis tools, (ii) clustering of terms into concepts organized according to the UMLS Metathesaurus, (iii) ontology enrichment through the alignment of French and English terms using parallel corpora and the integration of new concepts, (iv) refinement and validation of results by domain experts. These validated results are formalized into a domain ontology dedicated to Alzheimer's disease and related syndromes which is available online (http://lesim.isped.u-bordeaux2.fr/SemBiP/ressources/ontoAD.owl). The latter currently includes 5765 concepts linked by 7499 taxonomic relationships and 10,889 non-taxonomic relationships. Among these results, 439 concepts absent from the UMLS were created and 608 new synonymous French terms were added. The proposed method is sufficiently flexible to be applied to other domains.  
24597646	AlzPlatform: an Alzheimer's disease domain-specific chemogenomics knowledgebase for polypharmacology and target identification research.
J Chem Inf Model 20140320 2014Apr28
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most complicated progressive neurodegeneration diseases that involve many genes, proteins, and their complex interactions. No effective medicines or treatments are available yet to stop or reverse the progression of the disease due to its polygenic nature. To facilitate discovery of new AD drugs and better understand the AD neurosignaling pathways involved, we have constructed an Alzheimer's disease domain-specific chemogenomics knowledgebase, AlzPlatform (www.cbligand.org/AD/ ) with cloud computing and sourcing functions. AlzPlatform is implemented with powerful computational algorithms, including our established TargetHunter, HTDocking, and BBB Predictor for target identification and polypharmacology analysis for AD research. The platform has assembled various AD-related chemogenomics data records, including 928 genes and 320 proteins related to AD, 194 AD drugs approved or in clinical trials, and 405,188 chemicals associated with 1,â€‰023,137 records of reported bioactivities from 38,284 corresponding bioassays and 10,â€‰050 references. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the application of the AlzPlatform in three case studies for identification of multitargets and polypharmacology analysis of FDA-approved drugs and also for screening and prediction of new AD active small chemical molecules and potential novel AD drug targets by our established TargetHunter and/or HTDocking programs. The predictions were confirmed by reported bioactivity data and our in vitro experimental validation. Overall, AlzPlatform will enrich our knowledge for AD target identification, drug discovery, and polypharmacology analyses and, also, facilitate the chemogenomics data sharing and information exchange/communications in aid of new anti-AD drug discovery and development. 
24045327	Incidence rates of dementia, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia in the Japanese American population in Seattle, WA: the Kame Project.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jan-Mar
There are few studies on the incidence of dementia in representative minority populations in the United States; however, no population-based study has been conducted on Japanese American women. We identified 3045 individuals aged 65+ with at least 1 parent of Japanese descent living in King County, WA in the period 1992 to 1994, of whom 1836 were dementia-free and were examined every 2 years (1994 to 2001) to identify incident cases of all dementias, Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and other dementias. Cox regression was used to examine associations with age, sex, years of education, and apolipoprotein (APOE)-Îµ4. Among 173 incident cases of dementia, the overall rate was 14.4/1000/y, with rates being slightly higher among women (15.9/1000) than men (12.5/1000). Rates roughly doubled every 5 years for dementia and AD; the age trend for VaD and other dementias was less consistent. Sex was not significantly related to incidence of dementia or its subtypes in adjusted models. There was a trend for an inverse association with increasing years of education. APOE-Îµ4 was a strong risk factor for all dementias [hazard ratio (HR)=2.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.88-4.46], AD (HR=3.27; 95% CI, 2.03-5.28), and VaD (HR=3.33; 95% CI, 1.34-8.27). This study is the first to report population-based incidence rates for both Japanese American men and women.  
24103379	Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease.
Biol. Psychiatry 20131006 2014Apr1
Psychotic symptoms, delusions and hallucinations, occur in approximately 50% of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (AD with psychosis [AD + P]). Pharmacotherapies for AD + P have limited efficacy and can increase short-term mortality. These observations have motivated efforts to identify the underlying biology of AD + P. Psychosis in AD indicates a more severe phenotype, with more rapid cognitive decline beginning even before psychosis onset. Neuroimaging studies suggest that AD + P subjects demonstrate greater cortical synaptic impairments than AD subjects without psychosis, reflected in reduced gray matter volume, reduced regional blood flow, and reduced regional glucose metabolism. Neuroimaging and available postmortem evidence further indicate that the impairments in AD + P, relative to AD subjects without psychosis, are localized to neocortex rather than medial temporal lobe. Neuropathologic studies provide consistent evidence of accelerated accumulation of hyperphosphorylated microtubule associated protein tau in AD + P. Finally, studies of familial aggregation of AD + P have established that the risk for psychosis in AD is, in part, genetically mediated. Although no genes are established as associated with AD + P, the first genome-wide association study of AD + P has generated some promising leads. The study of the neurobiology of AD + P is rapidly accelerating and may be poised for translational discovery. This process can be enhanced by identifying points of convergence and divergence with the neurobiology of AD proper and of schizophrenia, by innovative extension of current approaches, and by development of relevant animal models.  
23873854	Therapeutic potential of turmeric in Alzheimer's disease: curcumin or curcuminoids?
Phytother Res 20130719 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. There is limited choice in modern therapeutics, and drugs available have limited success with multiple side effects in addition to high cost. Hence, newer and alternate treatment options are being explored for effective and safer therapeutic targets to address AD. Turmeric possesses multiple medicinal uses including treatment for AD. Curcuminoids, a mixture of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, are vital constituents of turmeric. It is generally believed that curcumin is the most important constituent of the curcuminoid mixture that contributes to the pharmacological profile of parent curcuminoid mixture or turmeric. A careful literature study reveals that the other two constituents of the curcuminoid mixture also contribute significantly to the effectiveness of curcuminoids in AD. Therefore, it is emphasized in this review that each component of the curcuminoid mixture plays a distinct role in making curcuminoid mixture useful in AD, and hence, the curcuminoid mixture represents turmeric in its medicinal value better than curcumin alone. The progress in understanding the disease etiology demands a multiple-site-targeted therapy, and the curcuminoid mixture of all components, each with different merits, makes this mixture more promising in combating the challenging disease. 
24523414	Capturing a reactive state of amyloid aggregates: NMR-based characterization of copper-bound Alzheimer disease amyloid Î²-fibrils in a redox cycle.
J. Biol. Chem. 20140212 2014Apr4
The interaction of redox-active copper ions with misfolded amyloid Î² (AÎ²) is linked to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which has been associated with oxidative stress and neuronal damages in Alzheimer disease. Despite intensive studies, it is still not conclusive how the interaction of Cu(+)/Cu(2+) with AÎ² aggregates leads to ROS production even at the in vitro level. In this study, we examined the interaction between Cu(+)/Cu(2+) and AÎ² fibrils by solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and other spectroscopic methods. Our photometric studies confirmed the production of ~60 Î¼M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from a solution of 20 Î¼M Cu(2+) ions in complex with AÎ²(1-40) in fibrils ([Cu(2+)]/[AÎ²] = 0.4) within 2 h of incubation after addition of biological reducing agent ascorbate at the physiological concentration (~1 mM). Furthermore, SSNMR (1)H T1 measurements demonstrated that during ROS production the conversion of paramagnetic Cu(2+) into diamagnetic Cu(+) occurs while the reactive Cu(+) ions remain bound to the amyloid fibrils. The results also suggest that O2 is required for rapid recycling of Cu(+) bound to AÎ² back to Cu(2+), which allows for continuous production of H2O2. Both (13)C and (15)N SSNMR results show that Cu(+) coordinates to AÎ²(1-40) fibrils primarily through the side chain NÎ´ of both His-13 and His-14, suggesting major rearrangements from the Cu(2+) coordination via NÎµ in the redox cycle. (13)C SSNMR chemical shift analysis suggests that the overall AÎ² conformations are largely unaffected by Cu(+) binding. These results present crucial site-specific evidence of how the full-length AÎ² in amyloid fibrils offers catalytic Cu(+) centers. 
24589379	Current understandings and perspectives on non-cancer health effects of benzene: a global concern.
Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 20140301 2014Apr15
Benzene, as a volatile organic compound, is known as one of the main air pollutants in the environment. The aim of this review is to summarize all available evidences on non-cancerous health effects of benzene providing an overview of possible association of exposure to benzene with human chronic diseases, specially, in those regions of the world where benzene concentration is being poorly monitored. A bibliographic search of scientific databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scirus was conducted with key words of "benzene toxic health effects", "environmental volatile organic compounds", "diabetes mellitus and environmental pollutants", "breast cancer and environmental pollution", "prevalence of lung cancer", and "diabetes prevalence". More than 300 peer reviewed papers were examined. Experimental and epidemiologic studies reporting health effects of benzene and volatile organic compounds were included in the study. Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that benzene exposure can lead to numerous non-cancerous health effects associated with functional aberration of vital systems in the body like reproductive, immune, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and respiratory. Chronic diseases have become a health burden of global dimension with special emphasis in regions with poor monitoring over contents of benzene in petrochemicals. Benzene is a well known carcinogen of blood and its components, but the concern of benzene exposure is more than carcinogenicity of blood components and should be evaluated in both epidemiologic and experimental studies. Aspect of interactions and mechanism of toxicity in relation to human general health problems especially endocrine disturbances with particular reference to diabetes, breast and lung cancers should be followed up. 
23805842	Structure- and ligand-based drug design of novel p38-alpha MAPK inhibitors in the fight against the Alzheimer's disease.
J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 20130628 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized microscopically by the presence of amyloid plaques, which are accumulations of beta-amyloid protein inter-neurons, and neurofibrillary tangles formed predominantly by highly phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, which form tangled masses that consume neuronal cell body, possibly leading to neuronal dysfunction and ultimately death. p38Î± mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been implicated in both events associated with AD, tau phosphorylation and inflammation. p38Î± MAPK pathway is activated by a dual phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182 residues. Drug design of p38Î± MAPK inhibitors is mainly focused on small molecules that compete for Adenosine triphosphate in the catalytic site. Here, we used different approaches of structure- and ligand-based drug design and medicinal chemistry strategies based on a selected p38Î± MAPK structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank in complex with inhibitor, as well as others reported in literature. As a result of the virtual screening experiments performed here, as well as molecular dynamics, molecular interaction fields studies, shape and electrostatic similarities, activity and toxicity predictions, and pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties, we have selected 13 compounds that meet the criteria of low or no toxicity potential, good pharmacotherapeutic profile, predicted activities, and calculated values â€‹â€‹comparable with those obtained for the reference compounds, while maintaining the main interactions observed for the most potent inhibitors.  
24779297	Analysis of combined CSF biomarkers in AD diagnosis.
Clin. Lab.  2014
The new proposed diagnostic criteria for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) underline the value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The first aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CSF biomarker Abeta1-42, T-tau, and P-tau in differentiating AD patients in our cohort by means of "pure" biomarkers and in form of a combined analysis of these biomarkers. The second aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of these markers for predicting incipient AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We studied 102 CSF samples: 33 AD [mean age at baseline 71.2 (54-86)], 16 MCI [mean age at baseline 71.3 (57-78)], 24 non AD dementia, including 7 vascular dementia, 4 frontotemporal degeneration, 5 dementia with Lewy Body, and 8 with other dementia [mean age at baseline 72.7 (51-87)] and 32 non-demented neurological patients [mean age at baseline 71.3 (45-87) referred to as control (CO) later in the text]. A double sandwich ELISA (Innotest beta amyloid Abeta1-42, hTau and P-tau181 by Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) was performed to quantify the concentration of the above biomarkers. The three biomarkers were then combined in the IATI index [(measured Ab1-42)/(240 + 1.18 *measured tau)], and in the ratios Abeta1-42/T-tau, Abeta1-42/P-tau, T-tau/Abeta1-42 and P-tau/Abeta1-42. Abeta1-42, T-tau and P-tau181 concentration showed statistically significant differences between AD and CO (327.2 pg/mL +/- 150.2 pg/mL and 659.4 pg/mL +/- 254.2 pg/mL; 508.2 pg/mL +/- 360.2 pg/mL and 305.3 pg/mL +/- 228.9 pg/mL; 82.2 pg/mL +/- 26.1 pg/mL and 45.3 pg/mL +/- 26.4 pg/mL, respectively, p &lt; 0.05), while the difference between AD and MCI was statistically different only for Abeta1-42 (327.2 pg/mL +/- 150.2 pg/mL and 600.8 +/- 271.9 pg/mL, respectively, p &lt; 0.05). The IATI index was 0.5 +/- 0.3 in AD, 0.9 +/- 0.6 in MCI, 1.37 +/- 0.9 in non AD dementia and 1.26 +/- 0.8 in non-demented neurological patients. With a cut-off fixed at 1 the sensitivity and specificity of the IATI index in discriminating AD from CO was 84% and 52%, respectively. This study confirms the great significance of CSF biomarker measurements in AD diagnosis in clinical routine. It is understood that a clinical diagnostic work-up is necessary in the process. Moreover, a biochemical profile of CSF biomarkers requires further investigations. 
24864153	A Platform for Screening Potential Anticholinesterase Fractions and Components Obtained from Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge for Treating Alzheimer's Disease.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140417 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors are widely used for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease to enhance central cholinergic transmission. In this study, a bioactivity-oriented screening platform based on a modified Ellman's method and HPLC-QTOF MS technique was developed to rapidly screen active agents of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge. The 60% ethanol fraction from an ethyl acetate extract exhibited the most potential anticholinesterase activity. Fifteen steroid saponins were identified by the mass spectrum, standards and literature reports. Twenty-five compounds were isolated from the active fraction. The results showed that compounds with the C6-C3-C6 skeleton probably had both AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities. Xanthone and benzene derivatives exhibited no or little activity. Lignans showed weak BuChE inhibitory activity. The steroidal saponins demonstrated moderate or weak AChE inhibitory activity.  
24270207	Hyperphosphorylated tau is elevated in Alzheimer's disease with psychosis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Psychosis occurs in 40-60% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects, is heritable, and indicates a more rapidly progressive disease phenotype. Neuroimaging and postmortem evidence support an exaggerated prefrontal cortical synaptic deficit in AD with psychosis. Microtubule-associated protein tau is a key mediator of amyloid-Î²-induced synaptotoxicity in AD, and differential mechanisms of progressive intraneuronal phospho-tau accumulation and interneuronal spread of tau aggregates have recently been described. We hypothesized that psychosis in AD would be associated with greater intraneuronal concentration of phospho-tau and greater spread of tau aggregates in prefrontal cortex. We therefore evaluated prefrontal cortex phospho-tau in a cohort of 45 AD cases with and without psychosis. Intraneuronal phospho-tau concentration was higher in subjects with psychosis, while a measure of phospho-tau spread, volume fraction, was not. Across groups both measures were associated with lower scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Span Backwards test. These novel findings indicate that tau phosphorylation may be accelerated in AD with psychosis, indicating a more dynamic, exaggerated pathology in AD with psychosis. 
24581495	Hsp90-Tau complex reveals molecular basis for specificity in chaperone action.
Cell  2014Feb27
Protein folding in the cell relies on the orchestrated action of conserved families of molecular chaperones, the Hsp70 and Hsp90 systems. Hsp70 acts early and Hsp90 late in the folding path, yet the molecular basis of this timing is enigmatic, mainly because the substrate specificity of Hsp90 is poorly understood. Here, we obtained a structural model of Hsp90 in complex with its natural disease-associated substrate, the intrinsically disordered Tau protein. Hsp90 binds to a broad region in Tau that includes the aggregation-proneÂ repeats. Complementarily, a 106-Ã…-long substrate-binding interface in Hsp90 enables many low-affinity contacts. This allows recognition of scattered hydrophobic residues in late folding intermediates that remain after early burial of the Hsp70 sites. Our model resolves the paradox of how Hsp90 specifically selects for late folding intermediates but also for some intrinsically disordered proteins-through the eyes of Hsp90 they look the same.  
24684113	[Effects of grain-sized moxibustion on learning and memory ability and amyloid deposition of transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice].
Zhen Ci Yan Jiu  2014Feb
To observe the effect of grain-sized moxibustion at "Xinshu" (BL 15) and "Shenshu" (BL 23) on memory-learning ability and amyloid deposition in transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. seventeen amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin (PS)1 (APP+/PS 1+) double transgenic 6799 mice aged 3-4 weeks were randomly divided into model group (n = 9) and moxibustion group (n = 8). Nine wide-type (C 57 BL/6 J) female mice were used as the normal control group. Moxibustion (ignited grain-sized moxa cone) was applied to bilateral "Xinshu" (BL 15) and "Shenshu" (BL 23) for about 30 s, once a day for 9 courses (10 days constitute a therapeutic course, with 2 days' break between every two courses). Morris water maze tests were performed to detect the mice's learning-memory ability. The alterations of beta-amyloid deposition (number of the positive plaques) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were detected by using an imaging analysis system following Congo red staining of the cerebral tissue sections. Compared with the normal group, the average escape latency of place navigation tests was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05), and the target-platform crossing times and percentage of dwell time in the target quadrant of the spatial exploring tests were notably decreased in the model group (P &lt; 0.05). After moxibustion intervention, the escape latency was remarkably shortened, and the target-platform crossing times and dwell time percentage were obviously increased in the moxibustion group in comparison with the model group (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting an improvement of the learning-memory ability after moxibustion. Results of Congo red staining of the cerebral tissue showed that there were many irregular, uneven staining positive plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of AD mice in the model group. Compared with the model group, the positive plaque numbers in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus were considerably reduced in the moxibustion group (P &lt; 0.05). Grain-sized moxibustion at "Xinshu" (BL 15) and "Shenshu" (BL 23) can ameliorate learning-memory ability and restrain the formation of amyloid deposition in AD mice. 
24424381	Cerebral blood flow is an earlier indicator of perfusion abnormalities than cerebral blood volume in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 20140115 2014Apr
The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) can better characterize perfusion abnormalities in predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than cerebral blood volume (CBV) and whether cortical atrophy is more associated with decreased CBV or with decreased CBF. We compared measurements of CBV, CBF, and mean cortical thickness obtained from magnetic resonance images in a group of healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who converted to AD after 2 years of clinical follow-up (MCI-c), and patients with mild AD. A significant decrease in perfusion was detected in the parietal lobes of the MCI-c patients with CBF parametric maps but not with CBV maps. In the MCI-c group, a negative correlation between CBF values and cortical thickness in the right parahippocampal gyrus suggests an increase in CBF that depends on cortical atrophy in predementia stages of AD. Our study also suggests that CBF deficits appear before CBV deficits in the progression of AD, as CBV abnormalities were only detected at the AD stage, whereas CBF changes were already detected in the MCI stage. These results confirm the hypothesis that CBF is a more sensitive parameter than CBV for perfusion abnormalities in MCI-c patients.  
24591589	Clioquinol promotes the degradation of metal-dependent amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) oligomers to restore endocytosis and ameliorate AÎ² toxicity.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 20140303 2014Mar18
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disorder without effective disease-modifying therapies. The accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) is associated with AD. However, identifying new compounds that antagonize the underlying cellular pathologies caused by AÎ² has been hindered by a lack of cellular models amenable to high-throughput chemical screening. To address this gap, we use a robust and scalable yeast model of AÎ² toxicity where the AÎ² peptide transits through the secretory and endocytic compartments as it does in neurons. The pathogenic AÎ² 1-42 peptide forms more oligomers and is more toxic than AÎ² 1-40 and genome-wide genetic screens identified genes that are known risk factors for AD. Here, we report an unbiased screen of âˆ¼140,000 compounds for rescue of AÎ² toxicity. Of âˆ¼30 hits, several were 8-hydroxyquinolines (8-OHQs). Clioquinol (CQ), an 8-OHQ previously reported to reduce AÎ² burden, restore metal homeostasis, and improve cognition in mouse AD models, was also effective and rescued the toxicity of AÎ² secreted from glutamatergic neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. In yeast, CQ dramatically reduced AÎ² peptide levels in a copper-dependent manner by increasing degradation, ultimately restoring endocytic function. This mirrored its effects on copper-dependent oligomer formation in vitro, which was also reversed by CQ. This unbiased screen indicates that copper-dependent AÎ² oligomer formation contributes to AÎ² toxicity within the secretory/endosomal pathways where it can be targeted with selective metal binding compounds. Establishing the ability of the AÎ² yeast model to identify disease-relevant compounds supports its further exploitation as a validated early discovery platform.  
24292895	Potential involvement of GRIN2B encoding the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B in the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease.
J Neural Transm 20131201 2014May
Increasing evidence links dysregulation of NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor remodelling and trafficking to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This theme offers the possibility that the GRIN2B gene, encoding this selective NR2B subunit, represents a potential molecular modulating factor for this disease. Based on this hypothesis, we carried out a mutation scanning of exons and flanking regions of GRIN2B in a well-characterized cohort of AD patients, recruited from Southern Italy. A "de novo" p.K1293R mutation, affecting a highly conserved residue of the protein in the C-terminal domain, was observed for the first time in a woman with familial AD, as the only genetic alteration of relevance. Moreover, an association study between the other detected sequence variants and AD was performed. In particular, the study was focused on five identified single nucleotide polymorphisms: rs7301328, rs1805482, rs3026160, rs1806191 and rs1806201, highlighting a significant contribution from the GRIN2B rs1806201 T allele towards disease susceptibility [adjusted odds ratio (OR)Â =Â 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.63, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001, after correction for sex, age, and APOE Îµ4 genotype]. This was confirmed by haplotype analysis that identified a specific haplotype, carrying the rs1806201 T allele (CCCTC), over-represented in patients versus controls (adjusted ORÂ =Â 6.03; pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Although the pathogenic role of the GRIN2B-K1293R mutation in AD is not clear, our data advocate that genetic variability in the GRIN2B gene, involved in synaptic functioning, might provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis, continuing to attract significant attention in biomedical research on its genetic and functional role.  
24702005	Fluorogenic resveratrol-confined graphene oxide for economic and rapid detection of Alzheimer's disease.
ACS Appl Mater Interfaces 20140408 2014Apr23
Developing an effective means for the real-time probing of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) that is closely implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could help better understand and monitor the disease. Here we describe an economic approach based on the simple composition of a natural product, resveratrol (Res), with graphene oxide (GO) for the rapid, fluorogenic recognition of AÎ². The Res@GO composite has proved specific for AÎ² over a range of proteins and ions, and could sensitively capture both AÎ² monomers and fibers in a physiological buffer solution within only 3 min. The composite can also fluorescently image amyloid deposits in a mouse brain section within 30 min. This new protocol is much cheaper and more timesaving than the conventional immunofluorescence staining technique employed clinically, providing an economic tool for the concise detection of AD.  
24683126	Gait changes with anti-dementia drugs: a prospective, open-label study combining single and dual task assessments in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Drugs Aging  2014May
No comparison of anti-dementia drugs-related gait changes has been previously conducted combining single and dual task assessments. (1) To quantify and compare gait changes among patients with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease before and after the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (i.e., donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) or memantine, and among controls with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease using no anti-dementia drugs; and (2) to determine whether gait changes differed between acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. A total of 86 patients with mild-to-moderate possible or probable Alzheimer's disease were included in this quasi-experimental study (19 patients using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, 36 patients using memantine and 31 age- and gender-matched patients without anti-dementia drugs). Mean values and coefficient of variation of walking speed and stride time were measured with the GAITRite(Â®) system while usual walking and while walking with backward counting. In single task, patients using memantine had a greater decrease in coefficient of variation of stride time (-2.3 %) compared to those using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (1.3 %, P = 0.043) and no anti-dementia drugs (1.6 %, P = 0.026). In dual task, patients using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors had a greater decrease in coefficient of variation of stride time (-5.5 %) compared to those using memantine (2.0 %, P = 0.002) and no anti-dementia drugs (4.1 %, P = 0.05). Our findings showed a double dissociation in the effect of anti-dementia drugs on gait variability in patients with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease: memantine improves gait variability while single tasking, whereas acetylcholinesterase inhibitors improves gait variability while dual tasking. 
24477323	COMT Val158Met and PPARÎ³ Pro12Ala polymorphisms and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.
Neurol. Sci. 20140130 2014May
The aim of this study was to explore whether the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARÎ³) Pro12Ala polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a meta-analysis of the associations between the COMT Val158Met and the PPARÎ³ Pro12Ala polymorphisms and AD in subjects. Meta-analysis showed no association between AD and the COMT G allele in any of the study subjects [odds ratio (OR) = 0.972, 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) = 0.893-1.059, p = 0.515]. Stratification by ethnicity indicated an association between the COMT GG+GA genotype and AD in an Asian group (OR = 0.702, 95 % CI = 0.517-0.953, p = 0.023), but not in Europeans (OR = 1.058, 95 % CI = 0.868-1.289, p = 0.579). Homozygote contrast analysis showed the same pattern for the COMT GG+GA genotype. Meta-analysis showed no association between AD and the PPARÎ³ polymorphism (OR for the C allele = 0.963, 95 % CI = 0.818-1.134, p = 0.649). This meta-analysis identified an association between AD and the COMT Val158Met polymorphism in Asians but not in Europeans, but it revealed no association between AD and the PPARÎ³ Pro12Ala polymorphism. 
24860476	Music as a mnemonic to learn gesture sequences in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.
Front Hum Neurosci 20140512 2014
Strong links between music and motor functions suggest that music could represent an interesting aid for motor learning. The present study aims for the first time to test the potential of music to assist in the learning of sequences of gestures in normal and pathological aging. Participants with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy older adults (controls) learned sequences of meaningless gestures that were either accompanied by music or a metronome. We also manipulated the learning procedure such that participants had to imitate the gestures to-be-memorized in synchrony with the experimenter or after the experimenter during encoding. Results show different patterns of performance for the two groups. Overall, musical accompaniment had no impact on the controls' performance but improved those of AD participants. Conversely, synchronization of gestures during learning helped controls but seemed to interfere with retention in AD. We discuss these findings regarding their relevance for a better understanding of auditory-motor memory, and we propose recommendations to maximize the mnemonic effect of music for motor sequence learning for dementia care.  
24860545	Three-Class Differential Diagnosis among Alzheimer Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Controls.
Front Neurol 20140512 2014
Biomarkers derived from brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have promise in being able to assist in the clinical diagnosis of brain pathologies. These have been used in many studies in which the goal has been to distinguish between pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and healthy aging. However, other dementias, in particular, frontotemporal dementia, also present overlapping pathological brain morphometry patterns. Hence, a classifier that can discriminate morphometric features from a brain MRI from the three classes of normal aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) would offer considerable utility in aiding in correct group identification. Compared to the conventional use of multiple pair-wise binary classifiers that learn to discriminate between two classes at each stage, we propose a single three-way classification system that can discriminate between three classes at the same time. We present a novel classifier that is able to perform a three-class discrimination test for discriminating among AD, FTD, and normal controls (NC) using volumes, shape invariants, and local displacements (three features) of hippocampi and lateral ventricles (two structures times two hemispheres individually) obtained from brain MR images. In order to quantify its utility in correct discrimination, we optimize the three-class classifier on a training set and evaluate its performance using a separate test set. This is a novel, first-of-its-kind comparative study of multiple individual biomarkers in a three-class setting. Our results demonstrate that local atrophy features in lateral ventricles offer the potential to be a biomarker in discriminating among AD, FTD, and NC in a three-class setting for individual patient classification.  
24860504	Sirtuin modulators control reactive gliosis in an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Pharmacol 20140513 2014
Among neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Several genetic and environmental factors have been identified; however, aging represents the most important risk factor in the development of AD. To date, no effective treatments to prevent or slow this dementia are available. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of NAD(+)-dependent enzymes, implicated in the control of a variety of biological processes that have the potential to modulate neurodegeneration. Here we tested the hypothesis that activation of SIRT1 or inhibition of SIRT2 would prevent reactive gliosis which is considered one of the most important hallmark of AD. Primary rat astrocytes were activated with beta amyloid 1-42 (AÎ² 1-42) and treated with resveratrol (RSV) or AGK-2, a SIRT1 activator and a SIRT2-selective inhibitor, respectively. Results showed that both RSV and AGK-2 were able to reduce astrocyte activation as well as the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. These data disclose novel findings about the therapeutic potential of SIRT modulators, and suggest novel strategies for AD treatment.  
24605809	Amyloid-ÃŸ-directed immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.
J. Intern. Med.  2014Mar
Current treatment options for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are limited to medications that reduce dementia symptoms. Given the rapidly ageing populations in most areas of the world, new therapeutic interventions for AD are urgently needed. In recent years, a number of drug candidates targeting the amyloid-ÃŸ (AÃŸ) peptide have advanced into clinical trials; however, most have failed because of safety issues or lack of efficacy. The AÃŸ peptide is central to the pathogenesis, and immunotherapy against AÃŸ has attracted considerable interest. It offers the possibility to reach the target with highly specific drugs. Active immunization and passive immunization have been the most widely studied approaches to immunotherapy of AD. A favourable aspect of active immunization is the capacity for a small number of vaccinations to generate a prolonged antibody response. A potential disadvantage is the variability in the antibody response across patients. The potential advantages of passive immunotherapy include the reproducible delivery of a known amount of therapeutic antibodies to the patient and rapid clearance of those antibodies if side effects develop. A disadvantage is the requirement for repeated infusions of antibodies over time. After more than a decade of research, anti-amyloid immunotherapy remains one of the most promising emerging strategies for developing disease-modifying treatments for AD. In this review, we examine the presently ongoing AÃŸ-directed immunotherapies that have passed clinical development Phase IIa.  
24316057	MAM (mitochondria-associated membranes) in mammalian cells: lipids and beyond.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20131206 2014Apr4
One mechanism by which communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is achieved is by close juxtaposition between these organelles via mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM). The MAM consist of a region of the ER that is enriched in several lipid biosynthetic enzyme activities and becomes reversibly tethered to mitochondria. Specific proteins are localized, sometimes transiently, in the MAM. Several of these proteins have been implicated in tethering the MAM to mitochondria. In mammalian cells, formation of these contact sites between MAM and mitochondria appears to be required for key cellular events including the transport of calcium from the ER to mitochondria, the import of phosphatidylserine into mitochondria from the ER for decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanolamine, the formation of autophagosomes, regulation of the morphology, dynamics and functions of mitochondria, and cell survival. This review focuses on the functions proposed for MAM in mediating these events in mammalian cells. In light of the apparent involvement of MAM in multiple fundamental cellular processes, recent studies indicate that impaired contact between MAM and mitochondria might underlie the pathology of several human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, MAM has been implicated in modulating glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, as well as in some viral infections.  
24415002	Early fear memory defects are associated with altered synaptic plasticity and molecular architecture in the TgCRND8 Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
J. Comp. Neurol.  2014Jul1
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and slowly progressing dementing disorder that results in neuronal and synaptic loss, deposition in brain of aberrantly folded proteins, and impairment of spatial and episodic memory. Most studies of mouse models of AD have employed analyses of cognitive status and assessment of amyloid burden, gliosis, and molecular pathology during disease progression. Here we sought to understand the behavioral, cellular, ultrastructural, and molecular changes that occur at a pathological stage equivalent to the early stages of human AD. We studied the TgCRND8 mouse, a model of aggressive AD amyloidosis, at an early stage of plaque pathology (3 months of age) in comparison to their wildtype littermates and assessed changes in cognition, neuron and spine structure, and expression of synaptic glutamate receptor proteins. We found that, at this age, TgCRND8 mice display substantial plaque deposition in the neocortex and hippocampus and impairment on cued and contextual memory tasks. Of particular interest, we also observed a significant decrease in the number of neurons in the hippocampus. Furthermore, analysis of CA1 neurons revealed significant changes in apical and basal dendritic spine types, as well as altered expression of GluN1 and GluA2 receptors. This change in molecular architecture within the hippocampus may reflect a rising representation of inherently less stable thin spine populations, which can cause cognitive decline. These changes, taken together with toxic insults from amyloid-Î² protein, may underlie the observed neuronal loss. 
24752600	Cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease and its related factors in a memory clinic setting, Shanghai, China.
PLoS ONE 20140421 2014
Progressive cognitive decline is a characteristic hallmark of AD. It is important to identify prognostic markers to improve patient care and long-term planning. We aimed to identify the characteristics of disease progression in AD patients, focusing on cognitive decline and its related factors. Clinically diagnosed AD patients in a memory clinic were followed. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and a battery of other neuropsychological tests were performed to assess the rate of cognitive decline and to analyze the related factors. A total of 165 AD patients were analyzed for cognitive changes. The MMSE scores declined at a rate of 1.52 points per year. Most neuropsychological test scores deteriorated significantly over time. Younger and early-onset AD patients deteriorated more rapidly than older and late-onset patients in global cognition and executive function. Men declined faster in memory but slower in attention than women. Higher education was associated with more rapid deterioration in visuo-spatial ability. Family history, hypertension and cerebral vascular disease were also associated with disease progression. Attention, executive and visuo-spatial functions deteriorate at faster rates than other cognitive functions in AD patients. Age and age at onset were the main factors that associated with deterioration. 
24326305	A small molecule that displays marked reactivity toward copper- versus zinc-amyloid-Î² implicated in Alzheimer's disease.
Chem. Commun. (Camb.) 20131210 2014May25
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial, neurodegenerative disease that poses tremendous difficulties in pinpointing its precise etiology. A toolkit, which specifically targets and modulates suggested key players, may elucidate their roles in disease onset and progression. We report high-resolution insights on the activity of a small molecule (L2-NO) which exhibits reactivity toward Cu(II)-amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) over Zn(II)-AÎ². 
24495298	Atomic force microscopy to study molecular mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation and toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
Drug Metab. Rev. 20140205 2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia and memory loss for which no cure or effective prevention is currently available. Neurodegeneration in AD is linked to formation of amyloid plaques found in brain tissues of Alzheimer's patients during post-mortem examination. Amyloid plaques are composed of amyloid fibrils and small oligomers - insoluble protein aggregates. Although amyloid plaques are found on the neuronal cell surfaces, the mechanism of amyloid toxicity is still not well understood. Currently, it is believed that the cytotoxicity is a result of the nonspecific interaction of small soluble amyloid oligomers (rather than longer fibrils) with the plasma membrane. In recent years, nanotechnology has contributed significantly to understanding the structure and function of lipid membranes and to the study of the molecular mechanisms of membrane-associated diseases. We review the current state of research, including applications of the latest nanotechnology approaches, on the interaction of lipid membranes with the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide in relation to amyloid toxicity. We discuss the interactions of AÎ² with model lipid membranes with a focus to demonstrate that composition, charge and phase of the lipid membrane, as well as lipid domains and rafts, affect the binding of AÎ² to the membrane and contribute to toxicity. Understanding the role of the lipid membrane in AD at the nanoscale and molecular level will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of amyloid toxicity and may aid into the development of novel preventive strategies to combat AD. 
23993283	Cognitive and neuroimaging evidence of impaired interaction between self and memory in Alzheimer's disease.
Cortex 20130702 2014Feb
In human cognition, self and memory processes strongly interact, as evidenced by the memory advantage for self-referential materials [Self-Reference Effect (SRE) and Self-Reference Recollection Effect (SRRE)]. The current study examined this interaction at the behavioural level and its neural correlates in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Healthy older controls (HC) and AD patients performed trait-adjectives judgements either for self-relevance or for other-relevance (encoding phase). In a first experiment, the encoding and subsequent yes-no recognition phases were administrated in aÂ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. Brain activation as measured by functional MRI (fMRI) was examined during self-relevance judgements and anatomical images were used to search for correlation between the memory advantage for self-related items and grey matter density (GMD). In a second experiment, participants described the retrieval experience that had driven their recognition decisions (familiarity vs recollective experience). The behavioural results revealed that the SRE and SRRE were impaired in AD patients compared to HC participants. Furthermore, verbal reports revealed that the retrieval of self-related information was preferentially associated with the retrieval of contextual details, such as source memory in the HC participants, but less so in the AD patients. Our imaging findings revealed that both groups activated the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) at encoding during self-relevance judgements. However, the variable and limited memory advantage for self-related information was associated with GMD in the lateral prefrontal cortex in the AD patients, a region supporting high-order processes linking self and memory. These findings suggest that even if AD patients engage MPFC during self-referential judgements, the retrieval of self-related memories is qualitatively and quantitatively impaired in relation with altered high-order processes in the lateral PFC.  
24553427	Chronic kidney disease is associated with dementia independent of cerebral small-vessel disease.
Neurology 20140219 2014Mar25
To determine whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with incident dementia independent of cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD) in patients with vascular risk factors. Using data from a Japanese cohort of participants with vascular risk factors in an ongoing observational study from 2001, we evaluated the association between CKD at baseline and incident dementia. Baseline brain MRI was used to determine SVD (lacunar infarction, white matter hyperintensities), medial-temporal atrophy, and subcortical atrophy. Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed for predictors of dementia adjusting for age, sex, APOE Îµ4 allele, educational level, baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score, cerebrovascular events, vascular risk factors, and MRI findings. Of the 600 subjects (mean age 68 Â± 8.3 years, 57% male, 12.8 Â± 2.6 years of education; CKD: 29%), 50 patients with incident dementia (Alzheimer disease: 24; vascular dementia: 18; mixed-type dementia: 5; other types: 3) were diagnosed during the median 7.5-year follow-up. CKD at baseline was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia in models adjusted for age, sex, educational level, and APOE Îµ4 allele. The associations of CKD at baseline remained significant even after additional adjusting for MRI findings and confounding variables (hazard ratio: 1.96 [1.08-3.58], p = 0.026). CKD is independently related to the risk of all-cause dementia in patients with vascular risk factors. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that CKD exerts deleterious effects on dementia incidence. 
24598707	Contribution of Alzheimer disease to mortality in the United States.
Neurology 20140305 2014Mar25
To assess the burden of mortality attributable to Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia in the United States. Data came from 2,566 persons aged 65 years and older (mean 78.1 years) without dementia at baseline from 2 cohort studies of aging with identical annual diagnostic assessments of dementia. Because both studies require organ donation, ascertainment of mortality was complete and dates of death accurate. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) after incident AD dementia were estimated per 10-year age strata from proportional hazards models. Population attributable risk percentage was derived to estimate excess mortality after a diagnosis of AD dementia. The number of excess deaths attributable to AD dementia in the United States was then estimated. Over an average of 8 years, 559 participants (21.8%) without dementia at baseline developed AD dementia and 1,090 (42.4%) died. Median time from AD dementia diagnosis to death was 3.8 years. The mortality HR for AD dementia was 4.30 (confidence interval = 3.33, 5.58) for ages 75-84 years and 2.77 (confidence interval = 2.37, 3.23) for ages 85 years and older (too few deaths after AD dementia in ages 65-74 were available to estimate HR). Population attributable risk percentage was 37.0% for ages 75-84 and 35.8% for ages 85 and older. An estimated 503,400 deaths in Americans aged 75 years and older were attributable to AD dementia in 2010. A larger number of deaths are attributable to AD dementia in the United States each year than the number (&lt;84,000 in 2010) reported on death certificates. 
24568372	Synthesis and multitarget biological profiling of a novel family of rhein derivatives as disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer agents.
J. Med. Chem. 20140310 2014Mar27
We have synthesized a family of rhein-huprine hybrids to hit several key targets for Alzheimer's disease. Biological screening performed in vitro and in Escherichia coli cells has shown that these hybrids exhibit potent inhibitory activities against human acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and BACE-1, dual AÎ²42 and tau antiaggregating activity, and brain permeability. Ex vivo studies with the leads (+)- and (-)-7e in brain slices of C57bl6 mice have revealed that they efficiently protect against the AÎ²-induced synaptic dysfunction, preventing the loss of synaptic proteins and/or have a positive effect on the induction of long-term potentiation. In vivo studies in APP-PS1 transgenic mice treated ip for 4 weeks with (+)- and (-)-7e have shown a central soluble AÎ² lowering effect, accompanied by an increase in the levels of mature amyloid precursor protein (APP). Thus, (+)- and (-)-7e emerge as very promising disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer drug candidates.  
24864324	Creation of the Argentina-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Feb
The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a multisite, longitudinal study that assesses clinical, imaging, genetic, and biospecimen biomarkers through the process of normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. We present the creation of the Argentina-ADNI - the first South American ADNI - and its effort to acquire data comparable with those gathered in other worldwide ADNI centers. 
24681692	Semantic fluency: cognitive basis and diagnostic performance in focal dementias and Alzheimer's disease.
Cortex 20140222 2014May
Semantic fluency is widely used both as a clinical test and as a basic tool for understanding how humans extract information from the semantic store. Recently, major efforts have been made to devise fine-grained scoring procedures to measure the multiple cognitive processes underlying fluency performance. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how many and which independent components are necessary to thoroughly describe performance on the fluency task. Furthermore, whether a combination of multiple indices can improve the diagnostic performance of the test should be assessed. In this study, we extracted multiple indices of performance on the semantic fluency test from a large sample of healthy controls (nÂ =Â 307) and patients (nÂ =Â 145) suffering from three types of focal dementia or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We found that five independent components underlie semantic fluency performance. We argue that these components functionally map onto the generation and application of a search strategy (component 2), to the monitoring of the overall sequence to avoid repetitions (component 3) and out-of-category items (component 4), and to the full integrity of the semantic store (component 5). The integrated and effective work of all these components would relate to a "general effectiveness" component (component 1). Importantly, while all the focal dementia groups were equally impaired on general effectiveness measures, they showed differential patterns of failure in the other components. This finding suggests that the cognitive deficit that impairs fluency differs among the three focal dementia groups: a semantic store deficit in the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (sv-PPA), a strategy deficit in the non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfv-PPA), and an initiation deficit in the behavioural variant of fronto-temporal dementia (bv-FTD). Finally, we showed that the concurrent use of multiple fluency indices improves the diagnostic accuracy of semantic fluency both for focal dementias and for AD. More generally, our study suggests that a formal evaluation of fine-grained patterns of performance would improve the diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological tests.  
24709075	Social influence on associative learning: double dissociation in high-functioning autism, early-stage behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Cortex 20140303 2014May
Most of our learning activity takes place in a social context. I examined how social interactions influence associative learning in neurodegenerative diseases and atypical neurodevelopmental conditions primarily characterised by social cognitive and memory dysfunctions. Participants were individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA, nÂ =Â 18), early-stage behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, nÂ =Â 16) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, nÂ =Â 20). The leading symptoms in HFA and bvFTD were social and behavioural dysfunctions, whereas AD was characterised by memory deficits. Participants received three versions of a paired associates learning task. In the game with boxes test, objects were hidden in six candy boxes placed in different locations on the computer screen. In the game with faces, each box was labelled by a photo of a person. In the real-life version of the game, participants played with real persons. Individuals with HFA and bvFTD performed well in the computer games, but failed on the task including real persons. In contrast, in patients with early-stage AD, social interactions boosted paired associates learning up to the level of healthy control volunteers. Worse performance in the real life game was associated with less successful recognition of complex emotions and mental states in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. Spatial span did not affect the results. When social cognition is impaired, but memory systems are less compromised (HFA and bvFTD), real-life interactions disrupt associative learning; when disease process impairs memory systems but social cognition is relatively intact (early-stage AD), social interactions have a beneficial effect on learning and memory. 
24747504	Tolerability and efficacy of the long-term administration of memantine hydrochloride (MemaryÂ®) in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.
Nihon Ronen Igakkai Zasshi  2014
Memantine hydrochloride (MemaryÂ®), launched in June 2011 in Japan, is used in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. We performed an integrated analysis of data obtained from different clinical studies of memantine hydrochloride conducted between 2002 and 2011 in Japan in order to examine the long-term tolerability and efficacy of this drug at a dose of 20 mg/day. Using clinical studies of memantine hydrochloride performed in Japan between 2002 and 2011, the therapeutic safety and the time course of MMSE scores in 702 subjects who had received memantine hydrochloride were examined. The mean duration of memantine treatment was 798.1 days, with the longest duration of 3,373 days (approximately nine years and two months). The incidence of adverse events every 52 weeks of treatment ranged from 71.0% to 88.9%, and the incidence of adverse drug reactions ranged from 5.6% to 32.1%, with no associations between the incidence of adverse events and the treatment duration. There were no adverse drug reactions specific to the long-term administration of this drug. The occurrence of "adverse events" was the primary reason for drug discontinuation. During the long-term study observation period, there were many cases of adverse events and treatment discontinuation due to the background factors of the subjects, including adverse events associated with aging and progression of the underlying conditions. In addition, treatment discontinuation was also associated with admission to a nursing home or facility due to changes in home nursing care. The degree of MMSE score reduction over time was lower in the patients treated with memantine than the expected MMSE score reduction observed in the untreated patients. Based on these findings, there are no issues regarding the tolerability of memantine hydrochloride administered at a dose of 20 mg/day over the long term. Considering changes in the MMSE score, the results indicated that memantine hydrochloride may inhibit worsening of the cognitive function for long periods of time in patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
24275140	Effects of oxysterols on the blood-brain barrier: implications for Alzheimer's disease.
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 20131122 2014Apr11
Altered brain cholesterol homeostasis plays a key role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). For a long time, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was basically considered as a barrier isolating the brain from circulating cholesterol, however, several lines of evidence now suggest that the BBB strictly regulates the exchanges of sterol between the brain and the peripheral circulation. Oxysterols, synthesized by neurons or by peripheral cells, cross the BBB easily and modulate the expression of several enzymes, receptors and transporters which are involved not only in cholesterol metabolism but also in other brain functions. This review article deals with the way oxysterols impact BBB cells. These perspectives open new routes for designing certain therapeutical approaches that target the BBB so that the onset and/or progression of brain diseases such as AD may be modulated.  
24796089	[Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia].
Nippon Rinsho  2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two major forms of dementia in the elderly, and they had been separated categorically on the basis of pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical operationalized criteria. However, it was claimed that this strict separation might steered toward the overdiagnosis of vascular dementia, this dichotomy has been reevaluated in the light of recent epidemiological and neuropathological knowledge. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is now considered as one of the vascular risk factors to the onset and evolution of Alzheimer's disease. Futhermore, the term "AD with CVD" has been used to classify patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for possible AD and who also present clinical or brain imaging evidence of relevant CVD. 
24796090	[Insulin resistance and cognitive function].
Nippon Rinsho  2014Apr
Risk of Alzheimer disease is increased in patients with diabetes. Insulin resistance is identified as a pathogenic mechanism of impaired cognitive dysfunction. Amyloid beta oligomers cause impaired insulin signaling at IRS-1 via mechanisms of TNFalpha and JNK activation. Attenuation of PI-3 kinase pathway is also involved in the hyper-phosphorylation of Tau. Impairment of orexin function is connected to the age related insulin resistance and shortening of life expectancy. Synapse deterioration and loss via these mechanisms underlying defective brain insulin signaling result in cognitive dysfunction. Stimulation of insulin signaling is a developing therapeutic approach in Alzheimer disease. Nasal insulin administration, thiazolidinedione, and GLP-1 receptor agonist possess neuronal protective effects in the treatment of mild cognitive dysfunction. Further identification of the pathogenic mechanism connecting between Alzheimer disease and insulin resistance contributes to development of novel therapeutics in Alzheimer disease.

Nippon Rinsho  2014Apr
The commonly followed definition of dementia is the one described by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10, World Health Organization) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V, American Psychiatric Association). The most important aspect in the diagnosis of dementia is the assessment of overall mental and functions, including living environment, activities of daily living, cognition, mental status, and behavior. Physicians should diagnose dementia on the basis of not only cognitive test results or radiological findings but also other available information, including that obtained from the families or caregivers. Tests for the quantitative evaluation of cognitive function and dementia include the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hasegawa Dementia Scale Revised (HDS-R), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). 
24796100	[Lipid abnormality].
Nippon Rinsho  2014Apr
Vascular dementia is caused by stroke, so primary and secondary prevention for stroke is extremely important. Effects of statins on stroke prevention in patients are reported from recent randomized controlled trials. Hypercholesterolemia in midlife are related to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in later life. During the past decade, effects of statins for patients with AD are controversial in many subsequent original studies. Accordingly, it remains unknown whether statin therapy have a preventive effect on cognitive decline in patients with AD. As a possible mechanism, hypercholesterolemia may be associated with the progression of AD pathology. As another possible mechanism hypercholesterolemia may be associated with hypoperfusion through the progression of atherosclerosis. 
24796109	[Periodontal disease].
Nippon Rinsho  2014Apr
It has been shown that the inflammatory pathways are activated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs reduces risk to develop AD. It is understood that molecules involved in this inflammation promote pathological processes leading to AD, whereas other molecules work to protect neuron/brain function from toxicity found in AD pathogenesis. Periodontal disease is one of the diseases causing inflammation and recent lines of evidence show the link between these two diseases. In this paper, relationship between periodontitis and AD will be reviewed and the possible mechanisms, by which periodontitis may affect the onset and progression of AD, will be discussed. 
24797507	Lesion Explorer: a video-guided, standardized protocol for accurate and reliable MRI-derived volumetrics in Alzheimer's disease and normal elderly.
J Vis Exp 20140414 2014
Obtaining in vivo human brain tissue volumetrics from MRI is often complicated by various technical and biological issues. These challenges are exacerbated when significant brain atrophy and age-related white matter changes (e.g. Leukoaraiosis) are present. Lesion Explorer (LE) is an accurate and reliable neuroimaging pipeline specifically developed to address such issues commonly observed on MRI of Alzheimer's disease and normal elderly. The pipeline is a complex set of semi-automatic procedures which has been previously validated in a series of internal and external reliability tests(1,2). However, LE's accuracy and reliability is highly dependent on properly trained manual operators to execute commands, identify distinct anatomical landmarks, and manually edit/verify various computer-generated segmentation outputs. LE can be divided into 3 main components, each requiring a set of commands and manual operations: 1) Brain-Sizer, 2) SABRE, and 3) Lesion-Seg. Brain-Sizer's manual operations involve editing of the automatic skull-stripped total intracranial vault (TIV) extraction mask, designation of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF), and removal of subtentorial structures. The SABRE component requires checking of image alignment along the anterior and posterior commissure (ACPC) plane, and identification of several anatomical landmarks required for regional parcellation. Finally, the Lesion-Seg component involves manual checking of the automatic lesion segmentation of subcortical hyperintensities (SH) for false positive errors. While on-site training of the LE pipeline is preferable, readily available visual teaching tools with interactive training images are a viable alternative. Developed to ensure a high degree of accuracy and reliability, the following is a step-by-step, video-guided, standardized protocol for LE's manual procedures.  
24847271	The battle of Alzheimer's Disease - the beginning of the future Unleashing the potential of academic discoveries.
Front Pharmacol 20140509 2014
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting approximately 36 million people worldwide. To date there is no preventive or curative treatment available for AD, and in absence of major progress in therapeutic development, AD manifests a concrete socioeconomic threat. The awareness of the growing problem of AD is increasing, exemplified by the recent G8 Dementia Summit, a meeting held in order to set the stage and steer the compass for the future. Simultaneously, and paradoxically, we have seen key players in the pharmaceutical industry that have recently closed or significantly decreased their R&amp;D spending on AD and other CNS disorders. Given the pressing need for new treatments in this area, other actors need to step-in and enter this drug discovery arena complementing the industrial efforts, in order to turn biological and technological progress into novel therapeutics. In this article, we present an example of a novel drug discovery initiative that in a non-profit setting, aims to integrate with both preclinical and clinical academic groups and pharmaceutical industry to explore the therapeutic potential of new concepts in patients, using novel biology, state of the art technologies and rapid concept testing.  
24851088	Multi-Target Directed Drugs: A Modern Approach for Design of New Drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
Curr Neuropharmacol  2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a multi-faceted pathogenesis. So far, the therapeutic paradigm "one-compound-one-target" has failed and despite enormous efforts to elucidate the pathophysiology of AD, the disease is still incurable. The multiple factors involved in AD include amyloid aggregation to form insoluble neurotoxic plaques of AÎ², hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, oxidative stress, calcium imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction and deterioration of synaptic transmission. These factors together, accentuate changes in the CNS homeostasis, starting a complex process of interconnected physiological damage, leading to cognitive and memory impairment and neuronal death. A recent approach for the rational design of new drug candidates, also called multitarget-directed ligand (MTDL) approach, has gained increasing attention by many research groups, which have developed a variety of hybrid compounds acting simultaneously on diverse biological targets. This review aims to show some recent advances and examples of the exploitation of MTDL approach in the rational design of novel drug candidate prototypes for the treatment of AD.  
24855376	Kynurenic Acid levels in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Alzheimer's disease or dementia with lewy bodies.
Int J Tryptophan Res 20140428 2014
Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is implicated in cognitive functions. Altered concentrations of the compound are found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further studies to determine whether KYNA serves as a biomarker for cognitive decline and dementia progression are required. In this study, we measured CSF KYNA levels in AD patients (n = 19), patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 18), and healthy age-matched controls (Ctrls)) (n = 20) to further explore possible correlations between KYNA levels, cognitive decline, and well-established AD and inflammatory markers. Neither DLB patients nor AD patients showed significantly altered CSF KYNA levels compared to Ctrls. However, female AD patients displayed significantly higher KYNA levels compared to male AD patients, a gender difference not seen in the Ctrl or DLB group. Levels of KYNA significantly correlated with the AD-biomarker P-tau and the inflammation marker soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in the AD patient group. No associations between KYNA and cognitive functions were found. Our study shows that, although KYNA was not associated with cognitive decline in AD or DLB patients, it may be implicated in AD-related hyperphosphorylation of tau and inflammation. Further studies on larger patient cohorts are required to understand the potential role of KYNA in AD and DLB.  
24777654	Cardiovascular effects of drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease.
Drug Saf  2014Jun
Drugs that are used to treat Alzheimer's disease include the acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors (ACHIs) donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Adverse cardiovascular events with these drugs are very uncommon. However, there is evidence that ACHI therapy is associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of syncope and bradycardia. There are also a few reports that these drugs may occasionally be associated with QT prolongation and torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Adverse cardiovascular effects of ACHIs including syncope and bradycardia are less common than their adverse gastrointestinal effects, but they remain important considerations in susceptible individuals. In contrast, animal studies and some observational studies suggest that ACHIs may reduce myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality and have favourable effects on hemodynamics and survival in heart failure. Further research is required to confirm these potential beneficial effects. Little is known about the cardiovascular effects of memantine but there have been reports of bradycardia and reduced cardiovascular survival associated with its use.  
24519981	High molecular mass assemblies of amyloid-Î² oligomers bind prion protein in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Brain 20140210 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and the generation of oligomeric species of amyloid-Î² is causal to the initiation and progression of it. Amyloid-Î² oligomers bind to the N-terminus of plasma membrane-bound cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) initiating a series of events leading to synaptic degeneration. Composition of bound amyloid-Î² oligomers, binding regions within PrP(C), binding affinities and modifiers of this interaction have been almost exclusively studied in cell culture or murine models of Alzheimer's disease and our knowledge on PrP(C)-amyloid-Î² interaction in patients with Alzheimer's disease is limited regarding occurrence, binding regions in PrP(C), and size of bound amyloid-Î² oligomers. Here we employed a PrP(C)-amyloid-Î² binding assay and size exclusion chromatography on neuropathologically characterized Alzheimer's disease and non-demented control brains (n = 15, seven female, eight male, average age: 79.2 years for Alzheimer's disease and n = 10, three female, seven male, average age: 66.4 years for controls) to investigate amyloid-Î²-PrP(C) interaction. PrP(C)-amyloid-Î² binding always occurred in Alzheimer's disease brains and was never detected in non-demented controls. Neither expression level of PrP(C) nor known genetic modifiers of Alzheimer's disease, such as the PrP(C) codon 129 polymorphism, influenced this interaction. In Alzheimer's disease brains, binding of amyloid-Î² to PrP(C) occurred via the PrP(C) N-terminus. For synthetic amyloid-Î²42, small oligomeric species showed prominent binding to PrP(C), whereas in Alzheimer's disease brains larger protein assemblies containing amyloid-Î²42 bound efficiently to PrP(C). These data confirm Alzheimer's disease specificity of binding of amyloid-Î² to PrP(C) via its N-terminus in a large cohort of Alzheimer's disease/control brains. Differences in sizes of separated protein fractions between synthetic and brain-derived amyloid-Î² binding to PrP(C) suggest that larger assemblies of amyloid-Î² or additional non-amyloid-Î² components may play a role in binding of amyloid-Î²42 to PrP(C) in Alzheimer's disease.  
24519982	Biochemical stages of amyloid-Î² peptide aggregation and accumulation in the human brain and their association with symptomatic and pathologically preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
Brain 20140210 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-Î² peptide in the brain. N-terminal truncation resulting in the formation of AÎ²N3pE and phosphorylation at serine 8 have been reported to modify aggregation properties of amyloid-Î². Biochemically, soluble, dispersible, membrane-associated, and insoluble, plaque-associated amyloid-Î² aggregates have been distinguished. Soluble and dispersible amyloid-Î² aggregates are both in mixture with the extracellular or intracellular fluid but dispersible aggregates can be cleared from proteins in solution by ultracentrifugation. To clarify the role of phosphorylated amyloid-Î² and AÎ²N3pE in soluble, dispersible, membrane-associated, and plaque-associated amyloid-Î² aggregates in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease we studied brains from 21 cases with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, 33 pathologically preclinical Alzheimer's disease cases, and 20 control cases. Western blot analysis showed that soluble, dispersible, membrane-associated and plaque-associated amyloid-Î² aggregates in the earliest preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease did not exhibit detectable amounts of AÎ²N3pE and phosphorylated amyloid-Î². This stage was referred to as biochemical stage 1 of amyloid-Î² aggregation and accumulation. In biochemical amyloid-Î² stage 2, AÎ²N3pE was additionally found whereas phosphorylated amyloid-Î² was restricted to biochemical amyloid-Î² stage 3, the last stage of amyloid-Î² aggregation. Phosphorylated amyloid-Î² was seen in the dispersible, membrane-associated, and plaque-associated fraction. All cases with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in our sample fulfilled biochemical amyloid-Î² stage 3 criteria, i.e. detection of phosphorylated amyloid-Î². Most, but not all, cases with pathologically preclinical Alzheimer's disease had biochemical amyloid-Î² stages 1 or 2. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the hierarchical occurrence of amyloid-Î², AÎ²N3pE, and phosphorylated amyloid-Î² in amyloid plaques. Phosphorylated amyloid-Î² containing plaques were, thereby, seen in all symptomatic cases with Alzheimer's disease but only in a few non-demented control subjects. The biochemical amyloid-Î² stages correlated with the expansion of amyloid-Î² plaque deposition and with that of neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Taken together, we demonstrate that AÎ²N3pE and phosphorylated amyloid-Î² are not only detectable in plaques, but also in soluble and dispersible amyloid-Î² aggregates outside of plaques. They occur in a hierarchical sequence that allows the distinction of three stages. In light of our findings, it is tempting to speculate that this hierarchical, biochemical sequence of amyloid-Î² aggregation and accumulation is related to disease progression and may be relevant for an increasing toxicity of amyloid-Î² aggregates.  
24605805	Harmonized diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease: recommendations.
J. Intern. Med.  2014Mar
Two major sets of criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) recently have been published, one from an International Working Group (IWG) and the other from working groups convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA) in the United States. These criteria both aim to support a clinical diagnosis with in vivo evidence of AD pathology, using imaging methods and detection of biofluid biomarkers, and emphasize an aetiological diagnosis even in the prodromal stages of the disorder. Nonetheless, there are substantial differences in these two sets of criteria. An international group of investigators with experience in the clinical diagnosis of AD met at the Key Symposium in Stockholm, Sweden on 6 &amp; 7 December 2012, to develop recommendations to harmonize these criteria. The group was led by individuals who were integral to the development of both the IWG and the NIA-AA criteria. The similarities and differences between the two sets of criteria were identified and open discussion focused on ways to resolve the differences and thus yield a harmonized set of criteria. Based on both published evidence as well as the group's collective clinical experience, the group was tasked with achieving consensus, if not unanimity, as it developed recommendations for harmonized clinical diagnostic criteria for AD. The recommendations are to: (i) define AD as a brain disorder, regardless of clinical status; (ii) refer to the clinically expressed disorder, including its prodromal stages, as symptomatic AD; (iii) after the successful completion of standardization efforts, consider incorporating biomarkers into diagnostic algorithms for AD; and (iv) allow nonamnestic, atypical presentations to be included as symptomatic AD, especially when there is supportive biomarker evidence. 
24605806	Mild cognitive impairment: a concept in evolution.
J. Intern. Med.  2014Mar
The construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has evolved over the past 10 years since the publication of the new MCI definition at the Key Symposium in 2003, but the core criteria have remained unchanged. The construct has been extensively used worldwide, both in clinical and in research settings, to define the grey area between intact cognitive functioning and clinical dementia. A rich set of data regarding occurrence, risk factors and progression of MCI has been generated. Discrepancies between studies can be mostly explained by differences in the operationalization of the criteria, differences in the setting where the criteria have been applied, selection of subjects and length of follow-up in longitudinal studies. Major controversial issues that remain to be further explored are algorithmic versus clinical classification, reliability of clinical judgment, temporal changes in cognitive performances and predictivity of putative biomarkers. Some suggestions to further develop the MCI construct include the tailoring of the clinical criteria to specific populations and to specific contexts. The addition of biomarkers to the clinical phenotypes is promising but requires deeper investigation. Translation of findings from the specialty clinic to the population setting, although challenging, will enhance uniformity of outcomes. More longitudinal population-based studies on cognitive ageing and MCI need to be performed to clarify all these issues. 
24605807	Advances in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
J. Intern. Med.  2014Mar
Definitions and diagnostic criteria for all medical conditions are regularly subjected to reviews and revisions as knowledge advances. In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, it has taken almost three decades for diagnostic nomenclature to undergo major re-examination. The shift towards presymptomatic and pre-dementia stages of AD has brought prevention and treatment trials much closer to each other than before. Here we discuss: (i) the impact of diagnostic reliability on the possibilities for developing preventive strategies for AD; (ii) the scientific evidence to support moving from observation to action; (iii) ongoing intervention studies; and (iv) the methodological issues and prospects for balancing strategies for high-risk individuals with those for broad population-based prevention. The associations between neuropathology and cognition are still not entirely clear. In addition, the risk factors for AD dementia and the neuropathological hallmarks of AD may not necessarily be the same. Cognitive impairment has a clearer clinical significance and should therefore remain the main focus of prevention. Risk/protective factors for dementia/AD need to be studied from a life-course perspective. New approaches in prevention trials include enrichment strategies based on genetic risk factors or beta-amyloid biomarkers (at least four ongoing pharmacological trials), and multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting various vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors (at least three ongoing trials). Experience from prevention programmes in other chronic diseases can provide additional methodological improvements. Building infrastructures for international collaborations is necessary for managing the worldwide public health problem of AD and dementia. The International Database on Aging and Dementia (IDAD) and the European Dementia Prevention Initiative (EDPI) are examples of ongoing international efforts aiming to improve the methodology of preventive studies and provide the basis for larger intervention trials. 
24605808	Clinical trials and late-stage drug development for Alzheimer's disease: an appraisal from 1984 to 2014.
J. Intern. Med.  2014Mar
The modern era of drug development for Alzheimer's disease began with the proposal of the cholinergic hypothesis of memory impairment and the 1984 research criteria for Alzheimer's disease. Since then, despite the evaluation of numerous potential treatments in clinical trials, only four cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine have shown sufficient safety and efficacy to allow marketing approval at an international level. Although this is probably because the other drugs tested were ineffective, inadequate clinical development methods have also been blamed for the failures. Here, we review the development of treatments for Alzheimer's disease during the past 30 years, considering the drugs, potential targets, late-stage clinical trials, development methods, emerging use of biomarkers and evolution of regulatory considerations in order to summarize advances and anticipate future developments. We have considered late-stage Alzheimer's disease drug development from 1984 to 2013, including individual clinical trials, systematic and qualitative reviews, meta-analyses, methods, commentaries, position papers and guidelines. We then review the evolution of drugs in late clinical development, methods, biomarkers and regulatory issues. Although a range of small molecules and biological products against many targets have been investigated in clinical trials, the predominant drug targets have been the cholinergic system and the amyloid cascade. Trial methods have evolved incrementally: inclusion criteria have largely remained focused on mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease criteria, recently extending to early or prodromal Alzheimer disease or 'mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease', for drugs considered to be disease modifying. The duration of trials has remained at 6-12 months for drugs intended to improve symptoms; 18- to 24-month trials have been established for drugs expected to attenuate clinical course. Cognitive performance, activities of daily living, global change and severity ratings have persisted as the primary clinically relevant outcomes. Regulatory guidance and oversight have evolved to allow for enrichment of early-stage Alzheimer's disease trial samples using biomarkers and phase-specific outcomes. In conclusion, validated drug targets for Alzheimer's disease remain to be developed. Only drugs that affect an aspect of cholinergic function have shown consistent, but modest, clinical effects in late-phase trials. There is opportunity for substantial improvements in drug discovery and clinical development methods. 
24605810	Health economic evaluation of treatments for Alzheimer's disease: impact of new diagnostic criteria.
J. Intern. Med.  2014Mar
The socio-economic impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias is enormous, and the potential economic challenges ahead are clear given the projected future numbers of individuals with these conditions. Because of the high prevalence and cost of dementia, it is very important to assess any intervention from a cost-effectiveness viewpoint. The diagnostic criteria for preclinical AD suggested by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association workgroups in combination with the goal of effective disease-modifying treatment (DMT) are, however, a challenge for clinical practice and for the design of clinical trials. Key issues for future cost-effectiveness studies include the following: (i) the consequences for patients if diagnosis is shifted from AD-dementia to predementia states, (ii) bridging the gap between clinical trial populations and patients treated in clinical practice, (iii) translation of clinical trial end-points into measures that are meaningful to patients and policymakers/payers and (iv) how to measure long-term effects. To improve cost-effectiveness studies, long-term population-based data on disease progression, costs and outcomes in clinical practice are needed not only in dementia but also in predementia states. Reliable surrogate end-points in clinical trials that are sensitive to detect effects even in predementia states are also essential as well as robust and validated modelling methods from predementia states that also take into account comorbidities and age. Finally, the ethical consequences of early diagnosis should be considered.  
24749173	Pathways to Alzheimer's disease.
J. Intern. Med.  2014Mar
Recent trials of anti-amyloid agents have not produced convincing improvements in clinical outcome in Alzheimer's disease; however, the reason for these poor or inconclusive results remains unclear. Recent genetic data continue to support the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease with protective variants being found in the amyloid gene and both common low-risk and rare high-risk variants for disease being discovered in genes that are part of the amyloid response pathways. These data support the view that genetic variability in how the brain responds to amyloid deposition is a potential therapeutic target for the disease, and are consistent with the notion that anti-amyloid therapies should be initiated early in the disease process. 
24630532	[Awareness disorders in Alzheimer's disease and in mild cognitive impairment].
Encephale 20140311 2014Apr
Awareness disorders in Alzheimer's disease still remains unclear despite much research regarding this phenomenon. Papers report various and contrasted results with varying frequency from one study to another. Hence, the interest in awareness in Alzheimer's disease remains limited. Nevertheless, this symptom is closely associated with caregivers' burden and increases the patient's dependency, since the patient is unable to avoid dangers, requiring some care services or institutionalization The purpose of this current review is to recall the main neuro-anatomical and theoretical basis of awareness disorders, and to highlight the recent findings in Alzheimer's disease and in its pre-clinical stages. With this in mind, we have conducted a non-exhaustive search using the pubmed online database to collect the most important reviews and the most recent findings regarding awareness disorders in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and/or in Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, the links between awareness disorders and other variables, such as severity of dementia or depression, change from one study to the other and do not permit one to understand whether unawareness is an intrinsic or extrinsic reaction to the pathological process itself. Recent results suggest executive, cognitive and behavioral correlates more than psychopathological correlates, although the latter cannot be excluded. In Mild Cognitive Impairment, studies show varied results. Some studies report that patients suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment can be compared to healthy control subjects and both groups have better awareness than patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, other studies show contrary results and awareness disorders might be a predictor of conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to dementia, as with apathy, in which the ability to cope with difficulties represents one of the main features. These controversial results are due to the heterogeneity of Alzheimer patients and in particular of MCI patients, but also to various conceptions of awareness disorders in Alzheimer's disease; none of them, however, taking into account all its diversity and complexity. Thus, neurological approaches underline neuropsychological dysfunctions linked to right frontal and/or hemispheric damage but are based on brain injury or strokes, which are events that differ greatly from a neurodegenerative disease involving progressive cognitive, emotional and social disturbances. Psychiatric approaches have taken into account the various aspects of insight, which before were often forbidden and reduced to a categorical point of view, and so could contribute to a better understanding of awareness disorders in Alzheimer's disease. However, these aspects have been conceptualized for psychiatric patients, suffering from positive symptoms, where compliance in treatment is the central key. Insight in neurological diseases is more focused on negative symptoms and generally concerns a basic perception of impairments in mainly cognitive domains. Moreover, modeling has often opposed neurological and psychological mechanisms, so awareness disorders are out of scope of a primary and secondary symptomatology. Although some authors have proposed to take into account these two mechanisms (unawareness and denial), clinical practice has shown that it was impossible to distinguish them both. Finally, some social cognitive approaches are able to demonstrate that there is no correlation between severity of dementia and awareness disorders. Nevertheless, the Self-concept, underlying this point of view, does not permit distinguishing neuropsychological from psycho-social factors. Moreover, only one evaluation tool based on Self-modeling in Alzheimer's disease exists, and to conceptualize Self in a specific pathology does not permit the comparison of this pathology to others or to healthy control subjects. So, the authors present the multidimensional model proposed by Clare et al., and some perspectives to stimulate future research, and perform potential meta-analyses. 
24418614	Lysosomal alkalization and dysfunction in human fibroblasts with the Alzheimer's disease-linked presenilin 1 A246E mutation can be reversed with cAMP.
Neuroscience 20140110 2014Mar28
Mutation in presenilin 1 (PS1) is one of the leading causes of familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD). PS1 mutation exacerbates the autophagic and lysosomal pathology in AD patients, leading to accumulation of partially degraded material in bloated lysosomes and autophagosomes - a pathology that bears some resemblance to other diseases characterized by elevated lysosomal pH, like age-related macular degeneration. In this study, we examined the effect of the PS1-fAD mutation A246E on lysosomal pH and lysosomal function, and asked whether restoration of lysosomal pH could reverse some of these changes. Lysosomal pH was elevated by 0.2-0.3 pH units in human fibroblasts with the PS1-fAD mutation. The lysosomal alkalization in PS1-fAD fibroblasts was supported by a reduction in the pH-dependent cleavage of cathepsin D and by a reduction in binding of boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) FL-pepstatin A to the cathepsin D active site. PS1-fAD cells had increased LC3B-II/-I ratios and p62 levels, consistent with impaired lysosomal degradation and analogous to changes induced by lysosomal alkalinization with chloroquine. PS1-fAD fibroblasts had increased expression of ATP6V1B2, ATG5, BECN1 TFEB mRNA, and of ATP6V1B2, ATG5 and beclin at the protein level, consistent with chronic impairment of autophagic and lysosomal functions in the mutant cells. Critically, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) treatment reacidified lysosomal pH in mutant PS1-fAD; cAMP also increased the availability of active cathepsin D and lowered the LC3B-II/-I ratio. These results confirm a small elevation in the lysosomal pH of human PS1-fAD fibroblasts, demonstrate that this lysosomal alkalization is associated with chronic changes in autophagy and degradation, and suggest that treatment to reacidify the lysosomes with cAMP can reverse these changes.  
24581918	Evaluation of nicotine and cotinine analogs as potential neuroprotective agents for Alzheimer's disease.
Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 20140214 2014Mar15
The currently available therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related forms of dementia are limited by modest efficacy, adverse side effects, and the fact that they do not prevent the relentless progression of the illness. The purpose of the studies described here was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the nicotine metabolite cotinine as well as a small series of cotinine and nicotine analogs (including stereoisomers) and to compare their effects to the four clinically prescribed AD therapies.  
24604742	Apolipoprotein E receptor pathways in Alzheimer disease.
Wiley Interdiscip Rev Syst Biol Med 20140306 2014 May-Jun
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of patients worldwide. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the formation of neurotoxic oligomers composed of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides is the main mechanism that causes synaptic dysfunction and, eventually, neuronal cell death in this condition. Intriguingly, apolipoprotein E (apoE), the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, emerges as a key factor that contributes to many aspects of the amyloid cascade including the clearance of AÎ² from brain interstitial fluid and the ability of this peptide to form neurotoxic oligomers. Central to the activity of apoE in the healthy and in the diseased brain are apoE receptors that interact with this protein to mediate its multiple cellular and systemic effects. This review describes the molecular interactions that link apoE and its cellular receptors with neuronal viability and function, and how defects in these pathways in the brain promote neurodegeneration.

24461717	Evaluation of full costs of care for patients with Alzheimer's disease in France: the predominant role of informal care.
Health Policy 20140108 2014May
It is crucial that the cost of Alzheimer's disease be evaluated, from a societal perspective, since the number of patients is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades. This assessment of the full cost of care for community-dwelling patients with Alzheimer's disease in France also addresses the factors associated with informal care, its predominant component. From 2009 to 2010, 57 patient/informal caregiver pairs were interviewed using the Resource Utilization in Dementia questionnaire, adapted to provide a micro-costing approach of the overall care process. Both the opportunity cost method and the proxy good method were used to value informal care. Ordinary least square regression was performed to determine factors associated with informal care. Average total monthly costs were â‚¬2450 with the proxy good method and â‚¬3102 with the opportunity cost method. Living with the patient, severity of dementia and hours spent on formal care were significantly associated with informal care time. Since French allowance cannot cover all formal and informal non-medical costs, the choice for policy makers is either to spend more on formal care or to develop family care by investing in supportive programmes for informal caregivers.

Aggregation of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) fragments is one of the major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous study has demonstrated that a novel compound named N-[2-(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl) ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide (gx-50) can decrease the accumulation of AÎ² oligomers in the cerebral cortex and improve the cognitive abilities in transgenic demented mice. To further study the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of gx-50 against AD, we employed microarray to investigate the gene expression profile of the primary cultured neurons treated with gx-50 or/and AÎ². Microarray disclosed 351 genes associated with AD in the gx-50 plus AÎ² treated group, out of the 22,523 probes. 217 of the 351 genes were significantly up-regulated, 134 of them were down-regulated. The 351 genes were mainly involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, nervous system development, protein phosphorylation, transcription and apoptosis. By the Onto-pathway analysis, a network involved two molecules - GSK-3, CREB and another two closely linked proteins - AKT, BDNF was discovered. The GSK/CREB pathway was further studied at the gene and protein level both inÂ vivo and inÂ vitro. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the gx-50 elevated the AKT phosphorylation and inhibited its downstream protein - GSK-3's activity, then restored the CREB's transcriptional activity, and finally enhanced the expression of the CREB target gene - BDNF. In addition, the real-time PCR results displayed the same tendency. In conclusion, studies in this research indicated that the gx-50 may improve the cognitive ability of AD via the GSK-3/CREB pathway.  
24631967	Altered cerebral vascular volumes and solute transport at the blood-brain barriers of two transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropharmacology 20140312 2014Jun
We evaluated the integrity and function of the blood-brain barrier in 3xTg-AD mice aged 3-18 months and in APP/PS1 mice aged 8-months to determine the impacts of changes in amyloid and tau proteins on the brain vascular changes. The vascular volume (Vvasc) was sub-normal in 3xTg-AD mice aged from 6 to 18 months, but not in the APP/PS1 mice. The uptakes of [(3)H]-diazepam by the brains of 3xTg-AD, APP/PS1 and their age-matched control mice were similar at all the times studied, suggesting that the simple diffusion of small solutes is unchanged in transgenic animals. The uptake of d-glucose by the brains of 18-month old 3xTg-AD mice, but not by those of 8-month old APP/PS1 mice, was reduced compared to their age-matched controls. Accordingly, the amount of Glut-1 protein was 1.4 times lower in the brain capillaries of 18 month-old 3xTg-AD mice than in those of age-matched control mice. We conclude that the brain vascular volume is reduced early in 3xTg-AD mice, 6 months before the appearance of pathological lesions, and that this reduction persists until they are at least 18 months old. The absence of alterations in the BBB of APP/PS1 mice suggests that hyperphosphorylated tau proteins contribute to the vascular changes that occur in AD.

24843370	Factors associated with caregiver burden in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Psychiatry Investig 20140411 2014Apr
Caregivers for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffer from psychological and financial burdens. However, the results of the relationship between burden and cognitive function, performance of activities of daily living, and depressive symptoms have remained inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine which factors are more significant predictors of heightened burden, cognitive impairment or functional decline, besides neuropsychiatric symptoms. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample comprised of 1,164 pairs of patients with AD and caregivers from the Clinical Research of Dementia of South Korea study cohorts. The cognitive function of each sub-domain, functional impairments, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden were assessed using the dementia version of Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB-D), Barthel Index for Daily Living Activities (ADL), Seoul-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (S-IADL), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Box (CDR-SB), the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), the Korean version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (K-NPI), and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. We found that higher severity (higher CDR-SB and GDS scores) and more functional impairment (lower ADL and higher S-IADL scores) were significantly associated with higher caregiver burden. In addition, depressive symptoms of patients (higher Geriatric Depression Scale scores) were associated with higher caregiver burden. Therefore, interventions to help maintain activities of daily living in patients with AD may alleviate caregiver burden and improve caregiver well-being. 
24568732	Age-dependent effects of valproic acid in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice are associated with nerve growth factor (NGF) regulation.
Neuroscience 20140222 2014Apr25
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive impairment. Major pathophysiological AD characteristics include numerous senile plaque, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss in the specific regions of patients' brains. In this study, we aimed to understand disease stage-dependent regulation of histone modification for the expression of specific markers in plasma and the hippocampus of in vivo AD model. Since the control of histone acetylation/deacetylation has been studied as one of major epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for specific gene expression, we detected the effects of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor on marker expression and neuroprotection in in vivo AD model mice. We determined the effects of valproic acid (VPA, HDAC inhibitor), on the levels of cytokines, secreted form of APP (sAPP), nerve growth factor (NGF), and cognitive function in Tg6799 AD mice in three different disease stages (1month: pre-symptomatic; 5months: early symptomatic; and 10months: late-symptomatic stages). VPA decreased the mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-ÎºB) and IL-1ÃŸ in the plasma of Tg6799 mice compared to vehicle control at 10months of age. VPA increased the protein levels of NGF in the hippocampus of Tg6799 mice at 5 and 10months of age. In addition, VPA decreased escape latencies of Tg6799 mice at 5 and 10months of age in Morris water maze assessment. Taken together, HDAC inhibition is a promising therapeutic target for AD and it needs to be considered in an age-dependent and/or stage-dependent manner.  
24333192	The dendritic hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
Brain Res. Bull. 20131212 2014Apr
Converging evidence indicates that processes occurring in and around neuronal dendrites are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. These data support the concept of a "dendritic hypothesis" of AD, closely related to the existing synaptic hypothesis. Here we detail dendritic neuropathology in the disease and examine how AÎ², tau, and AD genetic risk factors affect dendritic structure and function. Finally, we consider potential mechanisms by which these key drivers could affect dendritic integrity and disease progression. These dendritic mechanisms serve as a framework for therapeutic target identification and for efforts to develop disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. 
24676499	Endo- and exocytic budding transformation of slow-diffusing membrane domains induced by Alzheimer's amyloid beta.
Phys Chem Chem Phys  2014May21
Cell-sized liposomes are a powerful tool for clarifying physicochemical mechanisms that govern molecular interactions. Herein, budding transformation of membrane domains was induced by amyloid beta peptides. The peptides increased the membrane viscosity as demonstrated by the Brownian motion of membrane domains. These results could aid in understanding the physicochemical mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.  
24748780	Public-private partnerships improve health outcomes in individuals with early stage Alzheimer's disease.
Clin Interv Aging 20140410 2014
In a collaborative effort between the Missouri Department of Health, Area Agencies on Aging (AAA), Alzheimer Association, and academic researchers, we tested whether early dementia detection and comprehensive care consultations would improve health outcomes in care receivers (CRs) and their family caregivers (FCGs), therefore addressing an important public health concern. A total of 244 community-dwelling older adults screened for early-stage dementia by the AAA field staff were referred to the Alzheimer Association and participated in Project Learn MORE (Missouri Outreach and Referral Expanded) (PLM) - a 2-year, nonrandomized multisite intervention consisting of comprehensive care consultations to improve coping skills. PLM participants were compared against 96 controls receiving the Alzheimer Association's "usual services" between January 2011 and December 2012. We examined CR and FCG outcomes, including burden, care confidence, and mood, as effects of PLM, on delaying transitions in level of care. CRs showed improved knowledge (P=0.002) and reduced depression (P=0.007), while FCGs demonstrated improved knowledge (P=0.003) and ability to identify sources of support for the CR (P=0.032) and for themselves (P=0.043). However, FCGs were more burdened after PLM (P=0.02), due to increased awareness of Alzheimer's disease. PLM delayed transitions in care (odds ratio [OR] 3.32, 95% confidence level [CI]: 1.25-8.83) with the number needed to treat =6.82. PLM was successful in improving detection of incident cases of dementia in the community and in connecting patients and their families with needed services. Our findings support the use of state agencies and community service partners to detect dementia. Early implementation of psychosocial interventions could have significant impact in improving patient- and family-centered outcomes, potentially providing a cost-efficient alternative to pharmacotherapy. 
24820272	[Effect of AÎ²1-42 injection on hippocampus cells in rats and protective role of polygona-polysaccharose for Alzheimer's disease].
Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban  2014Apr
To determine the effect of polygona-polysaccharose (PP) on learning and memory ability in rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Forty five Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into 3 groups. Rats in the sham-operated group were injected with normal saline. Rats in the AÎ² group were injected with AÎ²1-42. Rats in the PP group were injected with 16% PP solution for 45 days consecutively. The Morris water maze was used to investigate the ability of learning and memory in the rats. The effect of AÎ² and PP on the hippocampus cells was observed by HE and Congo red staining of methanol. Rats in the sham-operated group had no obvious morphological change; and morphology of rats in the PP group was basicaly normal. The layer of pyramidal cells in the AÎ² group was decreased. The cells appeared sparse and irregular and became smaller. Karyopyknosis and vacuolar degeneration cells were also found. More positive staining materials aggradated in the AÎ² group compared with the PP group by Congo red staining (P&lt;0.05). AÎ² infusion into the hippocampus results in the impairment of the neuronal degeneration in the rats, which shows similar characterizations of AD. PP can reduce the deposition of AÎ² in the hippocampus. 
24802806	Serotonergic therapies for cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: rationale and current status.
Drugs  2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people. Research focused on identifying compounds that restore cognition and memory in AD patients is a very active investigational pursuit. Cholinesterase inhibitors for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive decline in AD have been in use for more than a decade but provide only modest benefits in most patients. Preclinical research is constantly providing new information on AD. The involvement of the serotonergic system in higher cognitive processes such as memory and learning has been widely described and extensive serotonergic denervation has been reported in AD. This review aims to explain the rationale behind testing serotonergic therapies for AD in terms of current knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disease. Based on preclinical studies, certain serotonin (5-HT) receptor ligands have been suggested to have the ability to modify or improve memory/cognition, specifically 5-HT receptors acting at 5-HT1A, 5-HT4 and 5-HT6 receptors. This article summarizes the pharmacology, efficacy, safety and tolerability data for the various serotonergic agents currently in clinical development for AD.  
24574501	Asymmetry and heterogeneity of Alzheimer's and frontotemporal pathology in primary progressive aphasia.
Brain 20140225 2014Apr
Fifty-eight autopsies of patients with primary progressive aphasia are reported. Twenty-three of these were previously described (Mesulam et al., 2008) but had their neuropathological diagnoses updated to fit current criteria. Thirty-five of the cases are new. Their clinical classification was guided as closely as possible by the 2011 consensus guidelines (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011). Tissue diagnoses included Alzheimer's disease in 45% and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in the others, with an approximately equal split between TAR DNA binding protein 43 proteinopathies and tauopathies. The most common and distinctive feature for all pathologies associated with primary progressive aphasia was the asymmetric prominence of atrophy, neuronal loss, and disease-specific proteinopathy in the language-dominant (mostly left) hemisphere. The Alzheimer's disease pathology in primary progressive aphasia displayed multiple atypical features. Males tended to predominate, the neurofibrillary pathology was more intense in the language-dominant hemisphere, the Braak pattern of hippocampo-entorhinal prominence was tilted in favour of the neocortex, and the APOE e4 allele was not a risk factor. Mean onset age was under 65 in the FTLD as well as Alzheimer's disease groups. The FTLD-TAR DNA binding protein 43 group had the youngest onset and fastest progression whereas the Alzheimer's disease and FTLD-tau groups did not differ from each other in either onset age or progression rate. Each cellular pathology type had a preferred but not invariant clinical presentation. The most common aphasic manifestation was of the logopenic type for Alzheimer pathology and of the agrammatic type for FTLD-tau. The progressive supranuclear palsy subtype of FTLD-tau consistently caused prominent speech abnormality together with agrammatism whereas FTLD-TAR DNA binding protein 43 of type C consistently led to semantic primary progressive aphasia. The presence of agrammatism made Alzheimer's disease pathology very unlikely whereas the presence of a logopenic aphasia or word comprehension impairment made FTLD-tau unlikely. The association of logopenic primary progressive aphasia with Alzheimer's disease pathology was much more modest than has been implied by results of in vivo amyloid imaging studies. Individual features of the aphasia, such as agrammatism and comprehension impairment, were as informative of underlying pathology as more laborious subtype diagnoses. At the single patient level, no clinical pattern was pathognomonic of a specific neuropathology type, highlighting the critical role of biomarkers for diagnosing the underlying disease. During clinical subtyping, some patients were unclassifiable by the 2011 guidelines whereas others simultaneously fit two subtypes. Revisions of criteria for logopenic primary progressive aphasia are proposed to address these challenges.  
24578544	Compensatory mechanisms in higher-educated subjects with Alzheimer's disease: a study of 20 years of cognitive decline.
Brain 20140227 2014Apr
A better knowledge of long-term trajectories of cognitive decline is a central feature of the study of the process leading to Alzheimer's dementia. Several factors may mitigate such decline, among which is education, a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The aim of our work was to compare the pattern and duration of clinical trajectories before Alzheimer's dementia in individuals with low and high education within the PAQUID cohort involving 20 years of follow-up. The sample comprises 442 participants with incident Alzheimer's disease (27.2% were male)--171 with low education (mean age=86.2 years; standard deviation=5.3 years) and 271 with higher education (mean age=86.5; standard deviation=5.4)--and 442 control subjects matched according to age, sex and education. At each visit and up to the 20-year follow-up visit, several cognitive and clinical measures were collected and incident cases of Alzheimer's disease clinically diagnosed. The evolution of clinical measures in pre-demented subjects and matched controls was analysed with a semi-parametric extension of the mixed effects linear model. The results show that the first signs of cognitive decline occurred 15 to 16 years before achieving dementia threshold in higher-educated subjects whereas signs occurred at 7 years before dementia in low-educated subjects. There seemed to be two successive periods of decline in higher-educated subjects. Decline started âˆ¼15 to 16 years before dementia with subtle impairment restricted to some cognitive tests and with no impact during the first 7 to 8 years on global cognition, cognitive complaints, or activities of daily living scales. Then, âˆ¼7 years before dementia, global cognitive abilities begin to deteriorate, along with difficulties dealing with complex activities of daily living, the increase in self-perceived difficulties and depressive symptoms. By contrast, lower-educated subjects presented a single period of decline lasting âˆ¼7 years, characterized by decline concomitantly affecting specific and more global cognitive function along with alteration in functional abilities. This study demonstrates how early cognitive symptoms may emerge preceding Alzheimer's dementia particularly in higher-educated individuals, for whom decline occurred up to 16 years before dementia. It also demonstrates the protective role of education in the clinical trajectory preceding Alzheimer's dementia. We suggest that the initial decline in cognition occurs at the onset of comparable Alzheimer's disease pathology in both groups, and is associated with immediate decline to dementia in the lower education group. In contrast, higher education protects against further cognitive decline for âˆ¼7 years until pathology becomes more severe. 
24656258	Intrinsic connectivity identifies the hippocampus as a main crossroad between Alzheimer's and semantic dementia-targeted networks.
Neuron  2014Mar19
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and semantic dementia (SD) are both characterized by severe atrophy in the hippocampus, a brain region underlying episodic memory; paradoxically, episodic memory is relatively preserved in SD. Here, we used intrinsic connectivity analyses and showed that the brain networks differentially vulnerable to each disease converge to the hippocampus in the healthy brain. As neurodegeneration is thought to spread within preexisting networks, the common hippocampal atrophy in both diseases is likely due to its location at the crossroad between both vulnerable networks. Yet, we showed that in the normal brain, these networks harbor different functions, with episodic memory relying on the AD-vulnerable network only. Overall, disease-associated cognitive deficits seem to reflect the disruption of targeted networks more than atrophy in specific brain regions: in AD, over hippocampal atrophy, episodic memory deficits are likely due to disconnection within a memory-related network.  
24475827	Mapping the effect of the apolipoprotein E genotype on 4-year atrophy rates in an Alzheimer disease-related brain network.
Radiology 20131212 2014Apr
To determine the effect of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on atrophy rates of specific brain gray matter regions hypothesized to be key components of cognitive networks disrupted in Alzheimer disease. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating sites. All subjects and their legal representatives gave written informed consent prior to data collection. The authors analyzed data from 237 subjects (mean age, 79.9 years; 40% female) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the ADNI database and assessed the effect of the APOE Îµ4 and Îµ2 alleles on regional brain atrophy rates over a 12-48-month period. Brain regions were selected a priori: 15 experimental and five control regions were included. Regional atrophy rates were derived by using a fully automated algorithm applied to T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data. Analysis consisted of mixed-effects linear regression with repeated measures; results were adjusted for multiple testing with Bonferroni correction. Thirteen of 15 experimental regions showed a significant effect of Îµ4 for higher atrophy rates (P &lt; .001 for all). Cohen d values ranged from 0.26 to 0.42, with the largest effects seen in the amygdalae and hippocampi. The transverse temporal cortex showed a trend (P = .02, but did not survive Bonferroni correction) for a protective effect (Cohen d value = 0.15) of Îµ2. No control region showed an APOE effect. The APOE Îµ4 allele is associated with accelerated rates of atrophy in 13 distinct brain regions in limbic and neocortical areas. This suggests the possibility of a genotype-specific network of related brain regions that undergo faster atrophy in MCI and potentially contribute to cognitive decline. Online supplemental material is available for this article. 
24418409	Alzheimer disease therapeutics: focus on the disease and not just plaques and tangles.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140110 2014Apr15
The bulk of AD research during the last 25 years has been AÎ²-centric based on a strong faith in the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis which is not supported by the data on humans. To date, AÎ²-based therapeutic clinical trials on sporadic cases of AD have been negative. Although most likely the major reason for the failure is that AÎ² is not an effective therapeutic target for sporadic AD, initiation of the treatment at mild to moderate stages of the disease is blamed as too late to be effective. Clinical trials on presymptomatic familial AD cases have been initiated with the logic that AÎ² is a trigger of the disease and hence initiation of the AÎ² immunotherapies several years before any clinical symptoms would be effective. There is an urgent need to explore targets other than AÎ². There is now increasing interest in inhibiting tau pathology, which does have a far more compelling rationale than AÎ². AD is multifactorial and over 99% of the cases are the sporadic form of the disease. Understanding of the various etiopathogenic mechanisms of sporadic AD and generation of the disease-relevant animal models are required to develop rational therapeutic targets and therapies. Treatment of AD will require both inhibition of neurodegeneration and regeneration of the brain.  
23713775	Inhibition of amyloid-Î² aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr. Pharm. Des.  2014
The assembly of naturally occurring amyloid peptides into cytotoxic oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates is believed to be a major pathologic event in over 25 human diseases. Blocking of or interfering with the aggregation of amyloid peptides such as amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) using small organic molecules, peptides and peptidomimetics, and nanoparticles that selectively bind or inhibit AÎ² aggregates is a promising strategy for the development of novel pharmaceutical approaches and agents to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a broad sense, considering many common features in structure, kinetics, and biological activity of amyloid peptides, potent inhibitors and associated inhibition strategies that are developed for targeting AÎ² aggregation could also be generally applied to other amyloid-forming peptides in "protein-aggregation diseases". Due to the complex nature of AÎ² self-assembly process, increasing knowledge in high-resolution structures of AÎ² oligomers, atomic-level AÎ²-inhibitor binding information, and cost-effective high-throughput screening method will improve our fundamental understanding of amyloid formation and inhibition mechanisms, as well as practical design of pharmaceutical strategies and drugs to treat AD. This review summarizes major findings, recent advances, and future challenges for the development of new AÎ²-aggregation inhibitors, mainly focusing on three major classes of AÎ² inhibitors with associated inhibition mechanisms and practical. examples.  
24697817	Assessment of type I error rate associated with dose-group switching in a longitudinal Alzheimer trial.
J Biopharm Stat  2014
In clinical trials, there always is the possibility to use data-driven adaptation at the end of a study. There prevails, however, concern on whether the type I error rate of the trial could be inflated with such design, thus, necessitating multiplicity adjustment. In this project, a simulation experiment was set up to assess type I error rate inflation associated with switching dose group as a function of dropout rate at the end of the study, where the primary analysis is in terms of a longitudinal outcome. This simulation is inspired by a clinical trial in Alzheimer's disease. The type I error rate was assessed under a number of scenarios, in terms of differing correlations between efficacy and tolerance, different missingness mechanisms, and different probabilities of switching. A collection of parameter values was used to assess sensitivity of the analysis. Results from ignorable likelihood analysis show that the type I error rate with and without switching was approximately the posited error rate for the various scenarios. Under last observation carried forward (LOCF), the type I error rate blew up both with and without switching. The type I error inflation is clearly connected to the criterion used for switching. While in general switching, in a way related to the primary endpoint, may impact the type I error, this was not the case for most scenarios in the longitudinal Alzheimer trial setting under consideration, where patients are expected to worsen over time.  
24327420	Alternative approaches for PET radiotracer development in Alzheimer's disease: imaging beyond plaque.
J Labelled Comp Radiopharm 20131211 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias show increasing clinical prevalence, yet our understanding of the etiology and pathobiology of disease-related neurodegeneration remains limited. In this regard, noninvasive imaging with radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) presents a unique tool for quantifying spatial and temporal changes in characteristic biological markers of brain disease and for assessing potential drug efficacy. PET radiotracers targeting different protein markers are being developed to address questions pertaining to the molecular and/or genetic heterogeneity of AD and related dementias. For example, radiotracers including [(11) C]-PiB and [(18) F]-AV-45 (Florbetapir) are being used to measure the density of AÎ²-plaques in AD patients and to interrogate the biological mechanisms of disease initiation and progression. Our focus is on the development of novel PET imaging agents, targeting proteins beyond AÎ²-plaques, which can be used to investigate the broader mechanism of AD pathogenesis. Here, we present the chemical basis of various radiotracers which show promise in preclinical or clinical studies for use in evaluating the phenotypic or biochemical characteristics of AD. Radiotracers for PET imaging neuroinflammation, metal ion association with AÎ²-plaques, tau protein, cholinergic and cannabinoid receptors, and enzymes including glycogen-synthase kinase-3Î² and monoamine oxidase B amongst others, and their connection to AD are highlighted. 
24783773	The hematopoietic growth factor "erythropoietin" enhances the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells in Alzheimer's disease.
Pak. J. Biol. Sci.  2014Jan1
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by cognitive dysfunction and by deposition of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The study investigated the therapeutic effect of combined mesenchymal stem cells and erythropoietin on Alzheimer's disease. Five groups of mice were used: control group, Alzheimer's disease was induced in four groups by a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.8 mg kg(-1) lipopolysaccharide and divided as follows: Alzheimer's disease group, mesenchymal stem cells treated group by injecting mesenchymal stem cells into the tail vein (2 x 10(6) cells), erythropoietin treated group (40 microg kg(-1) b.wt.) injected intraperitoneally 3 times/week for 5 weeks and mesenchymal stem cells and erythropoietin treated group. Locomotor activity and memory were tested using open field and Y-maze. Histological, histochemical, immunohistochemical studies, morphometric measurements were examined in brain sections of all groups. Choline transferase activity, brain derived neurotrophic factor expression and mitochondrial swellings were assessed in cerebral specimens. Lipopolysaccharide decreased locomotor activity, memory, choline transferase activity and brain derived neurotrophic factor. It increased mitochondrial swelling, apoptotic index and amyloid deposition. Combined mesenchymal stem cells and erythropoietin markedly improved all these parameters. This study proved the effective role of mesenchymal stem cells in relieving Alzheimer's disease symptoms and manifestations; it highlighted the important role of erythropoietin in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
24572336	Assessing THK523 selectivity for tau deposits in Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease tauopathies.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140226 2014
The introduction of tau imaging agents such as (18)F-THK523 offers new hope for the in vivo assessment of tau deposition in tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where preliminary (18)F-THK523-PET studies have demonstrated significantly higher cortical retention of (18)F-THK523 in AD compared to age-matched healthy individuals. In addition to AD, tau imaging with PET may also be of value in assessing non-AD tauopathies, such as corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Pick's disease (PiD). To further investigate the ability of THK523 to recognize tau lesions, we undertook immunohistochemical and fluorescence studies in serial brain sections taken from individuals with AD (nâ€‰=â€‰3), CBD (nâ€‰=â€‰2), PSP (nâ€‰=â€‰1), PiD (nâ€‰=â€‰2) and Parkinson's disease (PD; nâ€‰=â€‰2). In addition to the neuropathological analysis, one PSP patient had undergone a (18)F-THK523 PET scan 5Â months before death. Although THK523 labelled tau-containing lesions such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in the hippocampus and frontal regions of AD brains, it failed to label tau-containing lesions in non-AD tauopathies. Furthermore, though THK523 faintly labelled dense-cored amyloid-Î² plaques in the AD frontal cortex, it failed to label Î±-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies in PD brain sections. The results of this study suggest that (18)F-THK523 selectively binds to paired helical filament tau in AD brains but does not bind to tau lesions in non-AD tauopathies, or to Î±-synuclein in PD brains. 
24387311	Photobiomodulation with near infrared light mitigates Alzheimer's disease-related pathology in cerebral cortex - evidence from two transgenic mouse models.
Alzheimers Res Ther 20140103 2014
Previous work has demonstrated the efficacy of irradiating tissue with red to infrared light in mitigating cerebral pathology and degeneration in animal models of stroke, traumatic brain injury, parkinsonism and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using mouse models, we explored the neuroprotective effect of near infrared light (NIr) treatment, delivered at an age when substantial pathology is already present in the cerebral cortex. We studied two mouse models with AD-related pathologies: the K369I tau transgenic model (K3), engineered to develop neurofibrillary tangles, and the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic model (APP/PS1), engineered to develop amyloid plaques. Mice were treated with NIr 20 times over a four-week period and histochemistry was used to quantify AD-related pathological hallmarks and other markers of cell damage in the neocortex and hippocampus. In the K3 mice, NIr treatment was associated with a reduction in hyperphosphorylated tau, neurofibrillary tangles and oxidative stress markers (4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) to near wildtype levels in the neocortex and hippocampus, and with a restoration of expression of the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase in surviving neurons. In the APP/PS1 mice, NIr treatment was associated with a reduction in the size and number of amyloid-Î² plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus. Our results, in two transgenic mouse models, suggest that NIr may have potential as an effective, minimally-invasive intervention for mitigating, and even reversing, progressive cerebral degenerations. 
24647241	[From Arnold Pick's original descriptions to frontotemporal dementia: the present enlightened by the past an historical approach].
Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil  2014Mar
Since its seminal characterization, Pick's disease (PiD), was marked by a double ambiguity. Sometimes, with reference to original Pick's descriptions, PiD was macroscopically defined by a circumscribed frontotemporal cerebral atrophy, independently of its causes. Sometimes, on the other hand, it was histologically characterized by absence of Alzheimer pathology and considered as a special form of degenerative process. However, this special degenerative process was defined either by the particular topography of neuronal loss or by specific histological changes, which were described by Alzheimer. Therefore, individualization of PiD and its relationships with Alzheimer's disease have long been controversial, particularly in the United States, despite the clarification provided by French authors in the 1960s, Swiss authors in the 1970s and Swedish and English authors in the 1980s. The term of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was choosed by the last authors in 1994 to avoid the debates on the definition of PiD, and to characterize a particular degenerative process without Alzheimer pathology or other diseases. However, the definition and nature of FTD currently remain ambiguous because the term FTD is applied either to clinical syndromes with different presentations according to predominant frontal or temporal atrophy, and regardless of histologic pathology, or to a particular degenerative process, hereditary or sporadic. Notwithstanding neuropathologic and genetic advances in the last decades, significant challenges remain for FTD therapeutic research as a result of the degenerative processes complexity and lack of parallelism between clinical, neuropathological, and genetic data.  
24647244	[Impact of dysexecutive syndrome on autonomy in early Alzheimer's disease and Mild cognitive impairment].
Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil  2014Mar
Early impairment of the cognitive and behavioral executive processes are found in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as well as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These processes are strongly linked to autonomy in daily living because they are involved in our adaptation to many new situations. To evaluate the executive processes and their links with autonomy, we compared 20 control subjects to 20 patients with MCI, and 20 patients with early AD. All participants completed three executive cognitive task, according to the Miyake's model: set-shifting was assessed by the Trail Making Task, inhibition control by the Hayling test, and working memory by the Updating test. They also completed the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (Lars) evaluating four components of apathy. The autonomy, conceptualized as competency in four domains of daily-living, was evaluated by the Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS), completed by a close relative. Control subjects showed higher scores than both clinical groups on the TMT time completion. AD group showed a tendency to make more errors than the control subjects on Hayling test, whereas MCI group didn't differ from the other groups. No other group effect was found on the executive dependent variables. Both MCI and Alzheimer groups had higher scores of apathy than the control group on the Lars total score and its three components. Similar results were found on the PCRS and the Lars three subscales. The best predictors of autonomy were the TMT time completion and the total Lars score. Loss of competency is found in MCI as well as in AD and is correlate to set-shifting and apathy. 
24574548	Logopenic, mixed, or Alzheimer-related aphasia?
Neurology 20140226 2014Apr1
This study tested the hypothesis that patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) who do not meet the proposed criteria for any of the recognized subtypes would have the atrophy pattern reported in the past for logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA), in turn suggesting that the PPA of likely Alzheimer disease origin is more variable than that captured in the current lvPPA diagnostic recommendations. MRI gray matter volumes from 14 patients with mixed PPA who failed to meet the diagnostic recommendations for any recognized variant were compared with those of 25 matched control participants via voxel-based morphometry. The mixed PPA group had left temporoparietal atrophy with a pattern identical to that in previously reported lvPPA cohorts. Patients with PPA who did not meet the criteria for any recognized PPA variant at their initial assessment had the group-level atrophy pattern previously reported as the hallmark of lvPPA. We suggest that the specific language features proposed for lvPPA are too narrow to characterize the language impairments arising from likely Alzheimer pathology. 
24286919	Regenerative medicine in Alzheimer's disease.
Transl Res 20131108 2014Apr
Identifying novel, effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major unmet medical needs for the coming decade. Because the current paradigm for developing and testing disease-modifying AD therapies is protracted and likely to be even longer, with the shift toward earlier intervention in preclinical AD, it is an open issue whether we can develop, test, and widely deploy a novel therapy in time to help the current at-risk generation if we continue to follow the standard paradigms of discovery and drug development. There is an imperative need to find safe and effective preventive measures that can be distributed rapidly to stem the coming wave of AD that will potentially engulf the next generation. We can define regenerative medicine broadly as approaches that use stem cell-based therapies or approaches that seek to modulate inherent neurogenesis. Neurogenesis, although most active during prenatal development, has been shown to continue in several small parts of the brain, including the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, suggesting its potential to reverse cognitive deficits. If AD pathology affects neurogenesis, then it follows that conditions that stimulate endogenous neurogenesis (eg, environmental stimuli, physical activity, trophic factors, cytokines, and drugs) may help to promote the regenerative and recovery process. Herein, we review the complex logistics of potentially implementing neurogenesis-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD.  
24717737	Latino Alzheimer's disease caregivers and depression: using the stress coping model to examine the effects of spirituality and religion.
J Appl Gerontol 20120515 2014Apr
This study used stress coping theory to examine the effects of spirituality and religion on depression among a sample of Latino family members caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States. Participants consisted of 209 Latino caregivers (CGs) drawn from baseline data from the Resource for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregivers Health (REACH) II clinical trial. The findings indicate that church attendance moderates the relationship between subjective forms of stress and depression in tandem with exhibiting direct effects on depression. Consistent with the central role religion plays in Latino culture, the results imply that religious involvement may play an important role in mitigating depression through indirect and direct pathways.  
24059316	Proteomics approaches to understand linkage between Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease of the brain leading to the irreversible loss of neurons and intellectual abilities. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The prevalence of AD and T2DM is increasing at an alarming rate and has become a major public health concern worldwide. The clinico-pathological relationship between AD and T2DM has been debated for more than a decade. Recent epidemiological studies have provided direct evidence that T2DM is a strong risk factor for AD and numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing AD as compared with healthy individuals. The underlying biological mechanisms that link the development of diabetes with AD are not fully understood and therefore are worth intensive research. The existence of proteomic links between AD and diabetes is an important topic currently under active debate. An understanding of the complex association between diabetes and AD is necessary for the development of novel drug therapies and lifestyle guidelines aimed at the treatment and/or prevention of these diseases. This review aims to summarize what is currently known about the biological and especially proteomic relationships and similarities between these two age-related devastating diseases of modern day life. This study may also aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of potential blood-based protein biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD and T2DM with high sensitivity and specificity.  
24059313	Role of gut microbiota in obesity, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
In recent years, there is a growing interest in research to investigate the importance of gut microbiome in health and diseases. This opens a new area of research for the role of microbial flora of the human gut in inflammation, energy homeostasis, pathogenesis of obesity and other associated disorders. Recent studies propose association of the gut microbiome with development of obesity and metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The T2DM is a metabolic disease that is mainly caused by obesity-linked insulin resistance. The vascular effects of obesity appears to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is one of the rapidly growing diseases of a late stage of life all over the world. Studies from both humans and mice models have been demonstrated the engagement of gut microbial flora in the pathogenesis of obesity and host metabolism. The aim of this review is to discuss the current findings that may explain the cascade of gut microbial flora participation in the development of obesity, T2DM and further initiation of AD. In addition, the available data regarding the mechanisms that have been proposed to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in weight gain and possible cause of T2DM and AD have been examined.  
24059314	Autophagy dysfunction and its link to Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes mellitus.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
Epidemiological data testifies the increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Some associations were made between occidental lifestyle and development of these pathologies, moreover AD and T2DM are linked since each pathology is a causative risk factor for the other. Interestingly, autophagy, a catabolic pathway whose efficiency declines with age is importantly impaired in the affected tissues. Autophagy regulation is dependent of cell metabolic status and consequently on the 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. These pathways are altered with aging and molecular, pharmacological and physiological interventions increase lifespan in various organismal models and favours healthy aging diminishing the occurrence of age-related diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies. Decreasing calorie intake has been known for a long time to have a beneficial effect on longevity and health. Some drug agonists of AMPK are known to mimic these effects such as metformin or resveratrol, a polyphenol extracted from plants and present in red wine, a component of the French paradox related diet. In this review, we present the epidemiological and pathogenesis links existing between AD and T2DM with an insight into the perturbations of the autophagic process highlighting the crucial role of the AMPK in development of age and metabolic related diseases. Hence, in a last part we will discuss the possible interventions susceptible to combat both T2DM and AD.  
24059318	The role of neuronal insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: possible therapeutic implications.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
Recent data suggest that brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) resistant. So far, there have been two different approaches to investigate possible therapeutic implications of modulating cerebral insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) in AD. One approach is peripheral or intranasal administration of insulin or IGF-1. Intranasal and peripheral insulin administration has been shown to improve memory in patients with AD. Additionally, peripheral IGF-1 administration resulted in decreased amyloid-beta (AÎ²) levels in brains of AD mouse models accompanied by elevated AÎ² levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Insulin and IGF-1 regulate multicargotransporters influencing trafficking of several molecules including AÎ² from the brain to the blood as well as to the CSF and possibly vice versa. Furthermore, insulin and related peptides regulate neurovascular coupling changing regional blood flow. Thus, positive effects of peripheral insulin/IGF-1 administration on AD pathology might be due to changes in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and/or in the transport between the CSF/blood and the brain. Clinical and experimental data suggest that increased serum insulin and IGF-1 levels do not necessarily correlate with an upregulation of neuronal insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling. Therefore, the second approach in investigating the role of neuronal IIS for the pathogenesis of AD analyzes knockout mice lacking components of the IIS in AD models. Haploinsufficiency of the IGF- 1 receptor (IGF-1R) (IGF-1R(+/-) mice) as well as neuronal deficiency of the insulin receptor (IR) (nIR(-/-) mice) or IGF-1R (nIGF-1R(-/-) mice) leads to delayed AÎ² accumulation when crossed with mouse models for AD. Furthermore, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 knockout mice (IRS-2(-/-) mice) show reduced AÎ² levels in an Alzheimer background. These data suggest beneficial effects of decreased neuronal IIS on Alzheimer-pathology and question the therapeutic outcome of long-term administration of insulin or IGF-1 in patients with AD. Whether the observed phenomenon of cerebral insulin and IGF-1 resistance even at an early stage of Alzheimer's disease is cause, consequence or possibly counter-regulation to AD-pathology needs further investigation and should lead to critical discussions. The current review discusses the pros and cons of targeting insulin/IGF-1 signaling as therapeutic approach for AD.  
24059319	Genomic linkage between Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major health concern that affects nearly every society worldwide. The disease is an irreversible, progressive and age-related neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by impaired cognitive function and the diffuse deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The causes of AD and the underlying mechanisms that trigger the onset of the disease are still a matter of debate. Several epidemiological studies have shown that the development of AD is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). In this review, we provide evidence for the link between T2D and AD, highlighting the critical role of insulin in the pathogenesis of these diseases, and we provide information on the genes that might be involved in the interplay between these two disorders. New insight into the complex biology of AD is necessary for the early diagnosis of the disease, the development of novel drug therapies and the prevention of these health issues.  
24059320	Insulin-degrading enzyme: a link between Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
Enzymes play a very vital role in maintaining the homeostasis inside the body. Improper functioning of enzymes is associated with many diseases. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a ubiquitously expressed zinc metalloprotease, is believed to act as a junction point of Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies provide inkling for the use of IDE as a potential target hence the design of its regulators would be a viable approach towards treatment of these diseases. This review provides an overview of the IDE structure and function; a relationship is drawn between IDE, Type 2 Diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease and the approaches that make IDE a potential target, are discussed.  
24059321	Common cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes: a knowledge-driven approach.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
The relationship between the two age-related diseases namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is gaining much attention in research because of the alarming forecast on both increasing incidence and economic burden. Recent research studies have identified some of the existing links, between AD and T2DM, such as the dysfunctional glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, stress and inflammation, defective protein processing and the role of advanced glycation end products. It is, therefore, crucial to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms to identify the common linking mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of both AD and T2DM. Genome wide association studies may lead to identification of novel targets and provide clues for possible interventional strategies to limit the progression of these two age-related diseases. Hence, the purpose of the present review is to provide an update, on the various possible linking cellular and molecular mechanisms, including our experience on the use of high throughput applications to investigate the molecular mechanisms underneath the neurodegeneration in animal models. Besides, using this knowledge-driven approach, we discuss how the current technological advancements can effectively be used to identify possible associations between these age-related diseases.  
24059323	Molecular linkages between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease: current scenario and future prospects.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
After the revolutionary Rotterdam study that suggested there was an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a number of studies have provided direct evidence for the linkage between AD and T2DM. In recent years, AD is considered as a neuroendocrine disorder, also referred as type-3 diabetes. There is a growing list of evidence to suggest that, in addition to impaired insulin signaling, there are a number of additional factors that may act as mechanistic links between AD and T2DM. These factors mainly include hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, hypercystinemia, inflammation, impaired insulin signaling and impaired central nervous response to the adipose tissue-derived hormone leptin. Increased cholesterol plays a crucial role in the abnormal metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein, leading to the accumulation of Î²-amyloid. In addition to impaired insulin signaling, diabetes has been found to accelerate the appearance of cerebrovascular inflammation and Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²) deposition. Increased oxidative stress and production of advanced glycation end products are other probable marker linkages. However, the details of many of these molecular links still require extensive investigation. It is possible that a number of common molecular linkages exist between T2DM and AD. Understanding and analyzing the various molecular linkages between AD and T2DM may shed light on new tools that can be used for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD and also accelerate the identification of T2DM patients who are at high risk of AD.  
24059324	Fighting Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes: pathological links and treatment strategies.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with associated serious complications continues to grow rapidly especially in developed countries. Emerging evidence indicates that AD and T2DM share some common risk factors with comparable pathological features including insulin resistance, amyloidogenesis, glucocorticoid imbalance, inflammation, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. T2DM has been identified as a risk factor for AD. It has even been hypothesized that AD might be "type 3 diabetes". In addition to amyloid precursor protein processing and tau phosphorylation, commonalities between T2DM and AD in molecular mechanisms provide clues to the identification of novel therapeutic targets such as glucagon-like peptide 1, butyrylcholinesterase, and receptor for advanced glycosylation end products. Although several classes of anti-diabetic drugs are available, achieving long-term glycaemic control without side effects is often challenging. This review summarizes recent evidence for the pathological links, common therapeutic targets, currently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved and potential future therapies, giving special attention to ongoing clinical trials of antidiabetic drugs in AD patients and common therapeutic strategies in the management of both AD and T2DM.  
24059325	A molecular bridge: connecting type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are complex diseases commonly associated with aging. Accumulating evidence indicates a connection between these two diseases at the molecular level. Much of what we currently know about T2D and AD is derived from in vivo and in vitro studies. However, further research and characterization of molecules is necessary to establish a strong connection between T2D and AD. In silico studies play a major role in finding non-evident patterns of gene expression and gene network connectivity. In this review, we give a brief introduction to T2D and AD and then describe the risk factors and molecules that are commonly associated with these diseases. Finally, we discuss the future directions and applications of bioinformatics that can provide greater insight into the relationship between these two diseases. Analysis and integration of high-throughput data on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics from normal and disease tissues would be very useful to improve our understanding of the mechanism behind disease initiation and the connection between these two diseases. We encourage researchers to use bioinformatics approaches to identify genes and their regulatory pathways that are commonly affected in T2D and AD, as these genes and pathways could be potential biomarkers and targets for disease treatment.  
24074446	Epigenomic approach in understanding Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
Cognitive decline is a debilitating feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The causes leading to such impairment are still poorly understood and effective treatments for AD are still unavailable. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been identified as a risk factor for AD due to desensitisation of insulin receptors in the brain. Recent studies have suggested that epigenetic mechanisms may also play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both AD and T2DM. This article describes the correlation between AD and T2DM and provides the insights to the epigenetics of AD. Currently, more research is needed to clarify the exact role of epigenetic regulation in the course and development of AD and also in relation to insulin. Research conducted especially in the earlier stages of the disease could provide more insight into its underlying pathophysiology to help in early diagnosis and the development of more effective treatment strategies.  
24074448	Linking Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus via aberrant insulin signaling and inflammation.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two progressive and devastating health disorders afflicting millions of people worldwide. The probability and incidence of both have increased considerably in recent years consequent to increased longevity and population growth. Progressively more links are being continuously found between inflammation and central nervous system disorders like AD, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury and even cancers of the nervous tissue. The depth of the relationship depends on the timing and extent of anti- or pro-inflammatory gene expression. Inflammation has also been implicated in T2DM. Misfolding and fibrillization (of tissue specific and/or non-specific proteins) are features common to both AD and T2DM and are induced by as well as contribute to inflammation and stress (oxidative/ glycation). This review appraises the roles of inflammation and abnormalities in the insulin signaling system as important shared features of T2DM and AD. The capacity of anti-cholinesterases in reducing the level of certain common inflammatory markers in particular if they may provide therapeutic potential to mitigate awry mechanisms leading to AD.  
24656814	Detection of misfolded AÎ² oligomers for sensitive biochemical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
Cell Rep 20140320 2014Apr10
Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is hampered by the lack of early, sensitive, and objective laboratory tests. We describe a sensitive method for biochemical diagnosis of AD based on specific detection of misfolded AÎ² oligomers, which play a central role in AD pathogenesis. The protein misfolding cyclic amplification assay (AÎ²-PMCA), exploits the functional property of AÎ² oligomers to seed the polymerization of monomeric AÎ². AÎ²-PMCA allowed detection of as little as 3 fmol of AÎ² oligomers. Most importantly, using cerebrospinal fluid, we were able to distinguish AD patients from control individuals affected by a variety of other neurodegenerative disorders or nondegenerative neurological diseases with overall sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 92%. These findings provide the proof-of-principle basis for developing a highly sensitive and specific biochemical test for AD diagnosis.  
24729341	Mutations in the exon 7 of Trp53 gene and the level of p53 protein in double transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Folia Neuropathol  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to generation of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) in the brain. Alzheimer's disease model PS/APP mice show a markedly accelerated accumulation of AÎ², which may lead to apoptosis induction e.g. in cells expressing wild-type p53. The TP53 gene is found to be the most frequently mutated gene in human tumour cells. There is accumulating evidence pointing out to the contribution of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in both AD and cancer. The purpose of this study was to analyze exon 7 mutations of the murine Trp53 gene and AÎ²/A4 and p53 protein levels in PS/APP and control mice. The studies were performed on female double transgenic PS/APP mice and young adults (8-12 weeks old) and age-matched control mice. The Trp53 mutation analysis was carried out with the use of PCR and DNA sequencing. The AÎ²/A4 and p53 levels were analyzed by Western blotting. The frequency of mutations was almost quadrupled in PS/APP mice (44%), compared to controls (14%). PS/APP mice with the A929T and A857G mutations had a similar p53 level. In cerebral gray matter of PS/APP mice the level of p53 positive correlated with the level of AÎ² protein (RS = +0.700, p &lt; 0.05). In younger control animals, the T854G mutation was related to p53 down-regulation, while in aging ones, G859A substitution was most likely associated with over-expression of p53. In silico protein analysis revealed a possibly substantial impact of all four mutations on p53 activity. Three mutations were in close proximity to zinc-coordinating cysteine residues. It seems that in PS/APP mice missense Trp53 exon 7 mutations may be associated with the degenerative process by changes of p53 protein function.  
23954108	Population-based analysis of Alzheimer's disease risk alleles implicates genetic interactions.
Biol. Psychiatry 20130813 2014May1
Reported odds ratios and population attributable fractions (PAF) for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk loci (BIN1, ABCA7, CR1, MS4A4E, CD2AP, PICALM, MS4A6A, CD33, and CLU) come from clinically ascertained samples. Little is known about the combined PAF for these LOAD risk alleles and the utility of these combined markers for case-control prediction. Here we evaluate these loci in a large population-based sample to estimate PAF and explore the effects of additive and nonadditive interactions on LOAD status prediction performance. 2419 samples from the Cache County Memory Study were genotyped for APOE and nine LOAD risk loci from AlzGene.org. We used logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic analysis to assess the LOAD status prediction performance of these loci using additive and nonadditive models and compared odds ratios and PAFs between AlzGene.org and Cache County. Odds ratios were comparable between Cache County and AlzGene.org when identical single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped. PAFs from AlzGene.org ranged from 2.25% to 37%; those from Cache County ranged from .05% to 20%. Including non-APOE alleles significantly improved LOAD status prediction performance (area under the curve = .80) over APOE alone (area under the curve = .78) when not constrained to an additive relationship (p &lt; .03). We identified potential allelic interactions (p values uncorrected): CD33-MS4A4E (synergy factor = 5.31; p &lt; .003) and CLU-MS4A4E (synergy factor = 3.81; p &lt; .016). Although nonadditive interactions between loci significantly improve diagnostic ability, the improvement does not reach the desired sensitivity or specificity for clinical use. Nevertheless, these results suggest that understanding gene-gene interactions may be important in resolving Alzheimer's disease etiology. 
24074637	Benzoate, a D-amino acid oxidase inhibitor, for the treatment of early-phase Alzheimer disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
Biol. Psychiatry 20130925 2014May1
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission is vital for learning and memory. Hypofunction of NMDAR has been reported to play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD), particularly in the early phase. Enhancing NMDAR activation might be a novel treatment approach. One of the methods to enhance NMDAR activity is to raise the levels of NMDA coagonists by blocking their metabolism. This study examined the efficacy and safety of sodium benzoate, a D-amino acid oxidase inhibitor, for the treatment of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild AD. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in four major medical centers in Taiwan. Sixty patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild AD were treated with 250-750 mg/day of sodium benzoate or placebo for 24 weeks. Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (the primary outcome) and global function (assessed by Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input) were measured every 8 weeks. Additional cognition composite was measured at baseline and endpoint. Sodium benzoate produced a better improvement than placebo in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (p = .0021, .0116, and .0031 at week 16, week 24, and endpoint, respectively), additional cognition composite (p = .007 at endpoint) and Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (p = .015, .016, and .012 at week 16, week 24, and endpoint, respectively). Sodium benzoate was well-tolerated without evident side-effects. Sodium benzoate substantially improved cognitive and overall functions in patients with early-phase AD. The preliminary results show promise for D-amino acid oxidase inhibition as a novel approach for early dementing processes. 
24548642	Phosphorylated tau-AÎ²42 ratio as a continuous trait for biomarker discovery for early-stage Alzheimer's disease in multiplex immunoassay panels of cerebrospinal fluid.
Biol. Psychiatry 20140119 2014May1
Identification of the physiologic changes that occur during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may provide critical insights for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are a rich source of information that reflect the brain proteome. A novel approach was applied to screen a panel of ~190 CSF analytes quantified by multiplex immunoassay, and common associations were detected in the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (N = 311) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (N = 293) cohorts. Rather than case-control status, the ratio of CSF levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau181) and AÎ²42 was used as a continuous trait in these analyses. The ptau181-AÎ²42 ratio has more statistical power than traditional modeling approaches, and the levels of CSF heart-type fatty acid binding protein (FABP) and 12 other correlated analytes increase as AD progresses. These results were validated using the traditional case-control status model. Stratification of the dataset demonstrated that increases in these analytes occur very early in the disease course and were apparent even in nondemented individuals with AD pathology (low ptau181, low AÎ²42) compared with elderly control subjects with no pathology (low ptau181, high AÎ²42). The FABP-AÎ²42 ratio demonstrates a similar hazard ratio for disease conversion to ptau181-AÎ²42 even though the overlap in classification is incomplete suggesting that FABP contributes independent information as a predictor of AD. Our results indicate that the approach presented here can be used to identify novel biomarkers for AD correctly and that CSF heart FABP levels start to increase at very early stages of AD. 
23836416	Therapeutic strategies to prevent Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis using a fluorescent conjugated polyelectrolyte.
Macromol Biosci 20130708 2014Apr
Toxic metals accumulation in brain has a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by accelerating amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptide aggregation. AÎ² has high affinity for iron and copper resulting in the generation of neurotoxic hydrogen peroxide, oxidative stress and free radical formation. Water-soluble conjugated polyfluorene derivative poly(9,9-bis(6-sulphate hexyl) fluorene-alt-1,4-phenylene) sodium salt (P1) binds Fe(3+) heme proteins selectively in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), including ferritin in the AÎ² fibrils and diminishes their accumulation. Hence, therapeutic strategies involving clearance of AÎ² from brain plaques, metal removal, structurally modifying the aggregates, and preventing them from aggregating again into toxic polypeptides are vital strategies to control AD pathogenesis. 
24574084	Advances in longitudinal studies of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease based on multi-modal MRI techniques.
Neurosci Bull 20140227 2014Apr
Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 75%-80% of aMCI patients finally develop AD. So, early identification of patients with aMCI or AD is of great significance for prevention and intervention. According to cross-sectional studies, it is known that the hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, and corpus callosum are key areas in studies based on structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) respectively. Recently, longitudinal studies using each MRI modality have demonstrated that the neuroimaging abnormalities generally involve the posterior brain regions at the very beginning and then gradually affect the anterior areas during the progression of aMCI to AD. However, it is not known whether follow-up studies based on multi-modal neuroimaging techniques (e.g., sMRI, fMRI, and DTI) can help build effective MRI models that can be directly applied to the screening and diagnosis of aMCI and AD. Thus, in the future, large-scale multi-center follow-up studies are urgently needed, not only to build an MRI diagnostic model that can be used on a single person, but also to evaluate the variability and stability of the model in the general population. In this review, we present longitudinal studies using each MRI modality separately, and then discuss the future directions in this field. 
24604632	MiR-206 decreases brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140306 2014Apr
MicroRNA alterations have been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD mouse models. We now report that miR-206 is upregulated in the hippocampal tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma of embryonic APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The increased miR-206 downregulates the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is neuroprotective against cell death after various insults, but in embryonic and newborn APP/PS1 mice it is decreased. Thus, a specific microRNA alteration may contribute to AD pathology by downregulating BDNF. 
24610177	Dysfunctional autophagy in Alzheimer's disease: pathogenic roles and therapeutic implications.
Neurosci Bull 20140307 2014Apr
Neuronal autophagy is essential for neuronal survival and the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis. Increasing evidence has implicated autophagic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanisms underlying autophagic failure in AD involve several steps, from autophagosome formation to degradation. The effect of modulating autophagy is context-dependent. Stimulation of autophagy is not always beneficial. During the implementation of therapies that modulate autophagy, the nature of the autophagic defect, the timing of intervention, and the optimal level and duration of modulation should be fully considered. 
24627329	Tau hyperphosphorylation induces apoptotic escape and triggers neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140314 2014Apr
Since abnormal post-translational modifications or gene mutations of tau have been detected in over twenty neurodegenerative disorders, tau has attracted widespread interest as a target protein. Among its various post-translational modifications, phosphorylation is the most extensively studied. It is recognized that tau hyperphosphorylation is the root cause of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it is not clear how it causes neurodegeneration. Based on the findings that tau hyperphosphorylation leads to the escape of neurons from acute apoptosis and simultaneously impairs the function of neurons, we have proposed that the nature of AD neurodegeneration is the consequence of aborted apoptosis induced by tau phosphorylation. Therefore, proper manipulation of tau hyperphosphorylation could be promising for arresting AD neurodegeneration. In this review, the neuroprotective and neurodegenerative effects of tau hyperphosphorylation and our thoughts regarding their relationship are presented. 
24652456	Deregulation of brain insulin signaling in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140320 2014Apr
Contrary to the previous belief that insulin does not act in the brain, studies in the last three decades have demonstrated important roles of insulin and insulin signal transduction in various functions of the central nervous system. Deregulated brain insulin signaling and its role in molecular pathogenesis have recently been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this article, we review the roles of brain insulin signaling in memory and cognition, the metabolism of amyloid Î² precursor protein, and tau phosphorylation. We further discuss deficiencies of brain insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, their roles in the development of AD, and recent studies that target the brain insulin signaling pathway for the treatment of AD. It is clear now that deregulation of brain insulin signaling plays an important role in the development of sporadic AD. The brain insulin signaling pathway also offers a promising therapeutic target for treating AD and probably other neurodegenerative disorders. 
24652457	Apolipoprotein E, amyloid-beta, and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140320 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) peptides in the brain. Neuroinflammation occurs in the AD brain and plays a critical role in the neurodegenerative pathology. Particularly, AÎ² evokes an inflammatory response that leads to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and neurodegeneration. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) proteins are involved in cholesterol transport, AÎ² binding and clearance, and synaptic functions in the brain. The ApoE4 isoform is a key risk factor for AD, while the ApoE2 isoform has a neuroprotective effect. However, studies have reached different conclusions about the roles of the isoforms; some show that both ApoE3 and ApoE4 have anti-inflammatory effects, while others show that ApoE4 causes a predisposition to inflammation or promotes an inflammatory response following lipopolysaccharide treatment. These discrepancies may result from the differences in models, cell types, experimental conditions, and inflammatory stimuli used. Further, little was known about the role of ApoE isoforms in the AÎ²-induced inflammatory response and in the neuroinflammation of AD. Our recent work showed that ApoE isoforms differentially regulate and modify the AÎ²-induced inflammatory response in neural cells, with ApoE2 suppressing and ApoE4 promoting the response. In this article, we review the roles, mechanisms, and interrelations among AÎ², ApoE, and neuroinflammation in AD. 
24664866	Oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140324 2014Apr
Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating disease of the elderly. The brain is more vulnerable than other organs to oxidative stress, and most of the components of neurons (lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) can be oxidized in AD due to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased metal levels, inflammation, and Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) peptides. Oxidative stress participates in the development of AD by promoting AÎ² deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and the subsequent loss of synapses and neurons. The relationship between oxidative stress and AD suggests that oxidative stress is an essential part of the pathological process, and antioxidants may be useful for AD treatment. 
24664867	Environmental factors in the development and progression of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140324 2014Apr
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by gradual loss of synapses and neurons, but its pathogenesis remains to be clarified. Neurons live in an environment constituted by neurons themselves and glial cells. In this review, we propose that the neuronal degeneration in the AD brain is partially caused by diverse environmental factors. We first discuss various environmental stresses and the corresponding responses at different levels. Then we propose some mechanisms underlying the specific pathological changes, in particular, hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis dysfunction at the systemic level; cerebrovascular dysfunction, metal toxicity, glial activation, and AÎ² toxicity at the intercellular level; and kinase-phosphatase imbalance and epigenetic modification at the intracellular level. Finally, we discuss the possibility of developing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of LOAD from the perspective of environmental stress. We conclude that environmental factors play a significant role in the development of LOAD through multiple pathological mechanisms. 
24733652	Disrupted structural and functional brain connectomes in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140415 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, comprising an estimated 60-80% of all dementia cases. It is clinically characterized by impairments of memory and other cognitive functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that these impairments are associated with abnormal structural and functional connections among brain regions, leading to a disconnection concept of AD. With the advent of a combination of non-invasive neuroimaging (structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, and functional MRI) and neurophysiological techniques (electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography) with graph theoretical analysis, recent studies have shown that patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the prodromal stage of AD, exhibit disrupted topological organization in large-scale brain networks (i.e., connectomics) and that this disruption is significantly correlated with the decline of cognitive functions. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of brain connectomics in AD and MCI, focusing on the changes in the topological organization of large-scale structural and functional brain networks using graph theoretical approaches. Based on the two different perspectives of information segregation and integration, the literature reviewed here suggests that AD and MCI are associated with disrupted segregation and integration in brain networks. Thus, these connectomics studies open up a new window for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD and demonstrate the potential to uncover imaging biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation for this disease. 
24733653	Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140415 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that takes about a decade to develop, making early diagnosis possible. Clinically, the diagnosis of AD is complicated, costly, and inaccurate, so it is urgent to find specific biomarkers. Due to its multifactorial nature, a panel of biomarkers for the multiple pathologies of AD, such as cerebral amyloidogenesis, neuronal dysfunction, synapse loss, oxidative stress, and inflammation, are most promising for accurate diagnosis. Highly sensitive and high-throughput proteomic techniques can be applied to develop a panel of novel biomarkers for AD. In this review, we discuss the metabolism and diagnostic performance of the well-established core candidate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Î²-amyloid, total tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau). Meanwhile, novel promising CSF biomarkers, especially those identified by proteomics, updated in the last five years are also extensively discussed. Furthermore, we provide perspectives on how biomarker discovery for AD is evolving. 
24733655	Lipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci Bull 20140415 2014Apr
Lipids play crucial roles in cell signaling and various physiological processes, especially in the brain. Impaired lipid metabolism in the brain has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other central nervous system insults. The brain contains thousands of lipid species, but the complex lipid compositional diversity and the function of each of lipid species are currently poorly understood. This review integrates current knowledge about major lipid changes with the molecular mechanisms that underlie AD pathogenesis. 
24569123	Loss of Calbindin immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus distinguishes Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative dementias.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140223 2014Apr30
Calbindin (Cb) is one of the major Ca(2+) binding proteins exhibiting neuromodulatory functions such as long-term potentiation (LTP), synaptic plasticity, and memory functions. It is expressed in hippocampal interneurons, pyramidal cells and granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DGCs). Cb mRNA levels remain stable during normal ageing, but decrease in Alzheimer's, Huntington, and Parkinson's disease. A recent study suggested a link between AÎ²-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cognitive deficits and neuronal depletion of Cb. To evaluate whether this is specific for AD, we performed a comparative study of Cb immunoreactivity of DGCs in cases with AD-related neuropathologic change (49), grouped according to the stages of Braak and Braak, BB), Creutzfeldt-Jakob-disease (16), FTLD-tau Pick's disease type (PiD; 5), argyrophilic grain disease (8), and FTLD-TDP types A and B (6). The group of AD cases with BB stages V and VI showed the highest proportion of Cb negative cells in the DGC when compared to all other groups except PiD. The ratio of negative cells correlated significantly with the BB stages. While the total number of DGCs decreased with age in our series, loss of Cb immunoreactivity was shown to be age-dependent only in PiD and FTLD-TDP. We conclude, that late stage AD-neuropathologic change (BB V and VI stages) associates with significantly higher ratios of Cb negative DGCs and this correlates with advanced BB stage. This might suggest an accumulative effect of an epilepsy-like pathway on the Cb expression or the direct influence of local pathological protein deposits on the DGCs.  
24582897	A novel presenilin 1 mutation (Ala275Val) as cause of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140226 2014Apr30
Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene (PSEN1) are associated with familial Alzheimer disease (FAD). Here, we report on a 50-year-old patient presenting with progressive deterioration of his short-term memory and a family history of early-onset dementia. Diagnostic workup included a neuropsychological examination, structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers including total tau, phosphorylated tau, and AÎ²42 levels, as well as sequencing relevant fragments of the genes PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP. Additionally, we were able to obtain archival paraffin-embedded cerebellar tissue from the patient's father for cosegregation analysis. Clinical, neuropsychological and MR imaging data were indicative of early-onset Alzheimer disease. Furthermore, CSF biomarkers showed a typical pattern for Alzheimer disease. DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous nucleotide transition (c.824C&gt;T) in exon 8 of PSEN1, leading to an amino acid change from alanine to valine at codon 275 (Ala275Val). The same mutation was found in an archival brain specimen of the patient's demented father, but not in a blood sample of the non-demented mother. This mutation alters a conserved residue in the large hydrophilic loop of PS1, suggesting pathogenic relevance. Cosegregegation analysis and the structural as well as the presumed functional role of the mutated and highly conserved residue suggest FAD causing characteristics of the novel PSEN1 mutation Ala275Val.  
24602981	Methylation analysis of SST and SSTR4 promoters in the neocortex of Alzheimer's disease patients.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140303 2014Apr30
Several observations have pointed to a major pathogenic role of somatostatin depletion with respect to amyloid accumulation, which is often thought to be the crucial event in a cascade leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). As methylation of CpG islands plays an important role in gene silencing, we studied the methylation status of the CpG islands in the promoters of somatostatin (SST) and in that of its receptor subtype in the cerebral cortex, SSTR4, in tissue samples from the middle temporal (Brodmann area 22) and superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 9) of 5 severely affected AD patients aged 72-94 years (Braak stages V-C or VI-C) and 5 non-demented controls aged 50-92 years. Bisulfite sequencing of DNA from cortical gray and infracortical white matter showed that the DNA methylation status at the promoters of SST and SSTR4 did not significantly differ between AD and control samples in any of the regions analyzed. We confirmed these results using deep bisulfite sequencing of PCR products from the SST promoter amplified from DNA from the cortical gray of the superior frontal gyrus of all AD patients and non-demented controls. We observed a trend toward increased DNA methylation with increasing age. In conclusion, deregulated somatostatin signaling in the AD cortices studied cannot be explained by hypermethylation of the SST or SSTR4 promoter CpG islands.  
24733169	Association of rs6265 and rs2030324 polymorphisms in brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene with Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.
PLoS ONE 20140414 2014
The association between polymorphisms rs6265 and rs2030324 in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been widely reported, but the results remain controversial. A comprehensive search of Pubmed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Med Online and China Biology Medical literature database (CBM) was performed. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random-effects models. We excluded the studies with OR&gt;3.0 or OR&lt;0.3 for sensitive analysis. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity, form of AD and gender was carried out. Meta-regression was conducted to explore the potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. 29 articles with 7548 cases and 7334 controls concerning rs6265 and 22 articles with 5796 cases and 5706 controls concerning rs2030324 were included in this meta-analysis. The combined evidence suggested rs6265 contributing significantly to the increased risk of AD in females (codominant: fixed-effects model (FEM): ORâ€Š=â€Š1.13, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.04-1.23; dominant: FEM: ORâ€Š=â€Š1.17, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.05-1.31), especially for Caucasian females (codominant: FEM: ORâ€Š=â€Š1.18, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.03-1.34; dominant: FEM: ORâ€Š=â€Š1.18, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.01-1.37) and female late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) patients (codominant: FEM: ORâ€Š=â€Š1.22, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.05-1.41; dominant: FEM: ORâ€Š=â€Š1.23, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.03-1.46). No evidence indicated an association between rs2030324 with AD in codominant (random-effects model (REM): ORâ€Š=â€Š1.06, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š0.89-1.26) and dominant (REM: ORâ€Š=â€Š1.05, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š0.86-1.27) models. This meta-analysis suggested A allele of rs6265 might increase the risk of AD in Caucasian females and female LOAD patients. In addition, no evidence indicated an association between rs2030324 with AD. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.

Soins Gerontol  2014 Mar-Apr
A support group for Alzheimer's patients in a day care centre is an innovative concept. A place of listening and exchanges, it gives participants an opportunity to speak and helps them form a positive image of themselves.This scheme is supported by an ethical approach which consists in interacting with the person away from the confines of the stigmatising representations associated with Alzheimer's disease. 
23659628	Neuropsychological indicators of preclinical Alzheimer's disease among depressed older adults.
Neuropsychol Dev Cogn B Aging Neuropsychol Cogn 20130509 2014
Older adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) may also have preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Differential diagnosis is quite challenging due to the overlapping symptoms of MDD and AD. In the current study, we predicted that impaired long-term memory (an area most affected in early AD), but not executive function (an area affected in MDD and AD), would distinguish older depressed patients who developed AD from those who did not. Patients (N = 120) assessed as having MDD but not dementia at baseline were administered tests of cognitive function and followed longitudinally for subsequent diagnosis of AD. Using structural equation modeling we found a latent construct of long-term memory to be associated with AD to a greater extent than executive functioning. Additional analyses to enhance clinical utility of findings indicated that individual tests of episodic memory were most predictive of AD status. Tests of long-term memory can be utilized by the clinician when assessing for preclinical AD among depressed elderly. 
24353340	Practical utility of amyloid and FDG-PET in an academic dementia center.
Neurology 20131218 2014Jan21
To evaluate the effect of amyloid imaging on clinical decision making. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 140 cognitively impaired patients (mean age 65.0 years, 46% primary Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) diagnosis, mean Mini-Mental State Examination 22.3) who underwent amyloid (Pittsburgh compound B [PiB]) PET as part of observational research studies and were evaluated clinically before and after the scan. One hundred thirty-four concurrently underwent fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. We assessed for changes between the pre- and post-PET clinical diagnosis (from AÎ² to non-AÎ² diagnosis or vice versa) and Alzheimer disease treatment plan. The association between PiB/FDG results and changes in management was evaluated using Ï‡(2) and multivariate logistic regression. Postmortem diagnosis was available for 24 patients (17%). Concordance between scan results and baseline diagnosis was high (PiB 84%, FDG 82%). The primary diagnosis changed after PET in 13/140 patients (9%) overall but in 5/13 (38%) patients considered pre-PET diagnostic dilemmas. When examined independently, discordant PiB and discordant FDG were both associated with diagnostic change (unadjusted p &lt; 0.0001). However, when examined together in a multivariate logistic regression, only discordant PiB remained significant (adjusted p = 0.00013). Changes in treatment were associated with discordant PiB in patients with non-AÎ² diagnoses (adjusted p = 0.028), while FDG had no effect on therapy. Both PiB (96%) and FDG (91%) showed high agreement with autopsy diagnosis. PET had a moderate effect on clinical outcomes. Discordant PiB had a greater effect than discordant FDG, and influence on diagnosis was greater than on treatment. Prospective studies are needed to better characterize the clinical role of amyloid PET. 
24107601	Imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in the search for Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.
Neurodegener Dis 20131002 2014
The pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins many years before the emergence of clinical symptoms (preclinical AD). A hypothetical biomarker progression in the pathogenesis of AD has been suggested, beginning with the deposition of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and followed by increases in neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss, hippocampal atrophy, and lastly, cognitive impairment. We explored the effect of several risk factors for AD on the pattern of AD biomarker expression in normal subjects. AD biomarker evidence was examined at baseline in 96 cognitively normal elderly subjects with none or at least one of the following: ApoE4+ allele, a maternal history of AD (mFHx), sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and longitudinal evidence of decline to mild cognitive impairment or AD (decliners) at follow-up. Decliners and ApoE4+ subjects presented with expected reduced cerebrospinal fluid AÎ²42, elevated P-tau and T-tau. In addition, decliners had fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe. Individuals with mFHx demonstrated no AÎ²42 effect, but had elevations in P-tau and T-tau. SDB was found to be associated with elevated AÎ²42, P-tau and T-tau, as well as with reduced medial temporal lobe glucose metabolic rates. Our results indicate a heterogeneous biomarker expression, suggesting diversity of AD pathways in at-risk presymptomatic subjects. 
24502686	The independent contributions of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms to everyday function in older adults.
Clin Neuropsychol 20140206 2014
The everyday functional capacities of older adults are determined by multiple factors. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate whether apathy and depression have unique influences on degree of functional impairment, independent of the effects of specific cognitive impairments. Participants included 344 older adults (199 normal, 87 with MCI, 58 with dementia). The Everyday Cognition (ECog) scales were used to measure both global and domain-specific functional abilities. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of depression and apathy were measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and specific neuropsychological domains measured included episodic memory and executive functioning. Results indicated that worse memory and executive function, as well as greater depression and apathy, were all independent and additive determinants of poorer functional abilities. Apathy had a slightly more restricted effect than the other variables across the specific functional domains assessed. Secondary analysis suggested that neuropsychiatric symptoms may be more strongly associated with everyday function within cognitively normal and MCI groups, while cognitive impairment is more strongly associated with everyday function in dementia. Thus, a somewhat different set of factors may be associated with functional status across various clinical groups.  
24623762	Genetic suppression of transgenic APP rescues Hypersynchronous network activity in a mouse model of Alzeimer's disease.
J. Neurosci.  2014Mar12
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an elevated risk for seizures that may be fundamentally connected to cognitive dysfunction. Supporting this link, many mouse models for AD exhibit abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in addition to the expected neuropathology and cognitive deficits. Here, we used a controllable transgenic system to investigate how network changes develop and are maintained in a model characterized by amyloid Î² (AÎ²) overproduction and progressive amyloid pathology. EEG recordings in tet-off mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) from birth display frequent sharp wave discharges (SWDs). Unexpectedly, we found that withholding APP overexpression until adulthood substantially delayed the appearance of epileptiform activity. Together, these findings suggest that juvenile APP overexpression altered cortical development to favor synchronized firing. Regardless of the age at which EEG abnormalities appeared, the phenotype was dependent on continued APP overexpression and abated over several weeks once transgene expression was suppressed. Abnormal EEG discharges were independent of plaque load and could be extinguished without altering deposited amyloid. Selective reduction of AÎ² with a Î³-secretase inhibitor has no effect on the frequency of SWDs, indicating that another APP fragment or the full-length protein was likely responsible for maintaining EEG abnormalities. Moreover, transgene suppression normalized the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory innervation in the cortex, whereas secretase inhibition did not. Our results suggest that APP overexpression, and not AÎ² overproduction, is responsible for EEG abnormalities in our transgenic mice and can be rescued independently of pathology.  
24623782	PPARÎ³ recruitment to active ERK during memory consolidation is required for Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive enhancement.
J. Neurosci.  2014Mar12
Cognitive impairment is a quintessential feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD mouse models. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³) agonist rosiglitazone improves hippocampus-dependent cognitive deficits in some AD patients and ameliorates deficits in the Tg2576 mouse model for AD amyloidosis. Tg2576 cognitive enhancement occurs through the induction of a gene and protein expression profile reflecting convergence of the PPARÎ³ signaling axis and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) cascade, a critical mediator of memory consolidation. We therefore tested whether PPARÎ³ and ERK associated in protein complexes that subserve cognitive enhancement through PPARÎ³ agonism. Coimmunoprecipitation of hippocampal extracts revealed that PPARÎ³ and activated, phosphorylated ERK (pERK) associated in Tg2576 in vivo, and that PPARÎ³ agonism facilitated recruitment of PPARÎ³ to pERK during memory consolidation. Furthermore, the amount of PPARÎ³ recruited to pERK correlated with the cognitive reserve in humans with AD and in Tg2576. Our findings implicate a previously unidentified PPARÎ³-pERK complex that provides a molecular mechanism for the convergence of these pathways during cognitive enhancement, thereby offering new targets for therapeutic development in AD.  
24439479	The interaction between sleep-disordered breathing and apolipoprotein E genotype on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal elderly individuals.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131227 2014Jun
Previous studies have suggested a link between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and dementia risk. In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between SDB severity, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease-biomarkers, and the ApoE alleles. A total of 95 cognitively normal elderly participants were analyzed for SDB severity, CSF measures of phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), total-tau (t-tau), and amyloid beta 42 (AÎ²-42), as well as ApoE allele status. In ApoE3+ subjects, significant differences were found between sleep groups for p-tau (F[df2] = 4.3, p = 0.017), and t-tau (F[df2] = 3.3, p = 0.043). Additionally, among ApoE3+ subjects, the apnea and/or hypopnea with 4% O2-desaturation index was positively correlated with p-tau (r = 0.30, p = 0.023), t-tau (r = 0.31, p = 0.021), and AÎ²-42 (r = 0.31, p = 0.021). In ApoE2+ subjects, the apnea and/or hypopnea with 4% O2-desaturation index was correlated with lower levels of CSF AÎ²-42 (r = -0.71, p = 0.004), similarly to ApoE4+ subjects where there was also a trend toward lower CSF AÎ²-42 levels. Our observations suggest that there is an association between SDB and CSF Alzheimer's disease-biomarkers in cognitively normal elderly individuals. Existing therapies for SDB such as continuous positive airway pressure could delay the onset to mild cognitive impairment or dementia in normal elderly individuals. 
24598317	Spectral and complexity analysis of scalp EEG characteristics for mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease.
Comput Methods Programs Biomed 20140208 2014Apr
Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) often is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI is characterized by cognitive decline departing from normal cognitive aging but that does not significantly interfere with daily activities. This study explores the potential of scalp EEG for early detection of alterations from cognitively normal status of older adults signifying MCI and AD. Resting 32-channel EEG records from 48 age-matched participants (mean age 75.7 years)-15 normal controls (NC), 16 early MCI, and 17 early stage AD-are examined. Regional spectral and complexity features are computed and used in a support vector machine model to discriminate between groups. Analyses based on three-way classifications demonstrate overall discrimination accuracies of 83.3%, 85.4%, and 79.2% for resting eyes open, counting eyes closed, and resting eyes closed protocols, respectively. These results demonstrate the great promise for scalp EEG spectral and complexity features as noninvasive biomarkers for detection of MCI and early AD.  
24231510	Statins more than cholesterol lowering agents in Alzheimer disease: their pleiotropic functions as potential therapeutic targets.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20131111 2014Apr15
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe cognitive impairment, inability to perform activities of daily living and mood changes. Statins, long known to be beneficial in conditions where dyslipidemia occurs by lowering serum cholesterol levels, also have been proposed for use in neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. However, it is not clear that the purported effectiveness of statins in neurodegenerative disorders is directly related to cholesterol-lowering effects of these agents; rather, the pleiotropic functions of statins likely play critical roles. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the new discoveries about the effects of statin therapy on the oxidative and nitrosative stress levels as well as on the modulation of the heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase (HO/BVR) system in the brain. We propose a novel mechanism of action for atorvastatin which, through the activation of HO/BVR-A system, may contribute to the neuroprotective effects thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in AD and potentially accounting for the observation of decreased AD incidence with persons on statin.  
24269629	Novel lipid signaling pathways in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20131121 2014Apr15
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. With an increasing longevity and the absence of a cure, AD has become not only a major health problem but also a heavy social and economic burden worldwide. In addition to the presence of abundant intra- and extra-cellular neurotoxic amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptides, which form the amyloid plaques, and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein, the main component of neurofibrillary tangles, consistent evidence indicates that the AD brain is characterized by extensive neuroinflammatory processes. The 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) is a pro-inflammatory enzymatic pathway widely distributed within the central nervous system and is up-regulated in AD. In the last five years our group has been involved in unraveling the neurobiology of this protein and investigating its relationship with cellular and molecular events of functional importance in AD pathogenesis. By using a combination of in vitro and in vivo experimental tools and implementing genetic as well as pharmacological approaches today we know that 5LO is likely an endogenous regulator of AÎ² formation via the modulation of the Î³-secretase complex, and tau metabolism by modulating its phosphorylation state at specific epitopes via the cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk-5). In addition, 5LO influences synaptic function and integrity and by doing so significantly affects learning and memory in the Tg2576 and 3xTg AD transgenic mouse models. Taken together our data establish this protein as a pleiotropic contributor to the development of the full spectrum of the AD-like phenotype in these mouse models of the disease, making it a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD in humans.  
24275164	Perspective on future role of biological markers in clinical therapy trials of Alzheimer's disease: a long-range point of view beyond 2020.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20131122 2014Apr15
Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying various paths toward the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has begun to provide new insight for interventions to modify disease progression. The evolving knowledge gained from multidisciplinary basic research has begun to identify new concepts for treatments and distinct classes of therapeutic targets; as well as putative disease-modifying compounds that are now being tested in clinical trials. There is a mounting consensus that such disease modifying compounds and/or interventions are more likely to be effectively administered as early as possible in the cascade of pathogenic processes preceding and underlying the clinical expression of AD. The budding sentiment is that "treatments" need to be applied before various molecular mechanisms converge into an irreversible pathway leading to morphological, metabolic and functional alterations that characterize the pathophysiology of AD. In light of this, biological indicators of pathophysiological mechanisms are desired to chart and detect AD throughout the asymptomatic early molecular stages into the prodromal and early dementia phase. A major conceptual development in the clinical AD research field was the recent proposal of new diagnostic criteria, which specifically incorporate the use of biomarkers as defining criteria for preclinical stages of AD. This paradigm shift in AD definition, conceptualization, operationalization, detection and diagnosis represents novel fundamental opportunities for the modification of interventional trial designs. This perspective summarizes not only present knowledge regarding biological markers but also unresolved questions on the status of surrogate indicators for detection of the disease in asymptomatic people and diagnosis of AD.  
24304687	The end of Alzheimer's disease--from biochemical pharmacology to ecopsychosociology: a personal perspective.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20131201 2014Apr15
The future of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field involves a more complete understanding not only the state of current scientific approaches, but also the linguistic and cultural context of preclinical and clinical research and policy activities. The challenges surrounding dementia are large and growing but are only part of broader social and health concerns. In this latter context, the current state of research in the AD area is reviewed together with necessary priorities in moving forward. Creating a more optimistic future will depend less on genetic and reductionist approaches and more on environmental and intergenerative approaches that will aid in recalibrating the study of AD from an almost exclusive focus on biochemical, molecular and genetic aspects to better encompass "real world" ecological and psychosocial models of health.  
24316434	Mitochondrial respiration as a target for neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20131204 2014Apr15
This paper focuses on brain mitochondrial respiration as a therapeutic target for neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement. We propose that improving brain mitochondrial respiration is an important future direction in research and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other conditions associated with cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. The central thesis is that supporting and improving brain mitochondrial respiration constitutes a promising neurotherapeutic principle, with potential applications in AD as well as in a wide variety of neuropsychological conditions. We propose three different interventional approaches to improve brain mitochondrial respiration based on (a) pharmacology, (b) photobiomodulation and (c) nutrition interventions, and provide detailed examples for each type of intervention. First, low-dose USP methylene blue is described as a pharmacological intervention that can successfully increase mitochondrial respiration and result in memory enhancement and neuroprotection. Second, transcranial low-level light/laser therapy with near-infrared light is used to illustrate a photobiomodulation intervention with similar neurometabolic mechanisms of action as low-dose methylene blue. Finally, a nutrition intervention to improve mitochondrial respiration is proposed by increasing ketone bodies in the diet. The evidence discussed for each intervention supports a fundamental neurotherapeutic strategy based on improving oxidative energy metabolism while at the same time reducing the pro-oxidant tendencies of the nervous system. Targeting brain mitochondrial respiration with these three types of interventions is proposed as part of a holistic neurotherapeutic approach to improve brain energy metabolism and antioxidant defenses. This strategy represents a promising new bioenergetics direction for treatment of AD and other neuropsychological disorders featuring cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration.  
24355566	TREM2 and the neuroimmunology of Alzheimer's disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20131216 2014Apr15
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a sporadic disorder with increasing prevalence in aging. The É›4 allele of Apolipoprotein E(ApoEÉ›4) was the only known major risk factor for late onset AD. Recently, two groups of investigators independently identified variants of the TREM2 gene, encoding triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 as causing increased susceptibility to late onset AD with an odds ratio similar to that of ApoEÉ›4. TREM2 is a receptor expressed on innate immune cells. Using a novel technology called Direct RNA Sequencing wedetermined the quantitative transcriptome of microglia, the principal innate neuroimmune cells and confirmed that TREM2 is a major microglia-specific gene in the central nervous system. Over the past several years we have shown that microglia play a dichotomous role in AD. Microglia can be protective and promote phagocytosis, degradation and ultimately clearance of AÎ², the pathogenic protein deposited in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. However, with disease progression, microglia become dysfunctional, release neurotoxins, lose their ability to clear AÎ² and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote AÎ² production and accumulation. TREM2 has been shown to regulate the phagocytic ability of myeloid cells and their inflammatory response. Here we propose that the mechanism(s) by which TREM2 variants cause Alzheimer's disease are via down regulation of the AÎ² phagocytic ability of microglia and by dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory response of these cells. Based on our discussion we propose that TREM2 is a potential therapeutic target for stopping ordelaying progression of AD.  
24361915	Tau-aggregation inhibitor therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20131219 2014Apr15
Many trials of drugs aimed at preventing or clearing Î²-amyloid pathology have failed to demonstrate efficacy in recent years and further trials continue with drugs aimed at the same targets and mechanisms. The Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangle is composed of tau and the core of its constituent filaments are made of a truncated fragment from the repeat domain of tau. This truncated tau can catalyse the conversion of normal soluble tau into aggregated oligomeric and fibrillar tau which, in turn, can spread to neighbouring neurons. Tau aggregation is not a late-life process and onset of Braak stage 1 peaks in people in their late 40s or early 50s. Tau aggregation pathology at Braak stage 1 or beyond affects 50% of the population over the age of 45. The initiation of tau aggregation requires its binding to a non-specific substrate to expose a high affinity tau-tau binding domain and it is self-propagating thereafter. The initiating substrate complex is most likely formed as a consequence of a progressive loss of endosomal-lysosomal processing of neuronal proteins, particularly of membrane proteins from mitochondria. Mutations in the APP/presenilin membrane complex may simply add to the age-related endosomal-lysosomal processing failure, bringing forward, but not directly causing, the tau aggregation cascade in carriers. Methylthioninium chloride (MTC), the first identified tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI), offers an alternative to the amyloid approach. Phase 3 trials are underway with a novel stabilized reduced form of methylthioninium (LMTX) that has improved tolerability and absorption.  
24380887	Brain metabolic dysfunction at the core of Alzheimer's disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20131228 2014Apr15
Growing evidence supports the concept that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is fundamentally a metabolic disease with molecular and biochemical features that correspond with diabetes mellitus and other peripheral insulin resistance disorders. Brain insulin/IGF resistance and its consequences can readily account for most of the structural and functional abnormalities in AD. However, disease pathogenesis is complicated by the fact that AD can occur as a separate disease process, or arise in association with systemic insulin resistance diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Whether primary or secondary in origin, brain insulin/IGF resistance initiates a cascade of neurodegeneration that is propagated by metabolic dysfunction, increased oxidative and ER stress, neuro-inflammation, impaired cell survival, and dysregulated lipid metabolism. These injurious processes compromise neuronal and glial functions, reduce neurotransmitter homeostasis, and cause toxic oligomeric pTau and (amyloid beta peptide of amyloid beta precursor protein) AÎ²PP-AÎ² fibrils and insoluble aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles and plaques) to accumulate in brain. AD progresses due to: (1) activation of a harmful positive feedback loop that progressively worsens the effects of insulin resistance; and (2) the formation of ROS- and RNS-related lipid, protein, and DNA adducts that permanently damage basic cellular and molecular functions. Epidemiologic data suggest that insulin resistance diseases, including AD, are exposure-related in etiology. Furthermore, experimental and lifestyle trend data suggest chronic low-level nitrosamine exposures are responsible. These concepts offer opportunities to discover and implement new treatments and devise preventive measures to conquer the AD and other insulin resistance disease epidemics.  
24398425	Alzheimer disease: epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, risk factors and biomarkers.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140104 2014Apr15
The global prevalence of dementia is as high as 24 million, and has been predicted to quadruple by the year 2050. In the US alone, Alzheimer disease (AD) - the most frequent cause of dementia characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function in particular the memory domain - causes estimated health-care costs of $ 172 billion per year. Key neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques - often surrounded by dystrophic neurites - and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological changes are frequently accompanied by reactive microgliosis and loss of neurons, white matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying these neuropathological changes remain unclear, but are probably caused by both environmental and genetic factors. In this review article, we provide an overview of the epidemiology of AD, review the biomarkers that may be used for risk assessment and in diagnosis, and give suggestions for future research.  
24412275	Is synaptic loss a unique hallmark of Alzheimer's disease?
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140109 2014Apr15
Synapses may represent a key nidus for dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here we review published studies and present new ideas related to the question of the specificity of synapse loss in AD. Currently, AD is defined by the regional presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The severity of involvement by those pathological hallmarks tends to correlate both with antemortem cognitive status, and also with synapse loss in multiple brain areas. Recent studies from large autopsy series have led to a new standard of excellence with regard to clinical-pathological correlation and to improved comprehension of the numerous brain diseases of the elderly. These studies have provided evidence that it is the rule rather than the exception for brains of aged individuals to demonstrate pathologies (often multiple) other than AD plaques and tangles. For many of these comorbid pathologies, the extent of synapse loss is imperfectly understood but could be substantial. These findings indicate that synapse loss is probably not a hallmark specific to AD but rather a change common to many diseases associated with dementia.  
24412277	Immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140109 2014Apr15
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. In AD the normal soluble amyloid Î² (sAÎ²) peptide is converted into oligomeric/fibrillar AÎ². The oligomeric forms of AÎ² are thought to be the most toxic, while fibrillar AÎ² becomes deposited as amyloid plaques and congophilic angiopathy, which serve as neuropathological markers of the disease. In addition the accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau as soluble toxic oligomers and as neurofibrillary tangles is a critical part of the pathology. Numerous therapeutic interventions are under investigation to prevent and treat AD. Among the more exciting and advanced of these approaches is vaccination. Active and passive Immunotherapy targeting only AÎ² has been successful in many AD model animal trials; however, the more limited human data has shown much less benefit so far, with encephalitis occurring in a minority of patients treated with active immunization and vasogenic edema or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) being a complication in some passive immunization trials. Therapeutic intervention targeting only tau has been tested only in mouse models; and no approaches targeting both pathologies concurrently has been attempted, until very recently. The immune approaches tried so far were targeting a self-protein, albeit in an abnormal conformation; however, effective enhanced clearance of the disease associated conformer has to be balanced with the potential risk of stimulating excessive toxic inflammation. The design of future more effective immunomodulatory approaches will need to target all aspects of AD pathology, as well as specifically targeting pathological oligomeric conformers, without the use of any self-antigen.  
24418410	Future directions in Alzheimer's disease from risk factors to prevention.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140110 2014Apr15
The increase in life expectancy has resulted in a high occurrence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research on AD has undergone a paradigm shift from viewing it as a disease of old age to taking a life course perspective. Several vascular, lifestyle, psychological and genetic risk factors influencing this latent period have been recognized and they may act both independently and by potentiating each other. These risk factors have consequently been used to derive risk scores for predicting the likelihood of dementia. Despite population differences, age, low education and vascular risk factors were identified as key factors in all scoring systems. Risk scores can help to identify high-risk individuals who might benefit from different interventions. The European Dementia Prevention Initiative (EDPI), an international collaboration, encourages data sharing between different randomized controlled trials. At the moment, it includes three large ongoing European trials: Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (preDIVA), and Multidomain Alzheimer Prevention study (MAPT). Recently EDPI has developed a "Healthy Aging through Internet Counseling in Elderly" (HATICE) program, which intends to manage modifiable risk factors in an aged population through an easily accessible Internet platform. Thus, the focus of dementia research has shifted from identification of potential risk factors to using this information for developing interventions to prevent or delay the onset of dementia as well as identifying special high-risk populations who could be targeted in intervention trials.  
24434190	Therapeutic implications of the prostaglandin pathway in Alzheimer's disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140113 2014Apr15
An important pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuroinflammation, a process characterized in AD by disproportionate activation of cells (microglia and astrocytes, primarily) of the non-specific innate immune system within the CNS. While inflammation itself is not intrinsically detrimental, a delicate balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory signals must be maintained to ensure that long-term exaggerated responses do not damage the brain over time. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent a broad class of powerful therapeutics that temper inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-mediated signaling pathways including prostaglandins, which are the principal mediators of CNS neuroinflammation. While historically used to treat discrete or systemic inflammatory conditions, epidemiologic evidence suggests that protracted NSAID use may delay AD onset, as well as decrease disease severity and rate of progression. Unfortunately, clinical trials with NSAIDs have thus far yielded disappointing results, including premature discontinuation of a large-scale prevention trial due to unexpected cardiovascular side effects. Here we review the literature and make the argument that more targeted exploitation of downstream prostaglandin signaling pathways may offer significant therapeutic benefits for AD while minimizing adverse side effects. Directed strategies such as these may ultimately help to delay the deleterious consequences of brain aging and might someday lead to new therapies for AD and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases.  
24445162	Microglial dysfunction in brain aging and Alzheimer's disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140118 2014Apr15
Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, have long been a subject of study in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field due to their dramatic responses to the pathophysiology of the disease. With several large-scale genetic studies in the past year implicating microglial molecules in AD, the potential significance of these cells has become more prominent than ever before. As a disease that is tightly linked to aging, it is perhaps not entirely surprising that microglia of the AD brain share some phenotypes with aging microglia. Yet the relative impacts of both conditions on microglia are less frequently considered in concert. Furthermore, microglial "activation" and "neuroinflammation" are commonly analyzed in studies of neurodegeneration but are somewhat ill-defined concepts that in fact encompass multiple cellular processes. In this review, we have enumerated six distinct functions of microglia and discuss the specific effects of both aging and AD. By calling attention to the commonalities of these two states, we hope to inspire new approaches for dissecting microglial mechanisms.  
24447936	The complexities of the pathology-pathogenesis relationship in Alzheimer disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140118 2014Apr15
Current pathogenic theories for Alzheimer disease (AD) and aging favor the notion that lesions and their constituent proteins are the initiators of disease due to toxicity. Whether this is because structural pathology is traditionally viewed as deleterious, and whether this, in turn, is a fundamental misinterpretation of the relationship between pathology and pathogenesis across the spectrum of chronic diseases, remains to be determined. As more and more detailed information about the biochemical constituents of AD lesions becomes available, it may also be argued that just as much knowledge of cellular physiology as pathophysiology has been gained. Indeed, essentially all major proteins in AD lesions are derived from molecular cascades, which are in turn highly conserved across cells, tissues, and species. Moreover, the lesions themselves are observed in the cognitively intact, and sometimes in large numbers, while major consensus criteria indicate that an extent of pathology is normal with advanced age. As the medical science community continues to pursue lesion targeting for therapeutic purposes, the notion that AD pathology is indicative of an active host response or environmental adaptation, and therefore a poor target, is becoming clearer.  
24462903	Pathogenesis of synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140121 2014Apr15
Considerable progress has been made in the past few years in the fight against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuropathological studies in human brains and experimental in vivo and in vitro models support the notion that synapses are affected even at the earliest stages of the neurodegenerative process. The objective of this manuscript is to review some of the mechanisms of synaptic damage in AD and PD. Some lines of evidence support the notion that oligomeric neurotoxic species of amyloid Î², Î±-synuclein, and Tau might contribute to the pathogenesis of synaptic failure at early stages of the diseases. The mechanisms leading to synaptic damage by oligomers might involve dysregulation of glutamate receptors and scaffold molecules that results in alterations in the axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and mitochondria that later on lead to dendritic and spine alterations, axonal dystrophy, and eventually neuronal loss. However, while some studies support a role of oligomers, there is an ongoing debate as to the exact nature of the toxic species. Given the efforts toward earlier clinical and preclinical diagnosis of these disorders, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic degeneration is crucial toward developing specific biomarkers and new therapies targeting the synaptic apparatus of vulnerable neurons.  
24462904	Behavioral assays with mouse models of Alzheimer's disease: practical considerations and guidelines.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140121 2014Apr15
In Alzheimer's disease (AD) basic research and drug discovery, mouse models are essential resources for uncovering biological mechanisms, validating molecular targets and screening potential compounds. Both transgenic and non-genetically modified mouse models enable access to different types of AD-like pathology in vivo. Although there is a wealth of genetic and biochemical studies on proposed AD pathogenic pathways, as a disease that centrally features cognitive failure, the ultimate readout for any interventions should be measures of learning and memory. This is particularly important given the lack of knowledge on disease etiology - assessment by cognitive assays offers the advantage of targeting relevant memory systems without requiring assumptions about pathogenesis. A multitude of behavioral assays are available for assessing cognitive functioning in mouse models, including ones specific for hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Here we review the basics of available transgenic and non-transgenic AD mouse models and detail three well-established behavioral tasks commonly used for testing hippocampal-dependent cognition in mice - contextual fear conditioning, radial arm water maze and Morris water maze. In particular, we discuss the practical considerations, requirements and caveats of these behavioral testing paradigms.  
24462919	New perspectives on the role of tau in Alzheimer's disease. Implications for therapy.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20140122 2014Apr15
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias constitute a major public health issue due to an increasingly aged population as a consequence of generally improved medical care and demographic changes. Current drug treatment of AD, the most prevalent dementia, with cholinesterase inhibitors or NMDA antagonists have demonstrated very modest, symptomatic efficacy, leaving an unmet medical need for new, more effective therapies. While drug development efforts in the last two decades have primarily focused on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, so far with disappointing results, tau-based strategies have received little attention until recently despite that the presence of extensive tau pathology is central to the disease. The discovery of mutations within the tau gene that cause fronto-temporal dementia demonstrated that tau dysfunction, in the absence of amyloid pathology, was sufficient to cause neuronal loss and clinical dementia. Abnormal levels and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein have been reported to be the underlying cause of a group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as 'tauopathies'. The detrimental consequence is the loss of affinity between this protein and the microtubules, increased production of fibrillary aggregates and the accumulation of insoluble intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. However, it has become clear in recent years that tau is not only a microtubule interacting protein, but rather has additional roles in cellular processes. This review focuses on emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at treating the underlying causes of the tau pathology in tauopathies and AD, including some novel approaches on the verge of providing new treatment paradigms within the coming years.  
24554232	Preventive effects of ramelteon on delirium: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
JAMA Psychiatry  2014Apr
No highly effective interventions to prevent delirium have been identified. To examine whether ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, is effective for the prevention of delirium. A multicenter, rater-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial was performed in intensive care units and regular acute wards of 4 university hospitals and 1 general hospital. Eligible patients were 65 to 89 years old, newly admitted due to serious medical problems, and able to take medicine orally. Patients were excluded from the study if they had an expected stay or life expectancy of less than 48 hours. Sixty-seven patients were randomly assigned using the sealed envelope method to receive ramelteon (8 mg/d; 33 patients) or placebo (34 patients) every night for 7 days. Incidence of delirium, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition). Ramelteon was associated with a lower risk of delirium (3% vs 32%; P =â€‰.003), with a relative risk of 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.69). Even after risk factors were controlled for, ramelteon was still associated with a lower incidence of delirium (P =â€‰.01; odds ratio, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.008-0.54]). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to development of delirium were 6.94 (95% CI, 6.82-7.06) days for ramelteon and 5.74 (5.05-6.42) days for placebo. Comparison by log-rank test showed that the frequency of delirium was significantly lower in patients taking ramelteon than in those taking placebo (Ï‡(2) = 9.83; P =â€‰.002). Ramelteon administered nightly to elderly patients admitted for acute care may provide protection against delirium. This finding supports a possible pathogenic role of melatonin neurotransmission in delirium. University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry Identifier: UMIN000005591. 
24719136	Agmatine improves cognitive dysfunction and prevents cell death in a streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer rat model.
Yonsei Med. J. 20140401 2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in memory impairment and neuronal cell death in the brain. Previous studies demonstrated that intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (STZ) induces pathological and behavioral alterations similar to those observed in AD. Agmatine (Agm) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in central nervous system disorders. In this study, we investigated whether Agm treatment could attenuate apoptosis and improve cognitive decline in a STZ-induced Alzheimer rat model. We studied the effect of Agm on AD pathology using a STZ-induced Alzheimer rat model. For each experiment, rats were given anesthesia (chloral hydrate 300 mg/kg, ip), followed by a single injection of STZ (1.5 mg/kg) bilaterally into each lateral ventricle (5 Î¼L/ventricle). Rats were injected with Agm (100 mg/kg) daily up to two weeks from the surgery day. Agm suppressed the accumulation of amyloid beta and enhanced insulin signal transduction in STZ-induced Alzheimer rats [experimetal control (EC) group]. Upon evaluation of cognitive function by Morris water maze testing, significant improvement of learning and memory dysfunction in the STZ-Agm group was observed compared with the EC group. Western blot results revealed significant attenuation of the protein expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, as well as increases in the protein expressions of Bcl2, PI3K, Nrf2, and Î³-glutamyl cysteine synthetase, in the STZ-Agm group. Our results showed that Agm is involved in the activation of antioxidant signaling pathways and activation of insulin signal transduction. Accordingly, Agm may be a promising therapeutic agent for improving cognitive decline and attenuating apoptosis in AD. 
24486385	Targeting histone-modifications in Alzheimer's disease. What is the evidence that this is a promising therapeutic avenue?
Neuropharmacology 20140131 2014May
Alzheimer' s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia causing an increasing emotional and economical burden to our societies. Although much progress has been made regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie AD pathogenesis effective therapies are not available yet. The emerging field of neuroepigenetics has provided evidence that de-regulation of epigenetic processes play a role in AD. In this article we will critically review the primary research data that led to the hypothesis that targeting histone-modifying enzymes could be used to treat AD pathogenesis and address the question if the field is ready to translate such findings into clinical application. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Neuroepigenetic Disorders'. 
24633805	Total apolipoprotein E levels and specific isoform composition in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma from Alzheimer's disease patients and controls.
Acta Neuropathol. 20140315 2014May
The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) Îµ4 allele is the strongest risk factor of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the fluid concentrations of ApoE and its different isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4) in AD patients and among APOE genotypes (APOE Îµ2, Îµ3, Îµ4) remain controversial. Using a novel mass spectrometry-based method, we quantified total ApoE and specific ApoE isoform concentrations and potential associations with age, cognitive status, cholesterol levels and established AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients versus non-AD individuals with different APOE genotypes. We also investigated plasma total ApoE and ApoE isoform composition in a subset of these individuals. In total n = 43 AD and n = 43 non-AD subjects were included. We found that CSF and plasma total ApoE levels did not correlate with age or cognitive status and did not differ between AD and non-AD subjects deeming ApoE as an unfit diagnostic marker for AD. Also, whereas CSF ApoE levels did not vary between APOE genotypes APOE Îµ4 carriers exhibited significantly decreased plasma ApoE levels attributed to a specific decrease in the ApoE4 isoform concentrations. CSF total ApoE concentrations were positively associated with CSF, total tau, tau phosphorylated at Thr181 and AÎ²1-42 of which the latter association was weaker and only present in APOE Îµ4 carriers indicating a differential involvement of ApoE in tau versus AÎ²-linked neuropathological processes. Future studies need to elucidate whether the observed plasma ApoE4 deficiency is a life-long condition in APOE É›4 carriers and whether this decrease in plasma ApoE predisposes APOE É›4 carriers to AD. 
24682919	Evaluation of selenium, redox status and their association with plasma amyloid/tau in Alzheimer's disease.
Biol Trace Elem Res 20140330 2014May
The aim of the study was to evaluate blood selenium and antioxidants as possible oxidative stress markers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) along with amyloid Î²42 (AÎ²42) and tau by comparing them with vascular dementia (VD) and age-matched healthy controls. Selenium, total tau, AÎ²42, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were analysed in the blood of AD patients (nâ€‰=â€‰30), VD patients (nâ€‰=â€‰35) and controls (nâ€‰=â€‰40) from South India. Plasma AÎ²42 level was significantly higher (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) in both AD and VD compared to controls. Total tau and tau-to-amyloid ratio were significantly lower in both AD and VD (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), compared to controls, and a significant difference (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01 and Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05, respectively) was also observed between AD and VD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-derived cutoff values of &lt;3.5 for tau-to-AÎ²42 ratio and &lt;520 pg/ml for total tau showed sensitivity and specificity of around 67-72 % for differentiating AD from VD and around 90 % for AD from controls, indicating that they could serve as reliable AD-specific markers. The MDA levels were significantly higher (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) in both dementia groups along with a significant decrease (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) in reduced GSH levels, indicating elevated oxidative stress and altered redox status in both forms of dementia. Selenium levels did not vary significantly between the three groups. The activity of glutathione peroxidase increased in both AD and VD compared to controls, with a concomitant decrease in glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) activity. The activity of thioredoxin reductase was significantly lower in both patient groups (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) compared to healthy controls. No correlation was observed between selenium and activities of selenoenzymes, tau, AÎ²42 or tau-to-AÎ²42 ratio, when analysing independently, indicating that blood selenium may not be directly involved in AÎ² production and in regulating tau/AÎ²42-mediated mechanism in AD. The present study emphasizes the enhanced oxidative stress in AD pathology and plasma tau and tau-to-amyloid ratio as possible markers to differentiate AD from VD. The study also points that blood selenium may not be involved in regulating oxidative stress in AD, and a longitudinal study correlating plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) selenium and selenoprotein levels is warranted. 
24681980	Fluorinated benzophenone derivatives: balanced multipotent agents for Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140316 2014May6
In an effort to develop multipotent agents against Î²-secretase (BACE-1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), able to counteract intracellular ROS formation as well, the structure of the fluorinated benzophenone 3 served as starting point for the synthesis of a small library of 3-fluoro-4-hydroxy- analogues. Among the series, derivatives 5 and 12, carrying chemically different amino functions, showed a balanced micromolar potency against the selected targets. In particular, compound 12, completely devoid of toxic effects, seems to be a promising lead for obtaining effective anti-AD drug candidates.  
24405770	Peripheral expression of MAPK pathways in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
J Clin Neurosci 20131023 2014May
Alteration of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways may cause aberrant protein phosphorylation and enhanced apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Increased susceptibility of lymphocytes to apoptosis has been reported in AD. To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the expression and phosphorylation status of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 20 AD and 20 PD patients and 20 healthy controls using western blot analysis. Compared with controls, no significant difference of total p38MAPK or JNK levels were observed in AD and PD patients, whereas phosphorylated p38MAPK and phosphorylated JNK levels were significantly increased in the AD and PD groups (p&lt;0.001). However, the increased levels of the two phosphorylated kinases in AD versus PD patients presented no significant difference. Interestingly, phosphorylated p38MAPK and phosphorylated JNK levels were positively correlated with disease duration (r=0.602, p=0.005 and r=0.561, p=0.010, respectively) and negatively correlated with the Mini Mental State Examination score (r=-0.664, p=0.001 and r=-0.578, p=0.008, respectively) in AD patients. No correlations between protein levels and clinical variables were found in PD patients. Investigation of peripheral changes in the expression of p38MAPK and JNK may lead to the development of innovative biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly for AD. 
24423155	Effect of TTP488 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

TTP488, an antagonist at the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products, was evaluated as a potential treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). A previous report describes decreased decline in ADAS-cog (deltaâ€‰=â€‰3.1, pâ€‰=â€‰0.008 at 18 months, ANCOVA with multiple imputation), relative to placebo, following a 5 mg/day dose of TTP488. Acute, reversible cognitive worsening was seen with a 20 mg/day dose. The present study further evaluates the efficacy of TTP488 by subgroup analyses based on disease severity and concentration effect analysis. 399 patients were randomized to one of two oral TTP488 doses (60 mg for 6 days followed by 20 mg/day; 15 mg for 6 days followed by 5 mg/day) or placebo for 18 months. Pre-specified primary analysis, using an ITT population, was on the ADAS-cog11. Secondary analyses included as a key secondary variable the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and another secondary variable of the ADCS-ADL. On-treatment analysis demonstrated numerical differences favoring 5 mg/day over placebo, with nominal significance at Month 18 (deltaâ€‰=â€‰2.7, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03). Patients with mild AD, whether defined by MMSE or ADAS-cog, demonstrated significant differences favoring 5 mg/day on ADAS-cog and trends on CDR-sb and ADCS-ADL at Month 18. TTP488 plasma concentrations of 7.6-16.8 ng/mL were associated with a decreased decline in ADAS-cog over time compared to placebo. Worsening on the ADAS-cog relative to placebo was evident at 46.8-167.0 ng/mL. Results of these analyses support further investigation of 5 mg/day in future Phase 3 trials in patients with mild AD. 
24269021	Amyloid burden and neural function in people at risk for Alzheimer's Disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131023 2014Mar
To determine the relationship between amyloid burden and neural function in healthy adults at risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), we used multimodal imaging with [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography, [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose, positron emission tomography , and magnetic resonance imaging, together with cognitive measurement in 201 subjects (mean age, 60.1 years; range, 46-73 years) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention. Using a qualitative rating, 18% of the samples were strongly positive Beta-amyloid (AÎ²+), 41% indeterminate (AÎ²i), and 41% negative (AÎ²-). AÎ²+ was associated with older age, female sex, and showed trends for maternal family history of AD and APOE4. Relative to the AÎ²- group, AÎ²+ and AÎ²i participants had increased glucose metabolism in the bilateral thalamus; AÎ²+ participants also had increased metabolism in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus. AÎ²+ participants exhibited increased gray matter in the lateral parietal lobe bilaterally relative to the AÎ²- group, and no areas of significant atrophy. Cognitive performance and self report cognitive and affective symptoms did not differ between groups. Amyloid burden can be identified in adults at a mean age of 60 years and is accompanied by glucometabolic increases in specific areas, but not atrophy or cognitive loss. This asymptomatic stage may be an opportune window for intervention to prevent progression to symptomatic AD.  
24319000	Chemical structure informing statistical hypothesis testing in metabolomics.
Bioinformatics 20131205 2014Feb15
Metabolomics has been shown as an effective tool to study various biological and biomedical phenotypes, whereas interrogating the inherently noisy metabolite concentration data with limited sample size remains a major challenge. Accumulating evidence suggests that metabolites' structures are relevant to their bioactivities. We present a new strategy to boost the statistical power of hypothesis testing in metabolomics by incorporating quantitative molecular descriptors for each metabolite. The strategy selects potentially informative summary molecular descriptors and outputs chemical structure-informed false discovery rates. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by both simulation studies and a real application. In a metabolomic study on Alzheimer's disease, the posterior inclusion probability for summary molecular descriptors reaches 0.97. By incorporating the structure data, our approach uniquely identifies multiple Alzheimer's disease signatures, which are consistent with existing evidence. These results evidently suggest the value of the proposed approach for metabolomic hypothesis-testing problems. A code package implementing the strategy is freely available at https://github.com/HongjieZhu/CIMA.git. 
24607147	ApoE variant p.V236E is associated with markedly reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol Neurodegener 20140310 2014
Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which show significant association at the well-known APOE locus and at nineteen additional loci. Among the functional, disease-associated variants at these loci, missense variants are particularly important because they can be readily investigated in model systems to search for novel therapeutic targets. It is now possible to perform a low-cost search for these "actionable" variants by genotyping the missense variants at known LOAD loci already cataloged on the Exome Variant Server (EVS). In this proof-of-principle study designed to explore the efficacy of this approach, we analyzed three rare EVS variants in APOE, p.L28P, p.R145C and p.V236E, in our case control series of 9114 subjects. p.R145C proved to be too rare to analyze effectively. The minor allele of p.L28P, which was in complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1) with the far more common APOE Ïµ4 allele, showed no association with LOAD (P = 0.75) independent of the APOE Ïµ4 allele. p.V236E was significantly associated with a marked reduction in risk of LOAD (P = 7.5 Ã— 10â?»â?°â?µ; OR = 0.10, 0.03 to 0.45). The minor allele of p.V236E, which was in complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1) with the common APOE Ïµ3 allele, identifies a novel LOAD-associated haplotype (APOE Ïµ3b) which is associated with decreased risk of LOAD independent of the more abundant APOE Ïµ2, Ïµ3 and Ïµ4 haplotypes. Follow-up studies will be important to confirm the significance of this association and to better define its odds ratio. The ApoE p.V236E substitution is the first disease-associated change located in the lipid-binding, C-terminal domain of the protein. Thus our study (i) identifies a novel APOE missense variant which may profitably be studied to better understand how ApoE function may be modified to reduce risk of LOAD and (ii) indicates that analysis of protein-altering variants cataloged on the EVS can be a cost-effective way to identify actionable functional variants at recently discovered LOAD loci. 
24574361	The central molecular clock is robust in the face of behavioural arrhythmia in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease.
Dis Model Mech 20140226 2014Apr
Circadian behavioural deficits, including sleep irregularity and restlessness in the evening, are a distressing early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have investigated these phenomena by studying the circadian behaviour of transgenic Drosophila expressing the amyloid beta peptide (AÎ²). We find that AÎ² expression results in an age-related loss of circadian behavioural rhythms despite ongoing normal molecular oscillations in the central clock neurons. Even in the absence of any behavioural correlate, the synchronised activity of the central clock remains protective, prolonging lifespan, in AÎ² flies just as it does in control flies. Confocal microscopy and bioluminescence measurements point to processes downstream of the molecular clock as the main site of AÎ² toxicity. In addition, there seems to be significant non-cell-autonomous AÎ² toxicity resulting in morphological and probably functional signalling deficits in central clock neurons.  
23723177	Influence of magnetic field strength and image registration strategy on voxel-based morphometry in a study of Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Brain Mapp 20130530 2014May
Multi-centre data repositories like the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) offer a unique research platform, but pose questions concerning comparability of results when using a range of imaging protocols and data processing algorithms. The variability is mainly due to the non-quantitative character of the widely used structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. Although the stability of the main effect of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on brain structure across platforms and field strength has been addressed in previous studies using multi-site MR images, there are only sparse empirically-based recommendations for processing and analysis of pooled multi-centre structural MR data acquired at different magnetic field strengths (MFS). Aiming to minimise potential systematic bias when using ADNI data we investigate the specific contributions of spatial registration strategies and the impact of MFS on voxel-based morphometry in AD. We perform a whole-brain analysis within the framework of Statistical Parametric Mapping, testing for main effects of various diffeomorphic spatial registration strategies, of MFS and their interaction with disease status. Beyond the confirmation of medial temporal lobe volume loss in AD, we detect a significant impact of spatial registration strategy on estimation of AD related atrophy. Additionally, we report a significant effect of MFS on the assessment of brain anatomy (i) in the cerebellum, (ii) the precentral gyrus and (iii) the thalamus bilaterally, showing no interaction with the disease status. We provide empirical evidence in support of pooling data in multi-centre VBM studies irrespective of disease status or MFS. 
24039033	Brain network alterations in Alzheimer's disease measured by eigenvector centrality in fMRI are related to cognition and CSF biomarkers.
Hum Brain Mapp 20130903 2014May
Recent imaging studies have demonstrated functional brain network changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Eigenvector centrality (EC) is a graph analytical measure that identifies prominent regions in the brain network hierarchy and detects localized differences between patient populations. This study used voxel-wise EC mapping (ECM) to analyze individual whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in 39 AD patients (age 67 Â± 8) and 43 healthy controls (age 69 Â± 7). Between-group differences were assessed by a permutation-based method. Associations of EC with biomarkers for AD pathology in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were assessed using Spearman correlation analysis. Decreased EC was found bilaterally in the occipital cortex in AD patients compared to controls. Regions of increased EC were identified in the anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyrus. Across groups, frontal and occipital EC changes were associated with pathological concentrations of CSF biomarkers and with cognition. In controls, decreased EC values in the occipital regions were related to lower MMSE scores. Our main finding is that ECM, a hypothesis-free and computationally efficient analysis method of functional MRI (fMRI) data, identifies changes in brain network organization in AD patients that are related to cognition and underlying AD pathology. The relation between AD-like EC changes and cognitive performance suggests that resting-state fMRI measured EC is a potential marker of disease severity for AD. 
24482837	A versatile omnibus test for detecting mean and variance heterogeneity.
Genet. Epidemiol.  2014Jan
Recent research has revealed loci that display variance heterogeneity through various means such as biological disruption, linkage disequilibrium (LD), gene-by-gene (G Ã— G), or gene-by-environment interaction. We propose a versatile likelihood ratio test that allows joint testing for mean and variance heterogeneity (LRT(MV)) or either effect alone (LRT(M) or LRT(V)) in the presence of covariates. Using extensive simulations for our method and others, we found that all parametric tests were sensitive to nonnormality regardless of any trait transformations. Coupling our test with the parametric bootstrap solves this issue. Using simulations and empirical data from a known mean-only functional variant, we demonstrate how LD can produce variance-heterogeneity loci (vQTL) in a predictable fashion based on differential allele frequencies, high D', and relatively low rÂ² values. We propose that a joint test for mean and variance heterogeneity is more powerful than a variance-only test for detecting vQTL. This takes advantage of loci that also have mean effects without sacrificing much power to detect variance only effects. We discuss using vQTL as an approach to detect G Ã— G interactions and also how vQTL are related to relationship loci, and how both can create prior hypothesis for each other and reveal the relationships between traits and possibly between components of a composite trait. 
24425039	Age-specific incidence rates for dementia and Alzheimer disease in NIA-LOAD/NCRAD and EFIGA families: National Institute on Aging Genetics Initiative for Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease/National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NIA-LOAD/NCRAD) and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA).
JAMA Neurol  2014Mar
Late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), defined as onset of symptoms after age 65 years, is the most common form of dementia. Few reports investigate incidence rates in large family-based studies in which the participants were selected for family history of LOAD. To determine the incidence rates of dementia and LOAD in unaffected members in the National Institute on Aging Genetics Initiative for Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease/National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NIA-LOAD/NCRAD) and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) family studies. Families with 2 or more affected siblings who had a clinical or pathological diagnosis of LOAD were recruited as a part of the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD Family Study. A cohort of Caribbean Hispanics with familial LOAD was recruited in a different study at the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain in New York and from clinics in the Dominican Republic as part of the EFIGA study. Age-specific incidence rates of LOAD were estimated in the unaffected family members in the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD and EFIGA data sets. We restricted analyses to families with follow-up and complete phenotype information, including 396 NIA-LOAD/NCRAD and 242 EFIGA families. Among the 943 at-risk family members in the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD families, 126 (13.4%) developed dementia, of whom 109 (86.5%) met criteria for LOAD. Among 683 at-risk family members in the EFIGA families, 174 (25.5%) developed dementia during the study period, of whom 145 (83.3%) had LOAD. The annual incidence rates of dementia and LOAD in the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD families per person-year were 0.03 and 0.03, respectively, in participants aged 65 to 74 years; 0.07 and 0.06, respectively, in those aged 75 to 84 years; and 0.08 and 0.07, respectively, in those 85 years or older. Incidence rates in the EFIGA families were slightly higher, at 0.03 and 0.02, 0.06 and 0.05, 0.10 and 0.08, and 0.10 and 0.07, respectively, in the same age groups. Contrasting these results with the population-based estimates, the incidence was increased by 3-fold for NIA-LOAD/NCRAD families (standardized incidence ratio, 3.44) and 2-fold among the EFIGA compared with the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD families (1.71). The incidence rates for familial dementia and LOAD in the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD and EFIGA families are significantly higher than population-based estimates. The incidence rates in all groups increase with age. The higher incidence of LOAD can be explained by segregation of Alzheimer disease-related genes in these families or shared environmental risks. 
24489130	Intracranial artery stenosis and progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease.
Neurology 20140131 2014Mar11
To assess the impact of intracranial arterial stenosis on the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer disease (AD). A total of 423 participants with MCI were included and evaluated with clinical and neuropsychological examinations annually for 4 years. The incidence of dementia due to AD was investigated. CT angiography was used to measure the stenosis of major intracranial arteries in the studied population. A mixed-effects regression model was used to analyze the association between intracranial arterial stenosis and the progression of MCI, which was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Activities of Daily Living scale. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the association between intracranial arterial stenosis and dementia progression. At the end of the follow-up, 116 participants had progressed to dementia due to AD, while 223 remained in the MCI stage. Participants with moderate or severe intracranial arterial stenosis had a faster decline in cognition and function relative to participants without such stenosis. The presence of moderate or severe intracranial arterial stenosis significantly increased the risk of dementia progression, even after controlling for age, sex, education, vascular risk factors, and silent MRI lesions. Intracranial arterial stenosis increased the risk of developing AD dementia after MCI. 
24367935	A focus on structural brain imaging in the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative.
Biol. Psychiatry 20131128 2014Apr1
In recent years, numerous laboratories and consortia have used neuroimaging to evaluate the risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is a longitudinal, multicenter study that is evaluating a range of biomarkers for use in diagnosis of AD, prediction of patient outcomes, and clinical trials. These biomarkers include brain metrics derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography scans as well as metrics derived from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. We focus on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative studies published between 2011 and March 2013 for which structural MRI was a major outcome measure. Our main goal was to review key articles offering insights into progression of AD and the relationships of structural MRI measures to cognition and to other biomarkers in AD. In Supplement 1, we also discuss genetic and environmental risk factors for AD and exciting new analysis tools for the efficient evaluation of large-scale structural MRI data sets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data.  
23876085	The impact of neuroimmune changes on development of amyloid pathology; relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
Immunology  2014Mar
Neuroinflammatory changes are a characteristic of several, if not all, neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and are typified by increased microglial activation. Microglia express several receptors making them highly reactive and plastic cells, and, at least in vitro, they adopt different phenotypes in a manner analogous to their peripheral counterparts, macrophages. Microglia also express numerous cell surface proteins enabling them to interact with cells and the evidence indicates that maintenance of microglia in a quiescent state relies, at least to some extent, on an interaction with neurons by means of specific ligand-receptor pairs, for example CD200-CD200R. It is clear that microglia also interact with T cells and recent evidence indicates that co-incubation of microglia with T helper type 1 cells markedly increases their activation. Under normal conditions, small numbers of activated T cells gain entry to the brain and are involved in immune surveillance but infiltration of significant numbers of T cells occurs in disease and following injury. The consequences of T cell infiltration appear to depend on the conditions, with descriptions of both neurodestructive and neuroprotective effects in animal models of different diseases. This review will discuss the modulatory effect of T cells on microglia and the impact of infiltration of T cells into the brain with a focus on Alzheimer's disease, and will propose that infiltration of interferon-Î³-producing cells may be an important factor in triggering inflammation that is pathogenic and destructive. 
24696867	Flutemetamol (18F): a Î²-amyloid positron emission tomography tracer for Alzheimer's and dementia diagnosis.
Drugs Today  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease likely to dramatically increase in prevalence in the next few decades. Currently, the only method for definitive diagnosis is to determine the presence of Î²-amyloid in the brain of AD patients at autopsy. Flutemetamol (18F) (Vizamylâ„¢) is a novel (18)F-labeled radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET). Flutemetamol (18F) displays similar metabolism and dosimetry to the established amyloid PET imaging tracer (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B and other (18)F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, and is rapidly taken up into the brain and binds to Î²-amyloid deposits. Scans can be reliably quantified by the use of relative standard uptake value ratios, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. High sensitivity and specificity were demonstrated in phase III trials in discriminating between patients with AD and healthy controls and across a spectrum of AD, leading to the agent's approval to assist in the assessment of amyloid plaque pathology in AD patients.  
24461047	Galantamine treatment in outpatients with mild Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Neurol. Scand. 20140125 2014Jun
To assess long-term effectiveness of galantamine in community-dwelling persons with mild Alzheimer's disease. Prospective open-label trial including patients with mild AD (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) treated with galantamine for up to 36 months. Outcome parameters included ADAS-cog/11, Bayer-ADL scale (self- and caregivers' ratings), 10-item NPI and CGI-change, safety and tolerability measures. Data are presented based on ITT analyses (LOCF). Seventy-five patients (55% women; mean ADAS-cog 22.3; mean age 70.2 years) were treated with galantamine for approximately 36 months. About 60% (n=45) received a total daily dose of 24 mg galantamine at final visit. After 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment, mean improvements in ADAS-cog ranged between 2.2 and 3.0 points (all P&lt;0.05). After 24-month treatment, ADAS-cog returned to baseline value and at 3-year follow-up, patient deteriorated on average by 2.9 points. There was significant improvement on the NPI scale between baseline and 3- to 12-month follow-up (all P&lt;0.05) and at 3-year endpoint, a slight deterioration was noted. Activities of daily living (B-ADL) decreased significantly after 24 months in self-ratings and after 12 months in caregivers' ratings. Fifty-four patients reported at least one AE, most of them occurring during the first 2 years of treatment. Among the most frequently (&gt;10%) reported AEs irrespective of causal relationship to study medication were nausea (17.3%), dizziness (12%), and vomiting (10.7%). Galantamine was generally safe and well tolerated during the 3-year observation period. Cognition, behavior, and activities of daily living improved during 12 months treatment. At 3-year follow-up, worsening in all outcomes was measured; however, cognition remained improved compared with an untreated population. 
24506061	Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)/repetitive TMS in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Neurol. Scand. 20140208 2014Jun
Several Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) techniques can be applied to noninvasively measure cortical excitability and brain plasticity in humans. TMS has been used to assess neuroplastic changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), corroborating findings that cortical physiology is altered in AD due to the underlying neurodegenerative process. In fact, many TMS studies have provided physiological evidence of abnormalities in cortical excitability, connectivity, and plasticity in patients with AD. Moreover, the combination of TMS with other neurophysiological techniques, such as high-density electroencephalography (EEG), makes it possible to study local and network cortical plasticity directly. Interestingly, several TMS studies revealed abnormalities in patients with early AD and even with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), thus enabling early identification of subjects in whom the cholinergic degeneration has occurred. Furthermore, TMS can influence brain function if delivered repetitively; repetitive TMS (rTMS) is capable of modulating cortical excitability and inducing long-lasting neuroplastic changes. Preliminary findings have suggested that rTMS can enhance performances on several cognitive functions impaired in AD and MCI. However, further well-controlled studies with appropriate methodology in larger patient cohorts are needed to replicate and extend the initial findings. The purpose of this paper was to provide an updated and comprehensive systematic review of the studies that have employed TMS/rTMS in patients with MCI and AD.  
24711311	The long reach of Alzheimer's disease: patients, practice, and policy.
Health Aff (Millwood)  2014Apr
The impact of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias reaches well beyond the health care needs of the person with dementia. As dementia inexorably progresses, the patient becomes increasingly dependent on others for basic daily care and routine tasks, a physically safe environment, and protection from exploitation or abuse. Addressing the diverse medical and social care needs of the burgeoning US population with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias requires the adoption of a broad-based policy framework and agenda that explicitly acknowledge the complex and unique needs of people with dementia and the impacts of dementia on caregivers and society at large. Public policies related to social service providers, agencies that provide appropriate housing, financial and legal services, and law enforcement must complement other policies focused on prevention and risk reduction, effective treatment development, and efficient health care delivery.  
24711312	How are we going to live with Alzheimer's disease?
Health Aff (Millwood)  2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease confronts us with an ethical challenge: How do we live with dignity and quality of life in the face of progressive disability and, ultimately, death? Patients' cognitive and decision-making impairments often make them unable to answer this question, and when professionals who provide services for older adults fail to recognize and accommodate these impairments, patients suffer. Patients and their caregivers need a health care system that fosters caregiving so that each will live with dignity and well-being. Another way to answer this question is to discover treatments that prevent disabling cognitive impairments, but this strategy will require expanding the Alzheimer's label to include people who do not have dementia or who are even cognitively normal. Controversies are likely to occur over how best to describe the Alzheimer's problem, measure the value of early diagnosis and treatment, and live with a brain at risk.  
24711313	Unintended benefits: the potential economic impact of addressing risk factors to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
Health Aff (Millwood)  2014Apr
Certain chronic conditions appear to be modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. To understand the potential health and economic impacts of addressing those risk factors, we used data on a Medicare cohort to simulate four scenarios: a 10 percent reduction in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, respectively, and a 10 percent reduction in body mass index among beneficiaries who were overweight or obese. Our simulation demonstrated that reducing the prevalence of these conditions may yield "unintended benefits" by lowering the risk, delaying the onset, reducing the duration, and lowering the costs of dementia. More research is needed to clarify the exact relationship between various other chronic diseases and dementia. However, our findings highlight potential health gains and savings opportunities stemming from the better management of other conditions associated with dementia.  
24711314	The Alzheimer's Study Group's recommendations five years later: planning has advanced, but agenda remains unfinished.
Health Aff (Millwood)  2014Apr
Five years ago the Alzheimer's Study Group released its assessment and recommendations in a final report to the 111th Congress. Sobered by the burden of Alzheimer's and the anticipated trajectory of the disease, the Alzheimer's Study Group recommended the development of a rigorous research plan to be fully funded by Congress. Congress acted on the first of these recommendations by passing the National Alzheimer's Project Act, signed into law in 2011. The Department of Health and Human Services, in turn, released the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease in 2012. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) then followed in 2013 with a specific research program to achieve the national plan's goal to "prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025." With one of the Alzheimer's Study Group's recommendations fulfilled, the critical remaining questions are whether the NIH's Alzheimer's research program will be adequately funded and continue to be effectively executed so as to meet the 2025 goal.  
24711317	Obstacles and opportunities in Alzheimer's clinical trial recruitment.
Health Aff (Millwood)  2014Apr
The 2012 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease set an ambitious goal: to both prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To reach this goal, tens of thousands of volunteers will be needed to participate in clinical trials to test promising new interventions and therapies. To mobilize these volunteers and their health care providers to participate in future clinical trials, it will be necessary to achieve a better understanding of the barriers keeping people from participating in Alzheimer's research; form innovative partnerships among researchers, health care and social service providers, and the public; and develop more-effective outreach strategies. In this article we explore recruitment issues, including those unique to Alzheimer's studies, and we suggest concrete steps such as establishing a structured consortium linking all of the registries of Alzheimer's trials and establishing new partnerships with community and local organizations that can build trust and understanding among patients, caregivers, and providers.  
24711324	Redesigning systems of care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease.
Health Aff (Millwood)  2014Apr
Best-practice models of dementia care have evolved from strategies focused on family caregivers to guidelines predicated on supporting the patient-caregiver dyad along the care continuum. These models have grown in complexity to encompass medical and team-based care that is designed to coordinate dementia care across settings and providers for a defined population of patients. Although there is evidence that the models can improve outcomes, they have not been widely adopted. Barriers to the models' increased adoption include workforce limitations, the cost of necessary practice redesign, and limited evidence of their potential cost-effectiveness. We summarize the origins, evidence base, and common components of best-practice models of dementia care, and we discuss barriers to their implementation. We conclude by describing two current efforts to implement such models on a broad scale, supported by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Taken together, these models seek to demonstrate improved dementia care quality and outcomes, accompanied by cost savings, in both community-based and institutional care settings.  
24711325	Preparing the health care workforce to care for adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
Health Aff (Millwood)  2014Apr
In the United States, one in nine people ages sixty-five and older and one-third of people ages eighty-five and older have Alzheimer's disease. The number of cases of Alzheimer's disease is projected to triple by 2050, from 5.0 million in 2013 to 13.8 million. This will challenge the health care workforce, which is already inadequate in both size and training. We assessed what is likely to be an increasing shortage of physicians, nurses, and social workers with specialized training in geriatrics and, more specifically, in the care of people with dementia. We highlight the limited training of health care professionals in best practices of dementia care and chronic disease management. To address these shortfalls, we recommend the dissemination of team-based models of care that integrate health and social services; expansion of education loan forgiveness and faculty development programs to attract students into clinician-educator careers focusing on Alzheimer's disease; inclusion of curricula specific to the disease in all health professions training; expansion of federal programs to train existing workers; and increased compensation for the direct care workforce. 
24404923	Intranasal therapeutic strategies for management of Alzheimer's disease.
J Drug Target 20140109 2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive age-related irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that represents 70% of all dementia with 35 million cases worldwide. Successful treatment strategies for AD have so far been limited, and present therapy is based on cholinergic replacement therapy and inhibiting glutamate excitotoxicity. In this context, role of neuroprotective drugs has generated considerable interest in management of AD. Recently, direct intranasal (IN) delivery of drug moieties to the central nervous system (CNS) has emerged as a therapeutically viable alternative to oral and parenteral routes. IN delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier by delivering and targeting drugs to the CNS along the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathways which are in direct contact with both the environment and the CNS. In an attempt to understand how neurotherapeutics/nanoparticulate delivery systems can be transported from the nose to the CNS, the present review sets out to discuss the mechanism of transport from nose to brain. The aim of this review is to discuss and summarize the latest findings of some of the major studies on IN drug delivery in AD models, with a focus on the potential efficacy of neuroprotective treatments. 
24655894	IVIg protects the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease from memory deficit and AÎ² pathology.
J Neuroinflammation 20140322 2014
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is currently in clinical study for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, preclinical investigations are required to better understand AD-relevant outcomes of IVIg treatment and develop replacement therapies in case of unsustainable supply. We investigated the effects of IVIg in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, which reproduces both AÎ² and tau pathologies. Mice were injected twice weekly with 1.5Â g/kg IVIg for 1 or 3Â months. IVIg induced a modest but significant improvement in memory in the novel object recognition test and attenuated anxiety-like behavior in 3xTg-AD mice. We observed a correction of immunologic defects present in 3xTg-AD mice (-22% CD4/CD8 blood ratio; -17% IL-5/IL-10 ratio in the cortex) and a modulation of CX3CR1+ cell population (-13% in the bone marrow). IVIg treatment led to limited effects on tau pathology but resulted in a 22% reduction of the soluble AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio and a 60% decrease in concentrations of 56Â kDa AÎ² oligomers (AÎ²*56). The memory-enhancing effect of IVIg reported here suggests that AÎ² oligomers, effector T cells and the fractalkine pathway are potential pharmacological targets of IVIg in AD. 
24694234	RIG-1 receptor expression in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.
J Neuroinflammation 20140402 2014
Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and involves activation of the innate immune response via recognition of diverse stimuli by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The inflammatory inducers and precise innate signaling pathway contributing to AD pathology remain largely undefined. In the present study we analyzed expression levels of innate immune proteins in temporal and occipital cortices from preclinical (no cognitive impairment, NCI, Nâ€‰=â€‰22) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI, Nâ€‰=â€‰20) associated with AD pathology (Nâ€‰=â€‰20) and AD patients (Nâ€‰=â€‰23). We found that retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-1) is significantly elevated in the temporal cortex and plasma in patients with MCI. In addition, primary human astrocytes stimulated with the RIG-1 ligand 5'ppp RNA showed increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), supporting the idea that RIG-1 is involved in the pathology of MCI associated with early progression to AD. These findings suggest that RIG-1 may play a critical role in incipient AD. 
24105806	Hippocampal shape analysis in Alzheimer's disease using functional data analysis.
Stat Med 20130916 2014Feb28
The hippocampus is one of the first affected regions in Alzheimer's disease. The left hippocampi of control subjects, patients with mild cognitive impairment and patients with Alzheimer's disease are represented by spherical harmonics. Functional data analysis is used in the hippocampal shape analysis. Functional principal component analysis and functional independent component analysis are defined for multivariate functions with two arguments. A functional linear discriminant function is also defined. Comparisons with other approaches are carried out. Our functional approach gives promising results, especially in shape classification. 
24568585	Human CDC2-like kinase 1 (CLK1): a novel target for Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Drug Targets  2014May
The cdc2-like kinases (CLKs) are an evolutionarily conserved group of dual specificity kinases belonging to the CMGC (cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases), glycogen synthase kinases (GSK) and CDK-like kinases). The CLK family consists of four isoforms namely CLK1, CLK2, CLK3 and CLK4. The human CLK1 encoded protein comprises 454 amino acids and the catalytic domain of CLK1 exhibits the typical protein kinase fold. CLK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues and phosphorylate exogenous substrates on serine and threonine residues. CLK1 plays an important role in the regulation of RNA splicing through phosphorylation of members of the serine and arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors. CLK1 is involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease by phosphorylating the serine residue in SR proteins. Nuclear speckles of the nucleoplasm contain the stored form of SR proteins and are moderately responsible for the choice of splicing sites during pre-mRNA splicing. Hence, the inhibition of CLK1 can be used as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Many natural and synthetic molecules are reported to possess CLK1 inhibitory activity. Some specific examples are Marine alkaloid Leucettamine B and KH-CB19. Leucettamine B is a potent inhibitor of CLK1 (15 nM), Dyrk1A (40 nM), and Dyrk2 (35 nM) and a moderate inhibitor of CLK3 (4.5 ÂµM) whereas KH-CB19 is a highly specific and potent inhibitor of the CLK1/CLK4. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed the binding mode of marine sponge metabolite hymenialdisine and a dichloroindolyl enamino nitrile (KH-CB19) to CLK1. This review focuses on the role of CLKs in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and therapeutic potential of targeting CLK1 in Alzheimer's disease drug discovery and development. In addition, the recent developments in drug discovery efforts targeting human CLK1 are also highlighted.  
24712999	Tau acts as a mediator for Alzheimer's disease-related synaptic deficits.
Eur. J. Neurosci.  2014Apr
The two histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid plaques containing multiple forms of amyloid beta (AÎ²) and neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau proteins. As mild cognitive impairment frequently occurs long before the clinical diagnosis of AD, the scientific community has been increasingly interested in the roles of AÎ² and tau in earlier cellular changes that lead to functional deficits. Therefore, great progress has recently been made in understanding how AÎ² or tau causes synaptic dysfunction. However, the interaction between the AÎ² and tau-initiated intracellular cascades that lead to synaptic dysfunction remains elusive. The cornerstone of the two-decade-old hypothetical amyloid cascade model is that amyloid pathologies precede tau pathologies. Although the premise of AÎ²-tau pathway remains valid, the model keeps evolving as new signaling events are discovered that lead to functional deficits and neurodegeneration. Recent progress has been made in understanding AÎ²-PrP(C) -Fyn-mediated neurotoxicity and synaptic deficits. Although still elusive, many novel upstream and downstream signaling molecules have been found to modulate tau mislocalization and tau hyperphosphorylation. Here we will discuss the mechanistic interactions between AÎ²-PrP(C) -mediated neurotoxicity and tau-mediated synaptic deficits in an updated amyloid cascade model with calcium and tau as the central mediators.  
24715293	Immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease: DNA- and protein-based epitope vaccines.
Methods Mol. Biol.  2014
Active immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is aimed to induce antibodies specific to amyloid-beta (AÎ²) that are capable to reduce the level of AÎ² in the CNS of Alzheimer's disease patients. First clinical trial AN-1792 that was based on vaccination with full-length AÎ²42 showed that safe and effective AD vaccine should induce high titers of anti-AÎ² antibodies without activation of harmful autoreactive T cells. Replacement of self-T cell epitope with foreign epitope, keeping self-B cell epitope intact, may allow to induce high titers of anti-AÎ² antibodies while avoiding the activation of T cells specific to AÎ². Here we describe the protocols for evaluation of AD DNA- or multiple antigenic peptide (MAP)-based epitope vaccines composed of AÎ²(1-11) B cell epitope fused to synthetic T cell epitope PADRE (AÎ²(1-11)-PADRE). All protocols could be used for testing any epitope vaccine constructed in your lab and composed of other T cell epitopes using the appropriate peptides in tests for evaluation of humoral and cellular immune responses. 
24818077	Parallel ICA of FDG-PET and PiB-PET in three conditions with underlying Alzheimer's pathology.
Neuroimage Clin 20140319 2014
The relationships between clinical phenotype, Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) deposition and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are incompletely understood yet have important ramifications for future therapy. The goal of this study was to utilize multimodality positron emission tomography (PET) data from a clinically heterogeneous population of patients with probable AD in order to: (1) identify spatial patterns of AÎ² deposition measured by ((11)C)-labeledÂ Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET) and glucose metabolism measured by FDG-PET that correlate with specific clinical presentation and (2) explore associations between spatial patterns of AÎ² deposition and glucose metabolism across the AD population. We included all patients meetingÂ the criteria for probable AD (NIA-AA) who had undergone MRI, PiB and FDG-PET at our center (NÂ =Â 46, mean age 63.0Â Â±Â 7.7, Mini-Mental State Examination 22.0Â Â±Â 4.8). Patients were subclassified based on their cognitive profiles into an amnestic/dysexecutive group (AD-memory; nÂ =Â 27), a language-predominant group (AD-language; nÂ =Â 10) and a visuospatial-predominant group (AD-visuospatial; nÂ =Â 9). All patients were required to have evidence of amyloid deposition on PiB-PET. To capture the spatial distribution of AÎ² deposition and glucose metabolism, we employed parallel independentÂ component analysis (pICA), a method that enables joint analyses of multimodal imaging data. The relationships between PET components and clinical group were examined using aÂ Receiver Operator Characteristic approach, including age, gender, education and apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele carrier status as covariates. Results of the first set of analyses independently examining the relationship between components from each modality and clinical group showed three significant components for FDG: a left inferior frontal and temporoparietal component associated with AD-language (areaÂ under the curve [AUC] 0.82, pÂ =Â 0.011), and two components associated with AD-visuospatial (bilateral occipito-parieto-temporal [AUC 0.85, pÂ =Â 0.009] and right posterior cingulate cortex [PCC]/precuneus and right lateral parietal [AUC 0.69, pÂ =Â 0.045]). The AD-memory associated component included predominantly bilateral inferior frontal, cuneus and inferior temporal, and right inferior parietal hypometabolism but did not reach significance (AUC 0.65, pÂ =Â 0.062). None of the PiB components correlated with clinical group. Joint analysis of PiB and FDG with pICA revealed a correlated component pair, in whichÂ increased frontal and decreased PCC/precuneus PiB correlated with decreased FDG in the frontal, occipital and temporal regions (partial rÂ =Â 0.75, pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Using multivariate data analysis, this study reinforced the notion that clinical phenotype in AD is tightly linked to patterns of glucose hypometabolism but not amyloid deposition. These findings are strikingly similar to those of univariate paradigms and provide additional support in favor of specific involvement of the language network, higher-order visual network, and default mode network in clinical variants of AD. The inverse relationship between AÎ² deposition and glucose metabolism in partially overlapping brain regions suggests that AÎ² may exert both local and remote effects on brain metabolism. Applying multivariate approaches such as pICA to multimodal imaging data is a promising approach for unraveling the complex relationships between different elements of AD pathophysiology.  
24271328	Arteriolosclerosis that affects multiple brain regions is linked to hippocampal sclerosis of ageing.
Brain 20131121 2014Jan
Hippocampal sclerosis of ageing is a prevalent brain disease that afflicts older persons and has been linked with cerebrovascular pathology. Arteriolosclerosis is a subtype of cerebrovascular pathology characterized by concentrically thickened arterioles. Here we report data from multiple large autopsy series (University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Centre, Nun Study, and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre) showing a specific association between hippocampal sclerosis of ageing pathology and arteriolosclerosis. The present analyses incorporate 226 cases of autopsy-proven hippocampal sclerosis of ageing and 1792 controls. Case-control comparisons were performed including digital pathological assessments for detailed analyses of blood vessel morphology. We found no evidence of associations between hippocampal sclerosis of ageing pathology and lacunar infarcts, large infarcts, Circle of Willis atherosclerosis, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Individuals with hippocampal sclerosis of ageing pathology did not show increased rates of clinically documented hypertension, diabetes, or other cardiac risk factors. The correlation between arteriolosclerosis and hippocampal sclerosis of ageing pathology was strong in multiple brain regions outside of the hippocampus. For example, the presence of arteriolosclerosis in the frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) was strongly associated with hippocampal sclerosis of ageing pathology (P &lt; 0.001). This enables informative evaluation of anatomical regions outside of the hippocampus. To assess the morphology of brain microvasculature far more rigorously than what is possible using semi-quantitative pathological scoring, we applied digital pathological (Aperio ScanScope) methods on a subsample of frontal cortex sections from hippocampal sclerosis of ageing (n = 15) and control (n = 42) cases. Following technical studies to optimize immunostaining methods for small blood vessel visualization, our analyses focused on sections immunostained for smooth muscle actin (a marker of arterioles) and CD34 (an endothelial marker), with separate analyses on grey and white matter. A total of 43 834 smooth muscle actin-positive vascular profiles and 603 798 CD34-positive vascular profiles were evaluated. In frontal cortex of cases with hippocampal sclerosis of ageing, smooth muscle actin-immunoreactive arterioles had thicker walls (P &lt; 0.05), larger perimeters (P &lt; 0.03), and larger vessel areas (P &lt; 0.03) than controls. Unlike the arterioles, CD34-immunoreactive capillaries had dimensions that were unchanged in cases with hippocampal sclerosis of ageing versus controls. Arteriolosclerosis appears specific to hippocampal sclerosis of ageing brains, because brains with Alzheimer's disease pathology did not show the same morphological alterations. We conclude that there may be a pathogenetic change in aged human brain arterioles that impacts multiple brain areas and contributes to hippocampal sclerosis of ageing.  
24363250	Thapsigargin affects presenilin-2 but not presenilin-1 regulation in SK-N-BE cells.
Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood) 20131220 2014Feb
Presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) are transmembrane proteins widely expressed in the central nervous system, which function as the catalytic subunits of Î³-secretase, the enzyme that releases amyloid-Î² protein (AÎ²) from ectodomain cleaved amyloid precursor protein (APP) by intramembrane proteolysis. Mutations in PS1, PS2, and AÎ² protein precursor are involved in the etiology of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), while the cause of the sporadic form of AD (SAD) is still not known. However, since similar neuropathological changes have been observed in both FAD and SAD, a common pathway in the etiology of the disease has been suggested. Given that age-related deranged Ca(2+) regulation has been hypothesized to play a role in SAD pathogenesis via PS gene regulation and Î³-secretase activity, we studied the in vitro regulation of PS1 and PS2 in the human neuron-like SK-N-BE cell line treated with the specific endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium ATPase inhibitor Thapsigargin (THG), to introduce intracellular Ca(2+) perturbations and mimic the altered Ca(2+) homeostasis observed in AD. Our results showed a consistent and significant down-regulation of PS2, while PS1 appeared to be unmodulated. These events were accompanied by oxidative stress and a number of morphological alterations suggestive of the induction of apoptotic machinery. The administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) did not revert the THG-induced effects reported, while treatment with the Ca(2+)-independent ER stressor Brefeldin A did not modulate basal PS1 and PS2 expression. Collectively, these results suggest that Ca(2+) fluctuation rather than ER stress and/or oxidative imbalance seems to play an essential role in PS2 regulation and confirm that, despite their strong homology, PS1 and PS2 could play different roles in AD. 
24529520	The nature, significance, and glucagon-like peptide-1 analog treatment of brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease leading over the course of decades to the most common form of dementia. Many of its pathologic features and cognitive deficits may be due in part to brain insulin resistance recently demonstrated in the insulin receptorâ†’insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) signaling pathway. The proximal cause of such resistance in AD dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) appears to be serine inhibition of IRS-1, a phenomenon likely due to microglial release of inflammatory cytokines triggered by oligomeric AÎ². Studies on animal models of AD and on human brain tissue from MCI cases at high risk of AD dementia have shown that brain insulin resistance and many other pathologic features and symptoms of AD may be greatly reduced or even reversed by treatment with FDA-approved glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs such as liraglutide (Victoza). These findings call attention to the need for further basic, translational, and clinical studies on GLP-1 analogs as promising AD therapeutics.  
24164423	CaMKII activity is essential for improvement of memory-related behaviors by chronic rivastigmine treatment.
J. Neurochem. 20131117 2014Mar
Because the cholinergic system is down-regulated in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease patients are significantly improved by rivastigmine treatment. To address the mechanism underlying rivastigmine-induced memory improvements, we chronically treated olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice with rivastigmine. The chronic rivastigmine treatments for 12-13 days starting at 10 days after OBX operation significantly improved memory-related behaviors assessed by Y-maze task, novel object recognition task, passive avoidance task, and Barnes maze task, whereas the single rivastigmine treatment failed to improve the memory. Consistent with the improved memory-related behaviors, long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region was markedly restored by rivastigmine treatments. In immunoblotting analyses, the reductions of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) phosphorylation in the CA1 region in OBX mice were significantly restored by rivastigmine treatments. In addition, phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) (Ser-831) and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (Ser-133) as downstream targets of CaMKII and CaMKIV, respectively, in the CA1 region was also significantly restored by chronic rivastigmine treatments. Finally, we confirmed that rivastigmine-induced improvements of memory-related behaviors and long-term potentiation were not obtained in CaMKIIÎ±(+/-) mice. On the other hand, CaMKIV(-/-) mice did not exhibit the cognitive impairments. Taken together, the stimulation of CaMKII activity in the hippocampus is essential for rivastigmine-induced memory improvement in OBX mice. 
24467889	The cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective taking between conversational partners: evidence from speakers with Alzheimer×³s disease.
Neuropsychologia 20140124 2014Apr
Successful communication requires speakers to consider their listeners×³ perspectives. Little is known about how this ability changes in Alzheimer×³s Disease (AD) although such knowledge could reveal the cognitive mechanisms fundamental to perspective-taking ability, and reveal which cognitive deficits are fundamental to communication disorders in AD. Patients with mild to moderate AD and age and education matched controls were tested in a communicative perspective-taking task, and on measures of executive control, general cognitive functioning, and lexical retrieval. Patients×³ ability to perform the perspective-taking task was significantly correlated with performance on measures of general cognitive functioning, visual scanning and construction, response conflict and attention. Measures of lexical retrieval tended not to be correlated with performance on the communication task with one exception: semantic but not letter fluency predicted a derived score of perspective-taking ability. These findings broaden our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective taking, and suggest that impairments in perspective taking in AD occur during utterance planning, and at a relatively early processing stage which involves rapid visual scanning and problem solving, rather than during retrieval of lexical items needed to speak. More broadly, these data reveal executive function and semantic deficits, but not problems with lexical retrieval, as more fundamental to the basis of cognitive changes associated with AD. 
24667337	Mortality from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementias in France and Italy: a comparison using the multiple cause-of-death approach.
J Aging Health  2014Mar
We perform an in-depth analysis of all death certificates collected in France and Italy with an entry of Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), or another dementia. Data are for 2008. We measure how frequently these conditions are the underlying cause of death. We then examine what other causes are reported on the certificates. In both countries, AD is the underlying cause for about 6 in 10 certificates with an AD entry. The proportion is lower for PD and dementia, but higher in France than in Italy. Many contributing causes reflect the circumstances surrounding the end of life in AD, PD, and dementia, often characterized by bed confinement and frailty. Our research highlights several consequences of the conditions under study that could be targeted by public health policy. It also speaks to the existence of differences in diagnosis/certification practices that may explain differences in mortality levels. 
24508505	High-density lipoproteins and cerebrovascular integrity in Alzheimer's disease.
Cell Metab. 20140206 2014Apr1
Cerebrovascular dysfunction significantly contributes to the clinical presentation and pathoetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deposition and aggregation of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) within vascular smooth muscle cells leads to inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired vasorelaxation, and disruption of blood-brain barrier integrity. Midlife vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, increase the relative risk for AD. These comorbidities are all characterized by low and/or dysfunctional high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which itself is a risk factor for AD. HDL performs a wide variety of critical functions in the periphery and CNS. In addition to lipid transport, HDL regulates vascular health via mediating vasorelaxation, inflammation, and oxidative stress and promotes endothelial cell survival and integrity. Here, we summarize clinical and preclinical data examining the involvement of HDL, originating from the circulation and from within the CNS, on AD and hypothesize potential synergistic actions between the two lipoprotein pools.  
24657052	Quinolone-benzylpiperidine derivatives as novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and antioxidant hybrids for Alzheimer disease.
Bioorg. Med. Chem. 20140307 2014Apr15
Design, synthesis and evaluation of new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors by combining quinolinecarboxamide to a benzylpiperidine moiety are described. Then, a series of hybrids have been developed by introducing radical scavengers. Molecular modeling was performed and structure activity relationships are discussed. Among the series, most potent compounds show effective AchE inhibitions, high selectivities over butyrylcholinesterase and high radical scavenging activities. On the basis of this work, the ability of quinolone derivatives to serve in the design of N-benzylpiperidine linked multipotent molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer Disease has been established.  
24514874	In vivo evaluation of a novel tau imaging tracer for Alzheimer's disease.
Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 20140211 2014May
Diagnosis of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) still relies on post-mortem examination of the human brain. A non-invasive method of determining brain tau burden in vivo would allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of tauopathies. The purpose of the study was to evaluate (18)F-THK523 as a potential tau imaging tracer. Ten healthy elderly controls, three semantic dementia (SD) and ten AD patients underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI as well as (18)F-THK523 and (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Composite memory and non-memory scores, global and hippocampal brain volume, and partial volume-corrected tissue ratios for (18)F-THK523 and (11)C-PIB were estimated for all participants. Correlational analyses were performed between global and regional (18)F-THK523, (11)C-PIB, cognition and brain volumetrics. (18)F-THK523 presented with fast reversible kinetics. Significantly higher (18)F-THK523 retention was observed in the temporal, parietal, orbitofrontal and hippocampi of AD patients when compared to healthy controls and SD patients. White matter retention was significantly higher than grey matter retention in all participants. The pattern of cortical (18)F-THK523 retention did not correlate with AÎ² distribution as assessed by (11)C-PIB and followed the known distribution of tau in the AD brain, being higher in temporal and parietal areas than in the frontal region. Unlike (11)C-PIB, hippocampal (18)F-THK523 retention was correlated with several cognitive parameters and with hippocampal atrophy. (18)F-THK523 does not bind to AÎ² in vivo, while following the known distribution of paired helical filaments (PHF)-tau in the brain. Significantly higher cortical (18)F-THK523 retention in AD patients as well as the association of hippocampal (18)F-THK523 retention with cognitive parameters and hippocampal volume suggests (18)F-THK523 selectively binds to tau in AD patients. Unfortunately, the very high (18)F-THK523 retention in white matter precludes simple visual inspection of the images, preventing its use in research or clinical settings. 
24523481	Brain imaging of cognitively normal individuals with 2 parents affected by late-onset AD.
Neurology 20140212 2014Mar4
This brain imaging study examines whether cognitively normal (NL) individuals with 2 parents affected by late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) show evidence of more extensive Alzheimer disease pathology compared with those who have a single parent affected by LOAD. Fifty-two NL individuals received MRI, (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET, and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. These included 4 demographically balanced groups (n = 13/group, aged 32-72 years, 60% female, 30% APOE Îµ4 carriers) of NL individuals with maternal (FHm), paternal (FHp), and maternal and paternal (FHmp) family history of LOAD, and with negative family history (FH-). Statistical parametric mapping, voxel-based morphometry, and z-score mapping were used to compare MRI gray matter volumes (GMVs), partial volume-corrected PiB retention, and FDG metabolism across FH groups and vs FH-. NL FHmp showed more severe abnormalities in all 3 biomarkers vs the other groups regarding the number of regions affected and magnitude of impairment. PiB retention and hypometabolism were most pronounced in FHmp, intermediate in FHm, and lowest in FHp and FH-. GMV reductions were highest in FHmp and intermediate in FHm and FHp vs FH-. In all FH+ groups, amyloid-Î² deposition exceeded GMV loss and hypometabolism exceeded GMV loss (p &lt; 0.001), while amyloid-Î² deposition exceeded hypometabolism in FHmp and FHp but not in FHm. These biomarker findings show a "LOAD parent-dose effect" in NL individuals several years, if not decades, before possible clinical symptoms. 
24692443	Don't forget non-Alzheimer dementias.
Cleve Clin J Med  2014Apr
Dementia is commonly encountered in the elderly, with prevalence increasing with age. Although Alzheimer disease is the most recognized form of dementia, other types have distinct clinical features and are often overlooked. Proper identification aids patients, caregivers, and physicians in planning and management.  
24685003	Changes in cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma levels of IGF-II and its binding proteins in Alzheimer's disease: an observational study.
BMC Neurol 20140401 2014
The Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-related system is implicated in neuroregeneration and cell repair, as well as regulating lifespan. IGF-II, one component of this system, has also been found to affect memory functions in a rat model. In this study we explored changes in the IGF-related system in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including changes in IGF-II levels. We measured blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 in 72 healthy controls and 92 patients with AD. We found significantly lower blood plasma levels of IGF-II and IGFBP-3 in patients with AD, compared with controls. The levels of IGF-II and IGFBP-2 were significantly elevated in the CSF from patients with AD. We also found correlations between established CSF biomarkers for AD (tau and P-tau) and components of the IGF system. CSF and blood plasma levels of IGF-II and some of its binding proteins are changed in patients with AD. Further investigation into this area may unravel important clues to the nature of this disease. 
24433704	Discerning mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer Disease from normal aging: morphologic characterization based on univariate and multivariate models.
Acad Radiol 20140113 2014May
Differentiating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer Disease (AD) from healthy aging remains challenging. This study aimed to explore the cerebral structural alterations of subjects with MCI or AD as compared to healthy elderly based on the individual and collective effects of cerebral morphologic indices using univariate and multivariate analyses. T1-weighted images (T1WIs) were retrieved from Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database for 116 subjects who were categorized into groups of healthy aging, MCI, and AD. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) were performed to explore the intergroup morphologic alterations indexed by surface area, curvature index, cortical thickness, and subjacent white matter volume with age and sex controlled as covariates, in 34 parcellated gyri regions of interest (ROIs) for both cerebral hemispheres based on the T1WI. Statistical parameters were mapped on the anatomic images to facilitate visual inspection. Global rather than region-specific structural alterations were revealed in groups of MCI and AD relative to healthy elderly using MANCOVA. ANCOVA revealed that the cortical thickness decreased more prominently in entorhinal, temporal, and cingulate cortices and was positively correlated with patients' cognitive performance in AD group but not in MCI. The temporal lobe features marked atrophy of white matter during the disease dynamics. Significant intercorrelations were observed among the morphologic indices with univariate analysis for given ROIs. Significant global structural alterations were identified in MCI and AD based on MANCOVA model with improved sensitivity. The intercorrelation among the morphologic indices may dampen the use of individual morphological parameter in featuring cerebral structural alterations. Decrease in cortical thickness is not reflective of the cognitive performance at the early stage of AD. 
24414091	Cingulum correlates of cognitive functions in patients with mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease: a diffusion spectrum imaging study.
Brain Topogr 20140111 2014May
Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) of MRI can detect neural fiber tract changes. We investigated integrity of cingulum bundle (CB) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (EAD) using DSI tractography and explored its relationship with cognitive functions. We recruited 8 patients with MCI, 9 with EAD and 15 healthy controls (HC). All subjects received a battery of neuropsychological tests to access their executive, memory and language functions. We used a 3.0-tesla MRI scanner to obtain T1- and T2-weighted images for anatomy and used a pulsed gradient twice-refocused spin-echo diffusion echo-planar imaging sequence to acquire DSI. Patients with EAD performed significantly poorer than the HC on most tests in executive and memory functions. Significantly smaller general fractional anisotropy (GFA) values were found in the posterior and inferior segments of left CB and of the anterior segment of right CB of the EAD compared with those of the HC. Spearman's correlation on the patient groups showed that GFA values of the posterior segment of the left CB were significantly negatively associated with the time used to complete Color Trails Test Part II and positively correlated with performance of the logical memory and visual reproduction. GFA values of inferior segment of bilateral CB were positively associated with the performance of visual recognition. DSI tractography demonstrates significant preferential degeneration of the CB on the left side in patients with EAD. The location-specific degeneration is associated with corresponding declines in both executive and memory functions.  
23930978	Microglia, neuroinflammation, and beta-amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Neurosci. 20130912 2014May
Compelling evidence from basic molecular biology has demonstrated the dual roles of microglia in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On one hand, microglia are involved in AD pathogenesis by releasing inflammatory mediators such as inflammatory cytokines, complement components, chemokines, and free radicals that are all known to contribute to beta-amyloid (AÎ²) production and accumulation. On the other hand, microglia are also known to play a beneficial role in generating anti-AÎ² antibodies and stimulating clearance of amyloid plaques. AÎ² itself, an inducer of microglia activation and neuroinflammation, has been considered as an underlying and unifying factor in the development of AD. A vicious cycle of inflammation has been formed between AÎ² accumulation, activated microglia, and microglial inflammatory mediators, which enhance AÎ² deposition and neuroinflammation. Thus, inhibiting the vicious cycle seems to be a promising treatment to restrain further development of AD. With increasing research efforts on microglia in AD, intervention of microglia activation and neuroinflammation in AD may provide a potential target for AD therapy in spite of the provisional failure of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in clinical trials.  
24524963	BRI2-BRICHOS is increased in human amyloid plaques in early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140113 2014Jul
BRI2 protein binds amyloid precursor protein to halt amyloid-Î² production and inhibits amyloid-Î² aggregation via its BRICHOS-domain suggesting a link between BRI2 and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate the possible involvement of BRI2 in human AD pathogenesis. BRI2 containing BRICHOS-domain was increased up to 3-fold in AD hippocampus (p = 0.003, n = 14/group). Immunohistochemistry showed BRI2 deposits associated with amyloid-Î² plaques in early pathologic stages (Braak-III; Thal-2/3). We observed a decrease in the protein levels of ADAM10 (p = 0.02) and furin (p = 0.066), as well as an increase in SPPL2b (p &lt; 0.0001) in AD hippocampus. Because these enzymes are involved in BRI2 processing, their changes may lead to aberrant processing of BRI2 promoting its deposition and likely affecting BRI2 function. Loss of BRI2 function in AD was supported by the decreased presence of BRI2-amyloid precursor protein complexes in the hippocampus of AD patients compared with control subjects. In conclusion, our data obtained from human samples indicate that in early stages of AD there is an increased deposition of BRI2, which likely leads to impaired BRI2 function thereby influencing AD pathophysiology. 
24524966	Plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) reduces neuropathologic hallmarks and improves cognitive functions in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140117 2014Jul
Impaired growth factor function is thought to drive many of the alterations observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Endogenous regenerative technology, PRGF (plasma rich in growth factor)-Endoret, is designed for the delivery of a complex pool of patient's own active morphogens that may stimulate tissue regeneration. We obtained and characterized PRGF-Endoret preparations from human blood. We used, as experimental approach in vivo, APP/PS1 mice, characterized by age-dependent brain amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) accumulation. Intranasal administration of PRGF-Endoret to APP/PS1 mice resulted in an important decrease in brain AÎ² deposition and tau phosphorylation. PRGF-Endoret-treated APP/PS1 mice also showed decreased astrocyte reactivity, and prevented protein synaptic loss. In vitro approaches demonstrated that PRGF-Endoret treatment modulated astrocyte activation, reducing inflammatory responses, and promoted AÎ² degradation. Furthermore, PRGF-Endoret stimulated global improvements in anxiety, learning, and memory behaviors. Our findings show that PRGF-Endoret exerts multifunctional and complementary effects that result in the reversal of the broad range of cognitive deficits in AD, suggesting that PRGF-Endoret may hold promise as an innovative therapy in AD. 
24529499	Investigation of an amyloid precursor protein protective mutation (A673T) in a North American case-control sample of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140123 2014Jul
A rare amyloid precursor protein gene variant, A673T (rs63750847) was recently reported to protect against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline among Icelanders and the same rare variant was observed also in Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish populations. We investigated this variant in 1674 late-onset Alzheimer's disease cases and 2644 elderly control subjects, all North American Whites (US Whites). We did not observe any example of the A673T variant in our large sample. Our findings suggest that this rare variant could be specific to the individuals of the origin from the Nordic countries.  
24559647	Detecting gene mutations in Japanese Alzheimer's patients by semiconductor sequencing.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140125 2014Jul
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. To date, several genes have been identified as the cause of AD, including PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP. The association between APOE and late-onset AD has also been reported. We here used a bench top next-generation sequencer, which uses an integrated semiconductor device, detects hydrogen ions, and operates at a high-speed using nonoptical technology. We examined 45 Japanese AD patients with positive family histories, and 29 sporadic patients with early onset (&lt;60-year-old). Causative mutations were detected in 5 patients in the familial group (11%). Three patients had a known heterozygous missense mutation in the PSEN1 gene (p.H163R). Two patients from 1 family had a novel heterozygous missense mutation in the PSEN1 gene (p.F386L). In the early onset group, 1 patient carrying homozygous APOEÎµ4 had a novel heterozygous missense mutation in the PSEN2 gene (p.T421M). Approximately 43% patients were APOEÎµ4 positive in our study. This new sequencing technology is useful for detecting genetic variations in familial AD.  
24582639	Genetic variation in BIN1 gene and Alzheimer's disease risk in Han Chinese individuals.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140206 2014Jul
Genome-wide association studies have identified the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) gene as the most important genetic susceptibility locus in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) after apolipoprotein E for individuals of European ancestry. To further characterize this association and to isolate the variants within BIN1 contributing to LOAD in Han Chinese individuals, we conducted a 2-step design study in our cohort of 1133 LOAD patients and 1159 control subjects. Sequencing analysis identified 44 variants within BIN1. Follow-up genotyping analysis revealed that a novel missense mutation P318L appeared to exert risk effect for development of LOAD; and rs67327804 was also significantly associated with LOAD risk even after adjusting for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E Îµ4 status. Haplotype analysis confirmed that the "GA" haplotype derived from single-nucleotide polymorphisms in rs67327804 and rs1060743 showed a 1.4-fold increased risk of LOAD. Our findings provided the first independent evidence that variants in BIN1 were significantly associated with LOAD in Han Chinese individuals.  
24690253	Evaluation of coexistence of Alzheimer's disease in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus using ELISA analyses for CSF biomarkers.
BMC Neurol 20140401 2014
We investigated levels of the Î²-amyloid 1-42 (AÎ²42), total tau protein (T-tau) and tau phosphorylated at position threonine 181 (P-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients and tried to find their clinical implications in the evaluation and treatment of iNPH. Twenty-five possible iNPH patients were prospectively enrolled and their CSF was collected to analyze levels of AÎ²42, T-tau and P-tau using ELISA method. Gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment were semi-quantified and detailed neuropsychological (NP) test was performed. Eight iNPH patients were classified into the lower CSF AÎ²42 group and 17 patients were classified into the higher CSF AÎ²42 group. There was no difference in the iNPH grading score and its improvement after LP between the two groups. The lower CSF AÎ²42 group showed more deficits in attention, visuospatial function and verbal memory in the baseline NP test and less improvement in phonemic categorical naming and frontal inhibitory function after LP. Our study suggested that concomitant AD in iNPH patients might contribute to lumbar puncture or shunt unresponsiveness, especially in the field of cognitive dysfunction. 
24720852	Donepezil and life expectancy in Alzheimer's disease: a retrospective analysis in the Tajiri Project.
BMC Neurol 20140411 2014
Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) such as donepezil have the effect of delaying progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their effect on life expectancy is unclear. We analyzed the influence of donepezil on life expectancy after onset of AD, together with the effects of antipsychotic drugs and residency in a nursing home. All outpatients at the Tajiri Clinic from 1999-2012 with available medical records and death certificates were included in a retrospective analysis. The entry criteria were a dementia diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria and diagnosis of AD using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria; medical treatment for more than 3 months; and follow up until less than 1 year before death. We identified 390 subjects with medical records and death certificates, of whom 275 had a diagnosis of dementia that met the entry criteria. Of 100 patients diagnosed with AD, 52 had taken donepezil and 48 patients had not received the drug due to treatment prior to the introduction of donepezil in 1999 in Japan. The lifetime expectancies after onset were 7.9 years in the donepezil group and 5.3 years in the non-donepezil group. There was a significant drug effect with a significant covariate effect of nursing home residency. Other covariates did not reach a significant level. Although this report has the limitation of all retrospective analyses: the lack of randomization, we found a positive effect of donepezil on lifetime expectancy after onset of AD. This may be due to a decreased mortality rate caused by reduction of concomitant diseases such as pneumonia. The similar life expectancies in patients taking donepezil at home and those not taking donepezil in a nursing home indicated a positive health economic effect of the drug. 
24023380	Effects of spaced retrieval training on semantic memory in Alzheimerâ€™s disease: a systematic review.
J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res.  2014Feb
This article reports on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of spaced retrieval training (SRT) on semantic memory in people with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) or related disorder. An initial systematic database search identified 454 potential studies. After screening and de-duplication, 35 studies that used SRT with the population of interest remained. The authors used an appraisal point system to evaluate the quality of the studies. Twelve of the 35 studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria and passed the appraisal point system cutoff. The 12 studies were classified as Level I and II evidence. Although the 12 studies varied in terms of design, methodology, and quality, SRT was shown to have important positive effects on learning semantic information across the included studies. The findings indicate that SRT is an effective semantic memory training technique for people with AD, and consequently, recommendations are suggested for implementing SRT in practice settings. Continued research in this domain is also warranted to address limitations and gaps in the current body of research evidence, including variability in SRT protocols, effects of dementia severity on learning outcomes, maintenance effects, generalization, and the role of explicit and implicit learning in SRT. 
23962708	Competitive electrochemical immunoassay for detection of Î²-amyloid (1-42) and total Î²-amyloid peptides using p-aminophenol redox cycling.
Biosens Bioelectron 20130801 2014Jan15
Î²-Amyloid (1-42) peptide (AÎ²(1-42)) is believed to be important for diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) serving as a reliable molecular biomarker. However, the levels of AÎ²(1-42) may differ by gender and age; thus, assay of AÎ²(1-42) only might be unable to discriminate between AD and health or other types of dementia. In this work, we reported a sensitive and selective electrochemical method for detection of both AÎ²(1-42) and total AÎ² using p-aminophenol (p-AP) redox cycling on antibody-modified gold electrodes. Specifically, the conjugates performed between streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (SA-ALP) and biotinylated AÎ² peptides were captured by the antibody-modified electrodes, which induced the production of electrochemically active p-AP from the p-aminophenyl phosphate (p-APP) substrate. In the presence of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), p-AP could be cycled after its electro-oxidization on the electrode, enabling the increase of the anodic current. Because native AÎ² competed with the conjugates to bind the anchored antibody, the signal decreased with the increase of native AÎ² concentration. A detection limit of 5 pM was achieved. To demonstrate the viability of the method for analysis of AÎ²(1-42) and total AÎ² in real sample, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing AÎ²(1-40), AÎ²(1-42) and AÎ²(1-16) was tested. We believe that the simultaneous detection of AÎ²(1-42) and total AÎ² would be valuable for the early diagnosis of AD. 
24185262	Could intracrine biology play a role in the pathogenesis of transmissable spongiform encephalopathies, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases?
Am. J. Med. Sci.  2014Apr
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies have been shown to result from the misfolding of normal cellular prion proteins in neurons caused by a transmissible abnormal form of the protein. In recent years, similar transmission of abnormal proteins capable of inducing abnormal folding of their normal homologues has been reported in other neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and the so-called tauopathies. Thus, a new paradigm--the notion that some neurodegenerative disorders are protein "foldopathies"--has gained wide support. In addition, over recent years, the notion that some intercellular signaling proteins/peptides are intracrines--that is, they can in some instances act within their cells of synthesis or within target cells--has also gained currency. Tenets of this intracrine physiology/action have been developed. Here, it is argued that the protein functionalities demonstrated by foldopathy-related proteins are similar to intracrine actions and that these disorders could be intracrine in nature. If correct, this proposal would have therapeutic implications. 
24607962	Age-related brain expression and regulation of the chemokine CCL4/MIP-1Î² in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Apr
The detrimental effect of activation of the chemokine CCL4/MIP-1Î² on neuronal integrity in patients with HIV-associated dementia has directed attention to the potential role of CCL4 expression and regulation in Alzheimer disease. Here, we show that CCL4 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in the brains of APPswe/PS1Î”E9 (APP/PS1) double-transgenic mice, a model of cerebral amyloid deposition; expression was minimal in brains from nontransgenic littermates or single-mutant controls. Increased levels of CCL4 mRNA and protein directly correlated with the age-related progression of cerebral amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) levels in APP/PS1 mice. We also found significantly increased expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which was positively correlated with age-related AÎ² deposition and CCL4 in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed that ATF3 binds to the promoter region of the CCL4 gene, consistent with a potential role in regulating CCL4 transcription. Finally, elevated ATF3 mRNA expression in APP/PS1 brains was associated with hypomethylation of the ATF3 gene promoter region. These observations prompt the testable hypothesis for future study that CCL4 overexpression, regulated in part by hypomethylation of the ATF3 gene, may contribute to neuropathologic progression associated with amyloid deposition in Alzheimer disease.  
24607963	Neuron volumes in hippocampal subfields in delayed poststroke and aging-related dementias.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Apr
Hippocampal atrophy is widely recognized in Alzheimer disease (AD). Whether neurons within hippocampal subfields are similarly affected in other aging-related dementias, particularly after stroke, remains an open question. We investigated hippocampal CA3 and CA4 pyramidal neuron volumes and densities using 3-dimensional stereologic techniques in postmortem samples from a total of 67 subjects: poststoke demented (PSD; n = 11), nondemented stroke survivors (PSND) and PSD patients from the CogFAST (Cognitive Function After Stroke) cohort (n = 13), elderly controls (n = 12), and subjects diagnosed as having vascular dementia (n = 11), AD (n = 10), and mixed AD and vascular dementia (n = 10). We found that CA3 and CA4 neuron volumes were reduced in PSD samples compared with those in PSND samples. The CA3 and CA4 neuron volumes were positively correlated with poststroke global cognitive function but were not associated with the burden of AD pathology. There were no differences in total neuron densities in either subfield in any of the groups studied. Our results indicate that selective reductions in CA4 and to a lesser extent CA3 neuron volumes may be related to post stroke cognitive impairment and aging-related dementias. These data suggest that CA4 neurons are vulnerable to disease processes and support our previous finding that a reduction in hippocampal neuron volume predominantly reflects vascular mechanisms as contributing to dementia after stroke.  
24484275	Amygdalar atrophy in early Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Mar
Current research suggests that amygdalar volumes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be a relevant measure for its early diagnosis. However, findings are still inconclusive and controversial, partly because studies did not focus on the earliest stage of the disease. In this study, we measured amygdalar atrophy in 48 AD patients and 82 healthy controls (HC) by using a multi-atlas procedure, MAPER. Both hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, normalized by intracranial volume, were significantly reduced in AD compared with HC. The volume loss in the two structures was of similar magnitude (~24%). Amygdalar volume loss in AD predicted memory impairment after we controlled for age, gender, education, and, more important, hippocampal volume, indicating that memory decline correlates with amygdalar atrophy over and above hippocampal atrophy. Amygdalar volume may thus be as useful as hippocampal volume for the diagnosis of early AD. In addition, it could be an independent marker of cognitive decline. The role of the amygdala in AD should be reconsidered to guide further research and clinical practice. 
24484276	Impaired renal function and biomarkers of vascular disease in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Mar
Renal disease is a risk factor for vascular diseases and for dementia, and renal insufficiency can be a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence has suggested that vascular mechanisms mediate the link between renal disease and dementia. Our study sought to test this hypothesis by examining renal and vascular functioning in AD by investigating estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), calculated from serum creatinine concentrations, and established biomarkers of vascular functioning, asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) and plasma homocysteine (Hcy), in individuals with mild to moderate AD (n = 34) and a group of older adult controls (n = 34). We found significantly reduced eGFR, indicative of impaired renal functioning, in individuals with AD (M = 62.9, SD = 15.2) compared with controls (M = 73.6, SD = 11.8). However, concentrations of ADMA and Hcy did not differ between patient and control groups (ADMA: M = 0.47; M = 0.50; Hcy: M = 17.2; M = 14.9; patients and controls). The criteria for a mediation analysis were not met, as concentrations of ADMA and Hcy did not predict AD, indicating that these biomarkers of vascular functioning did not mediate a relationship between renal functioning and AD. This study indicated that renal insufficiency may independently contribute to AD pathology, and other vascular mechanisms may influence a relationship between renal impairment and AD. 
24484277	Advances of molecular imaging probes for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive decline in multiple cognitive domains and it becomes the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. There is an urgent need for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD to ease caregiver burden and medical costs, as well as improve patients' living activities associated with the dramatic increasing number of affected individuals. Molecular imaging with target-specific probes is contributing to identify the underlying biology in AD, which benefits to the early diagnosis of AD and the evaluation of anti-AD therapy. Molecular imaging probes, such as (11)C-PIB, (11)C-MP4A, (18)F-AV-45, and (11)F-FDG, can selectively bind to special bimolecular of AD or accurately accumulate at the location of damage areas, thus become an edge tool for a better management of the diseases in the clinical practice and new drug development. In the past decades, a large variety of probes is being developed and tested to be useful for the early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, patient selection for disease-modifying therapeutic trials and monitoring the effect of anti-amyloid therapy. Since imaging probes may also help to guide physicians to identify those patients that could best benefit from a given therapeutic regimen, dose, or duration of drug, this paper is to present a perspective of the available imaging probes for AD, classified on different modalities. Meanwhile, recent advances of those probes that have been selected for clinical trials and are at the different stages of the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) approval are outlined. Additionally, future directions and specific application of imaging strategies designed for both diagnosis and treatment for AD are discussed. 
24484280	Default mode, executive function, and language functional connectivity networks are compromised in mild Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by mental and cognitive problems, particularly with memory, language, visuospatial skills (VS), and executive functions (EF). Advances in the neuroimaging of AD have highlighted dysfunctions in functional connectivity networks (FCNs), especially in the memory related default mode network (DMN). However, little is known about the integrity and clinical significance of FNCs that process other cognitive functions than memory. We evaluated 22 patients with mild AD and 26 healthy controls through a resting state functional MRI scan. We aimed to identify different FCNs: the DMN, language, EF, and VS. Seed-based functional connectivity was calculated by placing a seed in the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex), language (Broca's and Wernicke's areas), EF (right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and VS networks (right and left associative visual cortex). We also performed regression analyses between individual connectivity maps for the different FCNs and the scores on cognitive tests. We found areas with significant decreases in functional connectivity in patients with mild AD in the DMN and Wernicke's area compared with controls. Increased connectivity in patients was observed in the EF network. Regarding multiple linear regression analyses, a significant correlation was only observed between the connectivity of the DMN and episodic memory (delayed recall) scores. In conclusion, functional connectivity alterations in mild AD are not restricted to the DMN. Other FCNs related to language and EF may be altered. However, we only found significant correlations between cognition and functional connectivity in the DMN and episodic memory performance. 
24694075	A new regulatory road-map for Alzheimer's disease drug development.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Mar
A surfeit of errors and an absence of sufficiently rigorous neuroscience theory have led to failures of neuroscience drug developments and to less effective patient care. Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires systematic grounding of drug developments with mechanistic explanations to replace current trial and error approaches to the development of potential drug products. We foresee the need for regulatory revisions that will provide better balanced supports for advancing the AD scientific knowledge required to more effectively develop clinically useful drugs and for provisions to patients of drug candidates soundly predicted, based on documented effects on AD neuropathologies and safety, to slow or arrest the progression of persons at-risk to AD dementia. We propose that investigators and regulators focus AD clinical research on understanding the inductions of reversible and irreversible neuropathologies and their roles in generating clinical dementia. In support of this, we foresee the need for regulatory changes to create a vehicle for these clinical studies; for example, conditional drug approvals based on drug induced neuropathological changes. 
24570279	Central cholinergic dysfunction in the adult form of Niemann Pick disease type C: a further link with Alzheimer's disease?
J. Neurol. 20140226 2014Apr
Adult patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) usually develop cognitive impairment progressing to dementia, whose pathophysiology remains still unclear. Noteworthy parallels exist in cognitive impairment and cellular pathology of NPC and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, alterations of cholinergic system, which represent one of the pathological hallmarks and contribute to cognitive deterioration in AD, have recently been demonstrated in a human brain autopsy and in an experimental model of NPC. This finding raised the issue that central cholinergic circuits dysfunction may contribute to pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in NPC as well, and prompted us to evaluate the cholinergic functional involvement in NPC patients by applying a neurophysiologic technique, named short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). We describe clinical, biochemical, molecular and neuropsychological features, and SAI findings in three patients affected by NPC. Diagnosis of NPC was assessed by molecular analysis of the NPC1 gene in all patients. In two of them, biochemical analysis of intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol was also performed. The main clinical features were cerebellar ataxia, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and a variable degree of cognitive impairment ranging from only memory impairment to severe dementia. Electrophysiological evaluation revealed a reduced SAI in all three patients. Our SAI findings provide evidence of cholinergic dysfunction in patients with the adult form of NPC, supporting that cholinergic alterations may play a role in cognitive impairment in NPC, and strengthening the similarities between NPC and AD. 
24597727	Free energy of lipid bilayer defects affected by Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-Î²42 monomers.
J Phys Chem B 20140320 2014Apr3
Experimental evidence suggests that the amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) associated with Alzheimer's disease strongly disturbs the integrity of lipid bilayers and cell membranes, as a possible origin of the toxicity of this peptide. Here, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to compute the free energy of membrane pores in the presence and absence of AÎ². The validation of our approach included the calculation of lipid flip-flop waiting times, which were found to agree well with recent experiments, in contrast with an earlier simulation study that apparently overestimated these waiting times. We find that, compared with peptide-free lipid bilayers, attached AÎ²42 peptides (i) increase the order parameters of the lipid tails but (ii) decrease the effective width of the hydrophobic region, (iii) reduce the free energy and thus enlarge the density of membrane pores, and (iv) increase the lifetime of pores. A detailed understanding of the interaction of AÎ²42 with lipid bilayer membranes may assist in the design of therapeutical strategies against Alzheimer's disease.  
23643457	Implications of early treatment among Medicaid patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130502 2014Mar
The objective of this study was to examine the effect of treatment timing on risk of institutionalization of Medicaid patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to estimate the economic implications of earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation. New Jersey Medicaid claims data (1997-2009) were used retrospectively to study the effect of treatment on time to institutionalization. Observed Medicaid payments were used to calculate savings from delayed institutionalization, adjusting for cost offsets resulting from concurrent changes in use of other medical services. Initiation of existing therapies at earliest symptomatic onset is predicted to delay institutionalization by 91 days, reducing Medicaid costs by $19,108/institutionalized patient. Incorporating an 18.5% cost offset from increased use of other medical services as well as drug costs associated with earlier treatment results in net savings of $12,687/patient. Projected annual Medicaid savings exceed $1 billion. Earlier treatment leads to a small delay in institutionalization among AD patients, resulting in significant costs savings to Medicaid. 
23706517	Personality and risk of Alzheimer's disease: new data and meta-analysis.
Alzheimers Dement 20130521 2014Mar
We examine whether broad factors and specific facets of personality are associated with increased risk of incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a long-run longitudinal study and a meta-analysis of published studies. Participants (n = 1671) were monitored for up to 22 years from a baseline personality assessment. The meta-analysis pooled results from up to five prospective studies (n = 5054). Individuals with scores in the top quartile of neuroticism (hazard ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.6-6.0) or the lowest quartile of conscientiousness (hazard ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-7.4) had a threefold increased risk of incident AD. Among the components of these traits, self-discipline and depression had the strongest associations with incident AD. The meta-analysis confirmed the associations of neuroticism (P = 2 Ã— 10(-9)) and conscientiousness (P = 2 Ã— 10(-6)), along with weaker effects for openness and agreeableness (P &lt; .05). The current study and meta-analysis indicate that personality traits are associated with increased risk of AD, with effect sizes similar to those of well-established clinical and lifestyle risk factors. 
23727080	Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review of economic evaluations.
Alzheimers Dement 20130530 2014Mar
The objective of this study is to systematically review the literature on economic evaluations of interventions for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders and to describe their general and methodological characteristics. We focused on the diagnostic aspects of the decision models to assess the applicability of existing decision models for the evaluation of the recently revised diagnostic research criteria for AD. PubMed and the National Institute for Health Research Economic Evaluation database were searched for English-language publications related to economic evaluations on diagnostic technologies. Trial-based economic evaluations were assessed using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria list. Modeling studies were assessed using the framework for quality assessment of decision-analytic models. The search retrieved 2109 items, from which eight decision-analytic modeling studies and one trial-based economic evaluation met all eligibility criteria. Diversity among the study objective and characteristics was considerable and, despite considerable methodological quality, several flaws were indicated. Recommendations were focused on diagnostic aspects and the applicability of existing models for the evaluation of recently revised diagnostic research criteria for AD. 
23830913	ADO: a disease ontology representing the domain knowledge specific to Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20130703 2014Mar
Biomedical ontologies offer the capability to structure and represent domain-specific knowledge semantically. Disease-specific ontologies can facilitate knowledge exchange across multiple disciplines, and ontology-driven mining approaches can generate great value for modeling disease mechanisms. However, in the case of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, there is a lack of formal representation of the relevant knowledge domain. Alzheimer's disease ontology (ADO) is constructed in accordance to the ontology building life cycle. The ProtÃ©gÃ© OWL editor was used as a tool for building ADO in Ontology Web Language format. ADO was developed with the purpose of containing information relevant to four main biological views-preclinical, clinical, etiological, and molecular/cellular mechanisms-and was enriched by adding synonyms and references. Validation of the lexicalized ontology by means of named entity recognition-based methods showed a satisfactory performance (F score = 72%). In addition to structural and functional evaluation, a clinical expert in the field performed a manual evaluation and curation of ADO. Through integration of ADO into an information retrieval environment, we show that the ontology supports semantic search in scientific text. The usefulness of ADO is authenticated by dedicated use case scenarios. Development of ADO as an open ADO is a first attempt to organize information related to Alzheimer's disease in a formalized, structured manner. We demonstrate that ADO is able to capture both established and scattered knowledge existing in scientific text. 
23850331	Accounting for functional loss in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies: beyond cognition.
Alzheimers Dement 20130711 2014Mar
The relative contributions of cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits to the impairment of physical or instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs) may differ in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify the amount of variability in physical self-maintenance and instrumental ADL ratings predicted by cognitive, motor, and behavioral indices separately for patients with autopsy-diagnosed DLB (n = 39) or AD (n = 39). Motor dysfunction accounted for significant variance in physical ADLs in DLB (R(2) change = 0.17), whereas behavioral (R(2) change = 0.23) and motor dysfunction (R(2) change = 0.13) accounted for significant variance in AD. Motor (R(2) change = 0.32) and cognitive (R(2) change = 0.10) dysfunction accounted for significant variance in instrumental ADLs in DLB, whereas cognitive (R(2) change = 0.36) and behavioral (R(2) change = 0.12) dysfunction accounted for significant variance in AD. Cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits contribute differently to ADL changes in DLB and AD. Thus, treatments designed to ameliorate a certain aspect of AD or DLB (e.g., cognitive dysfunction) may have a larger impact on everyday functioning in one disorder than the other. 
23850332	Clinical characterization of a presenilin 1 mutation (F177S) in a family with very early-onset Alzheimer's disease in the third decade of life.
Alzheimers Dement 20130711 2014Mar
Early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (AD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 gene. The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotype in a large family with a PSEN1 F177S mutation by performing detailed clinical assessments, neuroimaging, and neuropathological analysis. In two subjects, clinical and neuropsychological assessments, structural magnetic resonance imaging, F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomographic imaging, AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and genetic analysis were available. In three deceased affected subjects, medical records were reviewed. In one subject, a complete neuropathological examination was available. Cognitive impairment and neurological symptoms developed homogeneously around 30 years of age and worsened rapidly. All subjects died about 7 years (range, 6-8 years) after disease onset before 40 years of age. All technical diagnostic information (neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid) were typically for AD. Neuropathology showed abundant neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, typical of severe AD. Antidementia treatment in one subject did not alter the length of survival. The PSEN1 F177S mutation leads to typical AD starting at age 30 and a homogeneous phenotype with rapid cognitive decline and prominent neurological symptoms. Excessive amyloid beta 42 production in the brain cortex corresponds well with other PSEN1 mutations. 
23954029	Simulating effects of biomarker enrichment on Alzheimer's disease prevention trials: conceptual framework and example.
Alzheimers Dement 20130815 2014Mar
We present a conceptual framework for simulations to determine the utility of biomarker enrichment to increase statistical power to detect a treatment effect in future Alzheimer's disease prevention trials. We include a limited set of simulation results to illustrate aspects of this framework. We simulated data based on the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial, and a range of sample sizes, biomarker positive predictive values, and treatment effects. We also investigated the consequences of assuming homogeneity of parameter estimates as a function of dementia outcome. Use of biomarkers to increase the sample fraction that would develop Alzheimer's disease in the absence of intervention from 0.5 to 0.8 would increase power from 0.35 to 0.69 with n = 200. Ignoring sample heterogeneity resulted in overestimation of power. Biomarker enrichment can increase statistical power, but estimates of the expected increase are sensitive to a variety of assumptions outlined in the framework. 
24418054	Time course of brain volume changes in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20140110 2014Mar
Structural alterations of a large network characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the time course of these changes remains unclear. The dynamic of these alterations was examined in the AD preclinical phase using data from the 10-year follow-up of a population-based cohort (Bordeaux-3City). Participants received neuropsychological assessments every 2 years and two identical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams at baseline and 4 years later. Twenty-five incident AD cases were compared with 319 subjects who remained free of dementia. Subjects were free of dementia at baseline and at follow-up MRI. Incident AD occurred after these time points. At baseline, incident AD already presented smaller volumes only in the left amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Moreover, a higher annual rate of atrophy of the temporoparietal cortices was observed in future AD subjects during the following 4 years. Incident AD cases present mediotemporal lesions up to 5 years before diagnosis. This neurodegenerative process seems to progressively reach the temporoparietal cortices in the AD preclinical phase. 
24439169	Microvascular network alterations in the retina of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement 20140115 2014Mar
Although cerebral small-vessel disease has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the cerebral microcirculation is difficult to visualize directly in vivo. Because the retina provides a noninvasive window to assess the microcirculation, we determined whether quantitatively measured retinal microvascular parameters are associated with AD. We conducted a case-control study (case:control matching â‰ˆ 1:2). Retinal photographs were analyzed using a computer program, and a spectrum of quantitative retinal microvascular parameters (caliber, fractal dimension, tortuosity, and bifurcation) were measured. Logistic regression models were used to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval for AD adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and history of myocardial infarction. We included 136 demented patients with AD and 290 age-gender-race-matched controls. Persons with narrower venular caliber (OR per standard deviation [SD] decrease, 2.01 [1.27-3.19]), decreased arteriolar and venular fractal dimension (OR per SD decrease 1.35 [1.08-1.68], 1.47 [1.17-1.84], respectively) and increased arteriolar and venular tortuosity (OR per SD increase, 1.84 [1.40-2.31], 1.94 [1.48-2.53], respectively) were more likely to have AD. These associations still persisted when only AD cases without a history of cerebrovascular disease were included. Patients with AD have altered microvascular network in the retina (narrower retinal venules and a sparser and more tortuous retinal vessels) compared with matched nondemented controls. These changes in retinal microvasculature may reflect similar pathophysiological processes in cerebral microvasculature in the brains of patients with AD. 
24698029	Rethinking the Food and Drug Administration's 2013 guidance on developing drugs for early-stage Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Mar
The February 2013 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for developing drugs for early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) creates certain challenges as they guide toward the use of one cognitive outcome to gain accelerated marketing approval for preclinical AD drugs, and a composite clinical scale - the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale in particular - for the primary outcome for prodromal AD clinical trials. In light of the developing knowledge regarding early stage diagnoses and clinical trials outcomes, we recommend that FDA describe its requirements for validating preclinical AD diagnoses for drug development purposes, maintain the principle for requiring coprimary outcomes, and encourage the advancement of outcomes for early stage AD trials. The principles for drug development for early stage AD should not differ from those for clinical AD, especially as the diagnoses of prodromal and early AD impinge on each other. The FDA should not recommend that a composite scale be used as a sole primary efficacy outcome to support a marketing claim unless it requires that the cognitive and functional components of such a scale are demonstrated to be individually meaningful. The current draft guidelines may inadvertently constrain efforts to better assess the clinical effects of new drugs and inhibit innovation in an area where evidence-based clinical research practices are still evolving.  
24698031	Deaths in the United States among persons with Alzheimer's disease (2010-2050).
Alzheimers Dement  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) profoundly affects the end-of-life experience. Yet, counts of deaths attributable to AD understate this burden of AD in the population. Therefore, we estimated the annual number of deaths in the United States among older adults with AD from 2010 to 2050. We calculated probabilities of AD incidence and mortality from a longitudinal population-based study of 10,802 participants. From this population, 1913 previously disease-free individuals, selected via stratified random sampling, underwent 2577 detailed clinical evaluations. Over the course of follow-up, 990 participants died. We computed age-, sex-, race-, and education-specific AD incidences and education-adjusted AD mortality proportions specific to age, sex, and race group. We then combined these probabilities with US-wide census, education, and mortality data. In 2010, approximately 600,000 deaths occurred among individuals aged 65 years or older with AD, comprising 32% of all older adult deaths. By 2050, this number is projected to be 1.6 million, 43% of all older adult deaths. Individuals with AD comprise a substantial number of older adult deaths in the United States, a number expected to rise considerably in coming decades. 
23647635	Effect of a multimodal exercise program on sleep disturbances and instrumental activities of daily living performance on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease patients.
Geriatr Gerontol Int 20130506 2014Apr
To assess the contribution of a multimodal exercise program on the sleep disturbances (SD) and on the performance of instrumental activities daily living (IADL) in patients with clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease patients (PD). A total of 42 consecutive patients (23 training group, 19 control group) with PD and 35 demented patients with AD (19 trained group, 16 control group) were recruited. Participants in both training groups carried out three 1-h sessions per week of a multimodal exercise program for 6 months. The Pfeffer Questionnaire for Instrumental Activities and the Mini-Sleep Questionnaire were used to assess the effects of the program on IADL and SD respectively. Two-way ancova showed interactions in IADL and SD. Significant improvements were observed for these variables in both intervention groups, and maintenance or worsening was observed in control groups. The analysis of effect size showed these improvements. The present study results show that a mild to moderate intensity of multimodal physical exercises carried out on a regular basis over 6 months can contribute to reducing IADL deficits and attenuating SD. 
24518149	Automated algorithm to measure changes in medial temporal lobe volume in Alzheimer disease.
J. Neurosci. Methods 20140208 2014Apr30
The change in volume of anatomic structures is as a sensitive indicator of Alzheimer disease (AD) progression. Although several methods are available to measure brain volumes, improvements in speed and automation are required. Our objective was to develop a fully automated, fast, and reliable approach to measure change in medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume, including primarily hippocampus. The MTL volume defined in an atlas image was propagated onto each baseline image and a level set algorithm was applied to refine the shape and smooth the boundary. The MTL of the baseline image was then mapped onto the corresponding follow-up image to measure volume change (Î”MTL). Baseline and 24 months 3D T1-weighted images from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were randomly selected for 50 normal elderly controls (NECs), 50 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 50 subjects with AD to test the algorithm. The method was compared to the FreeSurfer segmentation tools. The average Î”MTL (meanÂ±SEM) was 68Â±35mm(3) in NEC, 187Â±38mm(3) in MCI and 300Â±34mm(3) in the AD group and was significantly different (p&lt;0.0001) between all three groups. The Î”MTL was correlated with cognitive decline. Results for the FreeSurfer software were similar but did not detect significant differences between the MCI and AD groups. This novel segmentation approach is fully automated and provides a robust marker of brain atrophy that shows different rates of atrophy over 2 years between NEC, MCI, and AD groups. 
24606058	Quantification of the brain proteome in Alzheimer's disease using multiplexed mass spectrometry.
J. Proteome Res. 20140319 2014Apr4
We have compared the brain proteome in the temporal neocortex between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and non-AD individuals by using shotgun mass spectrometry based on a stable isotope dimethyl labeling. A total of 827 unique proteins were identified and quantitated. Of these, 227 proteins were found in at least 9 out of 10 AD/control pairs and were further subjected to statistical analysis. A total of 69 proteins showed different levels (p-value &lt; 0.05) in AD versus control brain samples. Of these proteins, 37 were increased and 32 were decreased as compared to the non-AD subjects. Twenty-three proteins comprise novel proteins that have not previously been reported as related to AD, e.g., neuronal-specific septin-3, septin-2, septin-5, dihydropteridine reductase, and clathrin heavy chain 1. The proteins with altered levels in the AD brain represent a wide variety of pathways suggested to be involved in the disease pathogenesis, including energy metabolism, glycolysis, oxidative stress, apoptosis, signal transduction, and synaptic functioning. Apart from leading to new insights into the molecular mechanisms in AD, the findings provide us with possible novel candidates for future diagnostic and prognostic disease markers.  
24576746	Increased plasma levels of BDNF and inflammatory markers in Alzheimer's disease.
J Psychiatr Res 20140213 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Neurotrophic factors and inflammatory markers may play considerable roles in AD. In this study we measured, through Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, the plasma levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF), as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha soluble receptors, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), in 50 AD patients, 37 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 56 healthy elderly controls. BDNF levels, expressed as median and interquartile range, were higher for AD patients (2545.3, 1497.4-4153.4Â pg/ml) compared to controls (1503.8, 802.3-2378.4Â pg/ml), PÂ &lt;Â 0.001. sICAM-1 was also higher in AD patients. sTNFR1 levels were increased in AD when compared to controls and also to MCI. GDNF, NGF and sTNFR2 levels showed no significant differences among the studied groups. The increase in BDNF might reflect a compensatory mechanism against early neurodegeneration and seems to be related to inflammation. sTNFR1 appears to mark not only the inflammatory state but also differentiates between MCI and AD, which may be an additional tool for differentiating degrees of cognitive impairment.  
23871727	Apolipoprotein E genotypes associated with Alzheimer disease and concomitant stroke.
J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis 20130718 2014Apr
The É›4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a well-characterized genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). The association between stroke and a higher risk for AD has also been reported. Our study sought to determine the relationship between the APOE gene and AD and the comorbid risk of stroke. The subjects of this study consisted of 48 patients with AD and 48 members of a control group. All subjects were genotyped for APOE. The results clearly show a significant increased risk of AD in carriers of the APOE Îµ3/Îµ4 genotype (P = .003, odds ratio [OR] = 4.1) or Îµ4 allele (P = .001, OR = 4.2). The risk for stroke in AD patients was also increased for carriers of the APOE Îµ3/Îµ4 genotype (P = .02, OR = 9.0) and for carriers of the APOE Îµ4 allele (P = .004, OR = 5.5). The present study is the first to establish a relationship between APOE Îµ4 and concomitant AD and stroke in the Tunisian population. 
24602800	Temsirolimus promotes autophagic clearance of amyloid-Î² and provides protective effects in cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease.
Pharmacol. Res. 20140303 2014Mar
Accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptides (AÎ²) within brain is a major pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy, an important intracellular catabolic process, is involved in AÎ² clearance. Here, we investigated whether temsirolimus, a newly developed compound approved by Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for renal cell carcinoma treatment, would promote autophagic clearance of AÎ² and thus provide protective effects in cellular and animal models of AD. HEK293 cells expressing the Swedish mutant of APP695 (HEK293-APP695) were treated with vehicle or 100nM temsirolimus for 24h in the presence or absence of 3-methyladenine (5mM) or Atg5-siRNA, and intracellular AÎ² levels as well as autophagy biomarkers were measured. Meanwhile, APP/PS1 mice received intraperitoneal injection of temsirolimus (20mg/kg) every 2 days for 60 days, and brain AÎ² burden, autophagy biomarkers, cellular apoptosis in hippocampus, and spatial cognitive functions were assessed. Our results showed that temsirolimus enhanced AÎ² clearance in HEK293-APP695 cells and in brain of APP/PS1 mice in an autophagy-dependent manner. Meanwhile, temsirolimus attenuated cellular apoptosis in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which was accompanied by an improvement in spatial learning and memory abilities. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that temsirolimus promotes autophagic AÎ² clearance and exerts protective effects in cellular and animal models of AD, suggesting that temsirolimus administration may represent a new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Meanwhile, these findings emphasize the notion that many therapeutic agents possess pleiotropic actions aside from their main applications.  
24719875	Simple method for evaluation of planum temporale pyramidal neurons shrinkage in postmortem tissue of Alzheimer disease patients.
Biomed Res Int 20140211 2014
We measured the length of the pyramidal neurons in the cortical layer III in four subregions of the planum temporale (transitions into superior temporal gyrus, Heschl's gyrus, insular cortex, and Sylvian fissure) in control group and Alzheimer disease patients. Our hypothesis was that overall length of the pyramidal neurons would be smaller in the Alzheimer disease group compared to controls and also there would be right-left asymmetry in both the control and Alzheimer disease groups. We found pyramidal neuron length asymmetry only in controls--in the transition into the Sylvian fissure--and the rest of the subregions in the control group and Alzheimer disease patients did not show size difference. However, control-Alzheimer disease group pyramidal neuron length comparison revealed (a) no length difference in superior temporal gyrus transition area, (b) reversal of asymmetry in the insular transition area with left insular transition significantly shorter in the Alzheimer disease group compared to the control group, (c) both right and left Heschl's gyrus transitions significantly shorter in the Alzheimer disease group compared to the control group, and (d) right Sylvian fissure transition significantly shorter in the Alzheimer disease group compared to the control group. This neuronal length measurement method could supplement already existing neuropathological criteria for postmortem Alzheimer disease diagnostics. 
24719894	Improved candidate drug mining for Alzheimer's disease.
Biomed Res Int 20140227 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia for older people. Although several antidementia drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine have been developed, the effectiveness of AD drug therapy is still far from satisfactory. Recently, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been chosen as one of the personalized medicine markers. Many pharmacogenomics databases have been developed to provide comprehensive information by associating SNPs with drug responses, disease incidence, and genes that are critical in choosing personalized therapy. However, we found that some information from different sets of pharmacogenomics databases is not sufficient and this may limit the potential functions for pharmacogenomics. To address this problem, we used approximate string matching method and data mining approach to improve the searching of pharmacogenomics database. After computation, we can successfully identify more genes linked to AD and AD-related drugs than previous online searching. These improvements may help to improve the pharmacogenomics of AD for personalized medicine.  
24803694	Inhibitory effect of some tropical green leafy vegetables on key enzymes linked to Alzheimer's disease and some pro-oxidant induced lipid peroxidation in rats' brain.
J Food Sci Technol 20111104 2014May
This study sought to investigate the inhibitory effect of some commonly consumed Nigerian green leafy vegetables (raw and blanched) on acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (key enzyme linked to Alzheimer's disease) activities and some pro-oxidants (FeSO4, Sodium nitroprusside and Quinolinic acid) induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain in vitro. Three commonly consumed green leafy vegetables in Nigeria [Amarantus cruentus (Arowojeja), Struchium sparganophora (Ewuro-odo) and Telfairia occidentalis (Ugwu] were blanched in hot water for 10Â min, and the extracts of the raw and blanched vegetables were prepared and used for subsequent analysis. The result revealed that all the vegetables inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity as well as the pro-oxidants induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain in a dose dependent manner; however, Amarantus cruentus extract (EC50â€‰=â€‰97.9Â Î¼g/ml) had the highest inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase activity while Telfairia occidentalis extract (EC50â€‰=â€‰52.7Â Î¼g/ml) had the highest inhibitory effect on butyrylcholinesterase activity. However, blanching of the vegetables caused a significant (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) decrease in the inhibitory effect of the vegetables on AChE activities while it enhanced the inhibition of the pro-oxidants induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain in vitro. Therefore, some of the possible mechanism by which green leafy vegetables exert their neuroprotective activities could be through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities and prevention of lipid peroxidation in the brain. However, blanching of the vegetables could reduce their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity.  
24812907	[Effect of Xiaoyao Powder on the ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters of Alzheimer's disease model mice].
Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi  2014Apr
To investigate the effect of Xiaoyao Powder (XP) and its compatible prescriptions on the ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters, thus exploring their effects and mechanism in preventing and treating D-galactose induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice, and clarifying the compatibility mechanism for soothing Gan, nourishing blood, and invigorating Pi. Sixty SPF mice were randomly divided into the blank control group, the model group, and the XP group, Shugan Jianpi group (SJ), Shugan Yangxue group (SY), and Jianpi Yangxue group (JY), 10 in each group.The AD mouse model was prepared by peritoneal injecting D-galactose. Meanwhile, mice in the blank control group and the model group were administered with physiological saline (at the daily dose of 24 mL/kg) by gastrogavage. Mice in the XP group (2.485 g/kg), the SY group (1.136 g/kg), the SJ group (1.775 g/kg), and the JY group (2.059 g/kg) were administered with corresponding medicated decoction by gastrogavage, with the gastric volume of 24 mL/kg. On the 41st day the training of capability for learning and memory was started. On the 42nd day capability for learning and memory was tested. The brain tissue was cut. One half was used to determine the contents of homogenate acetyl cholinesterase (AchE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and monoamine oxidase (MAO).Another half was used to carry out morphological observations. The capability for learning and memory could be improved and the latency time could be lowered in all the treatment groups. Besides, the homogenate AchE and MAO could also be elevated, ChAT could be lowered; the morphology, number, and distribution of neurons could be improved. But the improvement of ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters were most obviously seen in the XP group. XP could improve the ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters, and showed better effects on prevention and treatment of AD. The rationality of compatibility methods and combination thinking ways of soothing Gan, nourishing blood, and invigorating Pi were clarified. 
24374923	Immunochemical detection of lipid hydroperoxide- and aldehyde-modified proteins in diseases.
Subcell. Biochem.  2014
Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) is easily peroxidized by free radicals and enzymes. When this occurs, it results in the compromised integrity of cellular membranes and leads to lipid hydroperoxide as a major reaction product, which is decomposed into aldehyde. Lipid hydroperoxide-modified lysine is known to be an early product of the lipid peroxidation process, suggesting that it might be a PUFA-oxidative stress marker during the initial stage of oxidative stress. Lipid hydroperoxides cause or enhance ROS-mediated DNA fragmentation. The Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehydes are end products of PUFA peroxidation. They are highly reactive and readily attack and modify the protein amino acid residues into aldehyde-modified proteins. Lipid peroxidation-derived Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehydes are capable of inducing cellular stress-responsive processes such as cell signaling and apoptosis. The lipid hydroperoxide- and aldehyde-modified proteins have been immunohistochemically detected in diverse pathological situations such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and chemical material-induced liver injury and renal tubular injury in humans and experimental animals. These findings suggest that the expression of the lipid hydroperoxide- and aldehyde-modified proteins is closely associated with the pathogenesis of these diseases in humans and experimental animals.  
24284365	Age-related alterations in the metabolic profile in the hippocampus of the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8: a spontaneous Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder, produces a progressive decline in cognitive function. The metabolic mechanism of AD has emerged in recent years. In this study, we used multivariate analyses of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements to determine that learning and retention-related metabolic profiles are altered during aging in the hippocampus of the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8). Alterations in 17 metabolites were detected in mature and aged mice compared to young mice (13 decreased and 4 increased metabolites), including metabolites related to dysfunctional lipid metabolism (significantly increased cholesterol, oleic acid, and phosphoglyceride levels), decreased amino acid (alanine, serine, glycine, aspartic acid, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid), and energy-related metabolite levels (malic acid, butanedioic acid, fumaric acid, and citric acid), and other altered metabolites (increased N-acetyl-aspartic acid and decreased pyroglutamic acid, urea, and lactic acid) in the hippocampus. All of these alterations indicated that the metabolic mechanisms of age-related cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice were related to multiple pathways and networks. Lipid metabolism, especially cholesterol metabolism, appears to play a distinct role in the hippocampus in AD. 
24413614	Retina: source of the earliest biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease?
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops undiagnosed for 10-15 years due to the lack of early diagnostic biomarkers. Visual deficits are common and crippling in AD patients and histopathological alterations found in the retina and brain are similar. We hypothesize that subtle morphological and functional changes in microglial and neuronal activities, such as those recently reported in the hippocampus, may also occur in retina during the preclinical stages of AD. These alterations are likely much more accessible to modern imaging and electrophysiological exploration than those occurring in the hippocampus and therefore, may serve as the earliest diagnostic biomarkers for AD.  
24413618	Why vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease? The hypothesis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Scientists have worked for over a century to uncover the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with the ultimate goal of discovering a treatment. However, none of the approaches utilized have defined the exact cause of the disease or an ultimate treatment for AD. In this review, we aim to define the role of vitamin D in AD from a novel and fundamental perspective and attempt to answer the following question: Why should we seriously consider "simple" vitamin D as a "fundamental factor" in AD? To answer this question, we explain the protective effects of vitamin D in the central nervous system and how the action of vitamin D and AD-type pathology overlap. Furthermore, we suggest that the role of vitamin D in AD includes not only vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D-related genes but also the disruption of vitamin D metabolism and action. This suggestion is supported by evidence that the disruption of vitamin D pathways mimic amyloid pathology. We define the term "inefficient utilization of vitamin D" as any alteration in vitamin D-related genes, including receptors, the enzymes related to vitamin D metabolism or the transporters of vitamin D, and we discuss the potential correlation of vitamin D status with the vulnerability of neurons to aging and neurodegeneration. Finally, in addition to the current knowledge that defines AD, we suggest that AD could be the result of a long-term hormonal imbalance in which the critical hormone is vitamin D, a secosteroid that has long been misnamed.  
24413619	A novel PSEN1 mutation (I238M) associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in an African-American woman.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Mutations in PSEN1 are the most common cause of autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). We describe an African-American woman with a family history consistent with FAD who began to experience cognitive decline at age 50. Her clinical presentation, MRI, FDG-PET, and PIB-PET scan findings were consistent with AD and she was found to have a novel I238M substitution in PSEN1. As this mutation caused increased production of AÎ²42 in an in vitro assay, was not present in two population databases, and is conserved across species, it is likely to be pathogenic for FAD.  
24413620	Shape changes of the basal ganglia and thalamus in Alzheimer's disease: a three-year longitudinal study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
A large number of Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies have focused on medial temporal and cortical atrophy, while changes in the basal ganglia or thalamus have received less attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the existence of progressive topographical shape changes in the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus) and thalamus concurrent with AD disease progression over three years. This study also examined whether declines in volumes of the basal ganglia or thalamus might be responsible for cognitive decline in patients with AD. Thirty-six patients with early stage AD and 14 normal control subjects were prospectively recruited for this study. All subjects were assessed with neuropsychological tests and MRI at baseline and Years 1 and 3. A longitudinal shape analysis of the basal ganglia and thalamus was performed by employing a boundary surface-based shape analysis method. AD patients exhibited specific regional atrophy in the right caudate nucleus and the bilateral putamen at baseline, and as the disease progressed, regional atrophic changes in the left caudate nucleus were found to conform to a distinct topography after controlling the total brain volume. Volumetric decline of the caudate nucleus and putamen correlated with cognitive decline in frontal function after controlling for age, gender, education, follow-up years, and total brain volume changes. Our findings suggest that shape changes of the basal ganglia occurred regardless of whole brain atrophy as AD progressed and were also responsible for cognitive decline that was observed from the frontal function tests. 
24413621	Greater attenuation of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in Alzheimer's disease patients.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) may reflect neurodegeneration of the central nervous system, which has been reported as part of the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, AD patients have thinner RNFL as compared to age-matched normal controls. However, whether reduction of RNFL over time can predict those at higher risk to develop cognitive deterioration remains unknown. We therefore set out a prospective clinical investigation to determine both the reduction of RNFL thickness and the deterioration of cognitive function over a period of 25 months in 78 participants (mean age 72.31 Â± 3.98 years, 52% men). The participants were categorized as stable participants whose cognitive status remained unchanged (n = 60) and converted participants whose cognitive status deteriorated, which was diagnosed by DSM-VI (for AD) and Petersen's definition (for mild cognitive impairment) (n = 18). Here we show for the first time that the converted participants had greater reduction of RNFL thickness than the stable participants. Specifically, the reduction in the thickness of the inferior quadrant RNFL in the converted participants was greater than that in stable participants [-11.0 Â± 12.8 (mean Â± standard deviation) Î¼m versus 0.4 Â± 15.7 Î¼m, p = 0.009]. These data showed that greater reduction in the inferior quadrant of RNFL thickness might indicate a higher risk for the old adults to develop cognitive deterioration. These findings have established a system to embark on a larger scale study to further test whether changes in RNFL thickness can serve as a biomarker of AD.  
24448779	Mitochondrial DNA copy numbers in pyramidal neurons are decreased and mitochondrial biogenesis transcriptome signaling is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease hippocampi.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of adult-onset dementia and is characterized in its pre-diagnostic stage by reduced cerebral cortical glucose metabolism and in later stages by reduced cortical oxygen uptake, implying reduced mitochondrial respiration. Using quantitative PCR we determined the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene copy numbers from multiple groups of 15 or 20 pyramidal neurons, GFAP(+) astrocytes and dentate granule neurons isolated using laser capture microdissection, and the relative expression of mitochondrial biogenesis (mitobiogenesis) genes in hippocampi from 10 AD and 9 control (CTL) cases. AD pyramidal but not dentate granule neurons had significantly reduced mtDNA copy numbers compared to CTL neurons. Pyramidal neuron mtDNA copy numbers in CTL, but not AD, positively correlated with cDNA levels of multiple mitobiogenesis genes. In CTL, but not in AD, hippocampal cDNA levels of PGC1Î± were positively correlated with multiple downstream mitobiogenesis factors. Mitochondrial DNA copy numbers in pyramidal neurons did not correlate with hippocampal AÎ²1-42 levels. After 48 h exposure of H9 human neural stem cells to the neurotoxic fragment AÎ²25-35, mtDNA copy numbers were not significantly altered. In summary, AD postmortem hippocampal pyramidal neurons have reduced mtDNA copy numbers. Mitochondrial biogenesis pathway signaling relationships are disrupted in AD, but are mostly preserved in CTL. Our findings implicate complex alterations of mitochondria-host cell relationships in AD.  
24448781	Concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
A growing body of evidence shows the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in neurodegeneration processes, but reports of their concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the CSF concentrations of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and their inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) in carefully selected groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and non-demented controls, whose clinical and neuropsychological diagnoses were confirmed by the corresponding CSF biomarkers of neurochemical dementia diagnostics: decreased concentrations of AÎ²1-42 and/or AÎ²42/40 ratio, and increased concentrations of Tau and pTau181 proteins. The study included 33 AD patients, 15 subjects with MCI, and 18 elderly individuals without cognitive deficits. The CSF concentrations of MMPs and TIMPs were determined with ELISAs. CSF concentrations of MMP-9 were significantly lower, and the concentrations of MMP-3 significantly higher in AD patients compared to the controls. Neither MMP-2 nor TIMPs showed significant changes among the groups investigated. Altered concentrations of two out of three MMPs investigated in this study suggest that this family of biomolecules may play a role in the AD pathophysiology. Further studies are needed to establish their potential diagnostic utility. 
24448783	Visuo-perceptive priming in Alzheimer's disease: evidence for a multi-componential implicit memory system.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
In the past two decades research has highlighted how implicit memory processes are spared in degenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are characterized by the early onset of explicit memory deficits. However, according to recent studies, there may be dissociations among different types of implicit memory. Although several studies have shown selective sparing of lexical priming in AD, it is not completely clear what happens to other types of implicit memory processes, such as visuo-perceptual priming. The present study examines the possibility that the visuo-perceptual priming effect is spared in AD. We tested two groups of participants, i.e., a group of AD patients and a group of healthy age-matched controls, using a visuo-perceptual priming task. The task required the identification of fragmented pictures. Results showed a deficient priming effect in AD patients when it was measured by an Identification of Fragmented Pictures task. We discuss our results in light of the current hypothesis of a functional segregation in priming processes.  
24448789	Accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid AÎ²(1-42) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 65-70% of all dementia cases. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid AÎ²1-42 for the diagnosis of AD. A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, LILACS, Grey literature, and EMBASE was performed for papers published from January 1990 to August 2013. The following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were searched: "Alzheimer disease" or "AD" and "amyloid-Î²" or "AÎ²1-42". We included case-control and cross-sectional studies, prospective or retrospective, that evaluated AÎ²1-42 levels in AD. Statistical analysis was performed using REVMAN 5.2, Meta Disc, and Stata 11.0. A total of 804 citations were identified by the search strategy and 41 studies were included. Meta-analysis showed a sensitivity of 84.3% (95% CI: 85.6%-81%) and specificity of 79.4% (95% CI: 77.6%-81.1%). The diagnostic odds ratio was 28.9 (95% CI: 21.2-39.5). Our study demonstrated that AÎ²1-42 can discriminate AD from controls with good sensitivity and specificity. 
24473186	Abnormal amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations of intrinsic brain activity in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of intrinsic brain activity in 23 patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 27 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Two different frequency bands were analyzed (slow-5:0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4:0.027-0.073 Hz). In many brain regions, widespread ALFF differences between the two frequency bands were observed, including predominantly the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (Hip/PHG), insula, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Compared to controls, AD patients showed decreased ALFF values in the bilateral PCC/PCu, inferior parietal lobe, and several temporal regions, and increased ALFF values mainly in the bilateral Hip/PHG, and middle and inferior temporal gyri. Intriguingly, the ALFF abnormalities in the left PCu, left supramarginal gyrus, and several temporal regions were greater in the slow-5 band compared to the slow-4 band. Moreover, correcting for gray matter volume loss significantly affected the functional analytical results, suggesting that gray matter loss can partially account for the functional imaging analytical results obtained in AD. Finally, we showed that regions with changes in ALFF demonstrated a significant correlation with patient cognitive performance as measured using Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The results also demonstrated a significant correlation between hippocampal volume and the ALFF in slow-5 band in the AD group. This study demonstrated widespread ALFF abnormalities of intrinsic brain activity in AD and revealed that the ALFF abnormalities in severe specific regions were frequency-dependent. Taken together, our findings provided novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of AD and may be helpful in the development of imaging biomarkers for disease diagnosis.  
24659320	Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease.
Cochrane Database Syst Rev 20140321 2014
Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population. To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with Alzheimer's disease through identification and analysis of all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 31 March 2013 using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, "rest-activity", sundowning. We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with Alzheimer's disease who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them. Two authors working independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias and results from the included study reports. Additional information was obtained from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model. We found RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (209 participants, three studies, but only two yielded data suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study) and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, very limited information available).The melatonin and trazodone studies were of people with moderate-to-severe AD; the ramelteon study was of people with mild-to-moderate AD. In all studies participants had a variety of common sleep problems. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the published studies were at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting and some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.We found no evidence that melatonin, either immediate- or slow-release, improved any major sleep outcome in patients with AD. We were able to synthesize data for two sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59, two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03, two studies). Other outcomes were reported in single studies. We found no difference between intervention and control groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset or number of night-time awakenings, nor in cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies.Trazodone 50 mg administered at night for two weeks significantly improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0, one study) and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1, one study), but there was no clear evidence of any effect on the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6, one study) or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8, one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, nor on cognition or ADLs. No serious adverse effects were reported.Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment). The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects of ramelteon. We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in AD. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in AD, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin is beneficial to AD patients with moderate to severe dementia and sleep problems. There is some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in AD. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential. 
24582848	Retinoids as potential targets for Alzheimer's disease.
Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 20140226 2014May
Vitamin A and its derivatives, the retinoids, modulate several physiological and pathological processes through their interactions with nuclear retinoid receptor proteins termed as retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). An increasing body of evidence signifies the existence of retinoid signaling in diverse brain areas including cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum suggesting its involvement in adult brain functions. Defective retinoid signaling has been evidenced in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Reports demonstrate that vitamin A deprived mice exhibit serious defects in spatial learning and memory signifying its importance in the maintenance of memory functions. Retinoid signaling impacts the development of AD pathology through multiple pathways. Ligand activation of RAR and RXR in APP/PS1 transgenic mice ameliorated the symptoms of AD and reduced amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Retinoids also reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by astrocytes and the microglia. Studies also suggest that neuronal cell lines treated with retinoid agonists exhibit an up-regulation in the expression and activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Reports depict that retinoic acid isomers enhance, the expression of genes linked with cholesterol efflux e.g. apoe, abca-1 and abcg-1 proteins in astrocytes. Furthermore numerous studies also indicate antioxidant potential of retinoids. Through this review we concisely summarize the biology of retinoids, emphasizing on their probable neuroprotective mechanisms that will help to elucidate the pivotal role of these receptors in AD pathology.  
24240637	10-minute delayed recall from the modified mini-mental state test predicts Alzheimer's disease pathology.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
We compared the sensitivity and specificity of two delayed recall scores from the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) test with consensus clinical diagnosis to differentiate cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus non-AD pathologies. At a memory disorders clinic, 117 cognitively impaired patients were administered a baseline 3MS test and received a contemporaneous consensus clinical diagnosis. Their brains were examined after death about 5 years later. Using logistic regression with forward selection to predict pathologically defined AD versus non-AD, 10-min delayed recall entered first (p = 0.001), followed by clinical diagnosis (p = 0.02); 1-min delayed recall did not enter. 10-min delayed recall scores â‰¤4 (score range = 0-9) were 87% sensitive and 47% specific in predicting AD pathology; consensus clinical diagnosis was 82% sensitive and 45% specific. For the 57 patients whose initial Mini-Mental State Examination scores were â‰¥19 (the median), 3MS 10-min delayed recall scores â‰¤4 showed some loss of sensitivity (80%) but a substantial gain in specificity (77%). In conclusion, 10-min delayed recall score on the brief 3MS test distinguished between AD versus non-AD pathology about 5 years before death at least as well as consensus clinical diagnosis that requires much more comprehensive information and complex deliberation.  
24571830	Differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias using metabolic phenotypes on F-18 FDG PET/CT.
Neuroradiol J 20140224 2014Feb
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) can be used as a downstream marker of neuronal injury, a hallmark of neurodegenerative dementias. Characteristic patterns of regional glucose metabolism have been used to classify the dementia subtypes, namely Alzheimer's dementia (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), diffuse Lewy body (DLBD) and vascular dementia (VD). We undertook this study to assess the utility of FDG-PET in the differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes. One hundred and twenty-five patients diagnosed with dementia were referred from cognitive disorders and memory clinics of speciality neurology centres for the FDG-PET study. Imaging-based diagnosis of dementia type was established in 101 patients by visual assessment of individual scans by a PET physician blinded to the clinical diagnosis. The results were compared with an 18-month follow-up clinical assessment made by the specialist neurologist. Concordance of visual evaluation of FDG-PET scans with clinical diagnosis of the dementia type was achieved in 90% of patients scanned. This concordance was 93.4% for AD, 88.8% for FTD, 66.6% for DLBD and 92.3% for the other dementia syndromes. FDG-PET performed after the initial work-up of dementias is useful for supporting the clinical diagnosis of dementia subtype.  
24647946	Passive immunization with Tau oligomer monoclonal antibody reverses tauopathy phenotypes without affecting hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles.
J. Neurosci.  2014Mar19
Recent findings suggest that tau oligomers, which form before neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), are the true neurotoxic tau entities in neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies in animal models of tauopathy suggest that tau oligomers play a key role in eliciting behavioral and cognitive impairments. Here, we used a novel tau oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody (TOMA) for passive immunization in mice expressing mutant human tau. A single dose of TOMA administered either intravenously or intracerebroventricularly was sufficient to reverse both locomotor and memory deficits in a mouse model of tauopathy for 60 d, coincident with rapid reduction of tau oligomers but not phosphorylated NFTs or monomeric tau. Our data demonstrate that antibody protection is mediated by extracellular and rapid peripheral clearance. These findings provide the first direct evidence in support of a critical role for tau oligomers in disease progression and validate tau oligomers as a target for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative tauopathies.  
24669286	Early onset Alzheimer's disease and oxidative stress.
Oxid Med Cell Longev 20140114 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly adults. It is estimated that 10% of the world's population aged more than 60-65 years could currently be affected by AD, and that in the next 20 years, there could be more than 30 million people affected by this pathology. One of the great challenges in this regard is that AD is not just a scientific problem; it is associated with major psychosocial and ethical dilemmas and has a negative impact on national economies. The neurodegenerative process that occurs in AD involves a specific nervous cell dysfunction, which leads to neuronal death. Mutations in APP, PS1, and PS2 genes are causes for early onset AD. Several animal models have demonstrated that alterations in these proteins are able to induce oxidative damage, which in turn favors the development of AD. This paper provides a review of many, although not all, of the mutations present in patients with familial Alzheimer's disease and the association between some of these mutations with both oxidative damage and the development of the pathology.  
24669288	Oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease: why did antioxidant therapy fail?
Oxid Med Cell Longev 20140105 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, with increasing prevalence and no disease-modifying treatment available yet. A remarkable amount of data supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress is an early and important pathogenic operator in AD. However, all clinical studies conducted to date did not prove a clear beneficial effect of antioxidant treatment in AD patients. In the current work, we review the current knowledge about oxidative stress in AD pathogeny and we suggest future paths that are worth to be explored in animal models and clinical studies, in order to get a better approach of oxidative imbalance in this inexorable neurodegenerative disease.  
24672318	Apathy in Alzheimer's disease: any effective treatment?
ScientificWorldJournal 20140202 2014
This review has evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment of apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic literature search was conducted on published clinical trials assessing the effects of pharmacological treatment on apathy in AD over the last 10 years. Fourteen studies considered of good quality were included in the analysis (4 randomized controlled trials, 9 open-label studies, and 1 retrospective analysis). Cholinesterase inhibitors were investigated in 9 studies, monoaminergic compounds such as methylphenidate and modafinil in two trials and one trial, respectively, and Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761 extract) and citalopram in one study each. Cholinesterase inhibitors did not show statistical significant effect in 1 RCT study but were associated to improvement in 3 open-label studies. Methylphenidate elicited a small but significant activity accompanied by relevant side effects such as high blood pressure, cough, and osteoarticular pain. EGb 761 was well tolerated and countered apathy. Other treatments induced modest improvements or were ineffective. Apathy treatment remains a challenge and there is no evident advantage of any specific pharmacotherapy tested so far. The development of controlled studies according to updated guidelines for the diagnosis of apathy in patients with AD is desirable. 
24683436	Oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome: cause or consequence of Alzheimer's disease?
Oxid Med Cell Longev 20140120 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly. Clinically, it is characterized by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by the presence of extracellular Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) deposited as neuritic plaques (NP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) made of abnormal and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These lesions are capable of generating the neuronal damage that leads to cell death and cognitive failure through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Evidence indicates the critical role of AÎ² metabolism in prompting the oxidative stress observed in AD patients. However, it has also been proposed that oxidative damage precedes the onset of clinical and pathological AD symptoms, including amyloid-Î² deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, vascular malfunction, metabolic syndrome, and cognitive decline. This paper provides a brief description of the three main proteins associated with the development of the disease (AÎ², tau, and ApoE) and describes their role in the generation of oxidative stress. Finally, we describe the mitochondrial alterations that are generated by AÎ² and examine the relationship of vascular damage which is a potential prognostic tool of metabolic syndrome. In addition, new therapeutic approaches targeting ROS sources and metabolic support were reported.  
24429060	Subjective depressive mood and regional cerebral blood flow in mild Alzheimer's disease.
Int Psychogeriatr 20140116 2014May
Depressive symptoms are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increase the caregiver burden, although the etiology and pathologic mechanism of depressive symptoms in AD patients remain unclear. In this study, we tried to clarify the cerebral blood flow (CBF) correlates of subjective depressive symptoms in AD. Seventy-six consecutive patients with AD were recruited from outpatient units of the Memory Clinic of Okayama University Hospital. Subjective depressive symptoms were evaluated using the short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). All patients underwent brain SPECT with 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer, and the SPECT images were analyzed by the Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 program. No significant differences between groups with high and low GDS scores were found with respect to age, sex, years of education, and revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination scores. Compared to patients with low scores on GDS, patients with high scores showed significant hypoperfusion in the left inferior frontal region. The left inferior frontal region may be significantly involved in the pathogenesis of subjective depressive symptoms in AD. Subjective and objective depressive symptoms may have somewhat different neural substrates in AD. 
24729694	The genetics of Alzheimer's disease.
Clin Interv Aging 20140401 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.  
24778618	Age-related changes of protein SUMOylation balance in the AÎ²PP Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Pharmacol 20140407 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder that affects the central nervous system causing a severe neurodegeneration. This pathology affects an increasing number of people worldwide due to the overall aging of the human population. In recent years SUMO protein modification has emerged as a possible cellular mechanism involved in AD. Some of the proteins engaged in the physiopathological process of AD, like BACE1, GSK3-Î² tau, AÎ²PP, and JNK, are in fact subject to protein SUMO modifications or interactions. Here, we have investigated the SUMO/deSUMOylation balance and SUMO-related proteins during the onset and progression of the pathology in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. We examined four age-stages (1.5, 3, 6, 17 months old) and observed shows an increase in SUMO-1 protein conjugation at 3 and 6 months in transgenic mice with respect to WT in both cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly this is paralleled by increased expression levels of Ubc9 and SENP1 in both brain regions. At 6 months of age also the SUMO-1 mRNA resulted augmented. SUMO-2-ylation was surprisingly decreased in old transgenic mice and was unaltered in the other time windows. The fact that alterations in SUMO/deSUMOylation equilibrium occur from the early phases of AD suggests that global posttranslational modifications may play an important role in the mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis, thus providing potential targets for pharmacological interventions.  
24795838	Cognitive reserve and clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease: evidence and implications for brain PET imaging.
Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 20140425 2014
Cognitive reserve (CR) refers to the hypothesized capacity of an adult brain to cope with brain damage in order to minimize symptomatology. The present review is focused on the contribution of brain PET in the understanding of the influence of CR on the disassociation between cognition and degree of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Theories for the explanation CR-related mechanism as well as PET imaging evidence for the existence of CR are described. Moreover functional imaging studies investigating specific networks for CR both in healthy subjects and AD patients are discussed. Finally implications for amyloid PET imaging are presented.  
24795628	Deciphering the molecular profile of plaques, memory decline and neuron loss in two mouse models for Alzheimer's disease by deep sequencing.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140416 2014
One of the central research questions on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the elucidation of the molecular signatures triggered by the amyloid cascade of pathological events. Next-generation sequencing allows the identification of genes involved in disease processes in an unbiased manner. We have combined this technique with the analysis of two AD mouse models: (1) The 5XFAD model develops early plaque formation, intraneuronal AÎ² aggregation, neuron loss, and behavioral deficits. (2) The Tg4-42 model expresses N-truncated AÎ²4-42 and develops neuron loss and behavioral deficits albeit without plaque formation. Our results show that learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze and fear conditioning tasks in Tg4-42 mice at 12â€‰months of age are similar to the deficits in 5XFAD animals. This suggested that comparative gene expression analysis between the models would allow the dissection of plaque-related and -unrelated disease relevant factors. Using deep sequencing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and subsequently verified by quantitative PCR. Nineteen DEGs were identified in pre-symptomatic young 5XFAD mice, and none in young Tg4-42 mice. In the aged cohort, 131 DEGs were found in 5XFAD and 56 DEGs in Tg4-42 mice. Many of the DEGs specific to the 5XFAD model belong to neuroinflammatory processes typically associated with plaques. Interestingly, 36 DEGs were identified in both mouse models indicating common disease pathways associated with behavioral deficits and neuron loss.  
24360883	In Vivo direct reprogramming of reactive glial cells into functional neurons after brain injury and in an Alzheimer's disease model.
Cell Stem Cell 20131219 2014Feb6
Loss of neurons after brain injury and in neurodegenerative disease is often accompanied by reactive gliosis and scarring, which are difficult to reverse with existing treatment approaches. Here, we show that reactive glial cells in the cortex of stab-injured or Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice can be directly reprogrammed into functional neurons in vivo using retroviral expression of a single neural transcription factor, NeuroD1. Following expression of NeuroD1, astrocytes were reprogrammed into glutamatergic neurons, while NG2 cells were reprogrammed into glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Cortical slice recordings revealed both spontaneous and evoked synaptic responses in NeuroD1-converted neurons, suggesting that they integrated into local neural circuits. NeuroD1 expression was also able to reprogram cultured human cortical astrocytes into functional neurons. Our studies therefore suggest that direct reprogramming of reactive glial cells into functional neurons in vivo could provide an alternative approach for repair of injured or diseased brain. 
24676319	Current evidence for the use of coffee and caffeine to prevent age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.
J Nutr Health Aging  2014Apr
Although nothing has been proven conclusively to protect against cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease or related dementias, decades of research suggest that specific approaches including the consumption of coffee may be effective. While coffee and caffeine are known to enhance short-term memory and cognition, some limited research also suggests that long-term use may protect against cognitive decline or dementia. In vitro and pre-clinical animal models have identified plausible neuroprotective mechanisms of action of both caffeine and other bioactive components of coffee, though epidemiology has produced mixed results. Some studies suggest a protective association while others report no benefit. To our knowledge, no evidence has been gathered from randomized controlled trials. Although moderate consumption of caffeinated coffee is generally safe for healthy people, it may not be for everyone, since comorbidities and personal genetics influence potential benefits and risks. Future studies could include short-term clinical trials with biomarker outcomes to validate findings from pre-clinical models and improved epidemiological studies that incorporate more standardized methods of data collection and analysis. Given the enormous economic and emotional toll threatened by the current epidemic of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, it is critically important to validate potential prevention strategies such as coffee and caffeine.  
24676320	Perception of Alzheimer's disease in the French population.
J Nutr Health Aging  2014Apr
The aim of this study was to investigate the perception, knowledge, opinions and beliefs about AD in the French population to improve care for patients with Alzheimer's disease. A cross-sectional telephone survey in 2008. French "Alzheimer Plan 2008-2012". 2013 respondents, representative of the French population. The respondents answered a questionnaire in which they were presented with a series of attitudinal statements about health in general and AD. Main results are summarized as followed: (a) Respondents think that AD can be devastating for a family (93%). This devastating feeling prevails in the population &gt;75 years old and in people who know patient with AD. (b) General population has a reasonable knowledge about AD, but is still unable to recognize early stages: 95% of respondents considered that difficulties to manage administrative papers and find their way back home suggest early AD. (c) 91% of the population would like to know the diagnosis if they had AD. (d) 38% of the population know or have known at least one patient within their social circle. People think that the care of AD's patient can be better but they trust in the French government to improve it. General representation of AD is changing in a positive way and, even though AD is perceived as a calamity, people are confident that solutions will be found in the future. 
24677154	[Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease].
Rev Neurol  2014Apr1
The new diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) include brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, with the aim of increasing the certainty of whether a patient has an ongoing AD neuropathologic process or not. Three CSF biomarkers, AÃŸ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau, reflect the core pathological features of AD. It is already known that these pathological processes of AD starts decades before the first symptoms, so these biomarkers may provide means of early disease detection. At least three stages of AD could be identified: preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment due to AD, and dementia due to AD. In this review, we aim to summarize the CSF biomarker data available for each of these stages. We also review the actual research on blood-based biomarkers. Recent studies on healthy elderly subjects and on carriers of dominantly inherited AD mutations have also found biomarker changes that allow separate groups in these preclinical stages. These studies may aid for segregate populations in clinical trials and objectively evaluate if there are changes over the pathological processes of AD. Limits to widespread use of CSF biomarkers, apart from the invasive nature of the process itself, is the higher coefficient of variation for the analyses between centres. It requires strict pre-analytical and analytical procedures that may make feasible multi-centre studies and global cut-off points for the different stages of AD.  
24425352	Frontotemporal neural systems supporting semantic processing in Alzheimer's disease.
Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci  2014Mar
We hypothesized that semantic memory for object concepts involves both representations of visual feature knowledge in modality-specific association cortex and heteromodal regions that are important for integrating and organizing this semantic knowledge so that it can be used in a flexible, contextually appropriate manner. We examined this hypothesis in an fMRI study of mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants were presented with pairs of printed words and asked whether the words matched on a given visual-perceptual feature (e.g., guitar, violin: SHAPE). The stimuli probed natural kinds and manufactured objects, and the judgments involved shape or color. We found activation of bilateral ventral temporal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during semantic judgments, with AD patients showing less activation of these regions than healthy seniors. Moreover, AD patients showed less ventral temporal activation than did healthy seniors for manufactured objects, but not for natural kinds. We also used diffusion-weighted MRI of white matter to examine fractional anisotropy (FA). Patients with AD showed significantly reduced FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, which carry projections linking temporal and frontal regions of this semantic network. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that semantic memory is supported in part by a large-scale neural network involving modality-specific association cortex, heteromodal association cortex, and projections between these regions. The semantic deficit in AD thus arises from gray matter disease that affects the representation of feature knowledge and processing its content, as well as white matter disease that interrupts the integrated functioning of this large-scale network.  
24513386	In vivo pharmacological characterization of AC-3933, a benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroscience 20140208 2014Apr18
GABAergic neurons are known to inhibit neural transduction and therefore negatively affect excitatory neural circuits in the brain. We have previously reported that 5-(3-methoxyphenyl)-3-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,6-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one (AC-3933), a partial inverse agonist for the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR), reverses GABAergic inhibitory effect on cholinergic neurons, and thus enhances acetylcholine release from these neurons in rat hippocampal slices. In this study, we evaluated AC-3933 potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a disorder characterized by progressive decline mainly in cholinergic function. Oral administration of AC-3933 (0.01-0.03mg/kg) resulted in the amelioration of scopolamine-induced amnesia, as well as a shift in electroencephalogram (EEG) relative power characteristic of pro-cognitive cholinergic activators, such as donepezil. In addition, treatment with AC-3933 even at the high dose of 100mg/kg p.o. produced no seizure or anxiety, two major adverse effects of BzR inverse agonists developed in the past. These findings indicate that AC-3933 with its low risk for side effects may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  
24491520	A longitudinal study of gait function and characteristics of gait disturbance in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
Gait Posture 20140121 2014Apr
Walking in daily life places high demands on the interplay between cognitive and motor functions. A well-functioning dual-tasking ability is thus essential for walking safely. The aims were to study longitudinal changes in gait function during single- and dual-tasking over a period of two years among people with initially mild AD (n=21). Data were collected on three occasions, twelve months apart. An optical motion capture system was used for three-dimensional gait analysis. Gait parameters were examined at comfortable gait speed during single-tasking, dual-tasking naming names, and naming animals. The dual-task cost for gait speed was pronounced at baseline (names 26%, animals 35%), and remained so during the study period. A significant (p&lt;0.05) longitudinal decline in gait speed and step length during single- and dual-tasking was observed, whereas double support time, step width and step height showed inconsistent results. Systematic visual examination of the motion capture files revealed that dual-tasking frequently resulted in gait disturbances. Three main characteristics of such disturbances were identified: Temporal disturbance, Spatial disturbance and Instability in single stance. These aberrant gait performances may affect gait stability and increase the risk of falling. Furthermore, the observed gait disturbances can contribute to understanding and explaining previous reported gait variability among individuals with AD. However, the role that dual-task testing and aberrant dual-task gait performance play in the identification of individuals with early signs of cognitive impairment and in predicting fall risk in AD remains to be studied. 
24277156	Role of nuclear receptor on regulation of BDNF and neuroinflammation in hippocampus of Î²-amyloid animal model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurotox Res 20131126 2014May
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPAR-Î³) agonists have been reported to provide neuroprotective effects against neurodegenerative diseases. The current study was carried out to investigate the effects of chronic administration of pioglitazone, a PPAR-Î³ agonist, on cognitive impairment in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease induced by Î²-amyloid. Wistar rats received intracerebroventricular (ICV) Î²-amyloid (Î²A) application (3 nmol/3 Î¼L), and behavioral alterations (locomotor activity and memory performance) were assessed. Animals were sacrificed immediately following the last behavioral session, and their brains were removed and dissected. Mitochondrial enzymes, oxidative parameters, inflammatory mediators (TNF-Î±, IL-6), caspase activity, and BDNF levels were measured in the hippocampus. ICV Î²A-treated rats showed a memory deficit and significantly decreased BDNF level, simultaneously, increase in mitochondrial oxidative damage and inflammatory mediators in the hippocampus. Memory impairment and oxidative damage were reversed by administration of pioglitazone (15 and 30 mg/kg). Pioglitazone also significantly restored the BDNF level and attenuated the actions of inflammatory markers in ICV Î²A-treated rats. However, pretreatment with PPAR-Î³ antagonist BADGE (15 mg/kg) with higher dose of pioglitazone significantly reversed its protective action in memory impairment in Î²A-treated rats, which indicates the involvement of PPAR-Î³ receptors mediating neuroprotective action. These results demonstrate that pioglitazone offers protection against Î²-amyloid-induced memory dysfunction possibly due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic action and neurogenesis-like effect therefore, could have a therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease. 
24800502	[Biological markers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease].
Rinsho Byori  2014Mar
Dementia is a declined state of cognitive functions which impair daily and social life mainly caused by progressive neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease(AD). The present study showed that about 15% of patients in Japan aged over 65 have dementia. The important point regarding the diagnosis of dementia is to detect it as early as possible. It is critical for the diagnosis to measure the indicators in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Blood tests are useful to eliminate other factors that lead to cognitive decline derived from physical causes. CSF markers are significant for monitoring the existence and progression of neuropathologies. We need to accumulate extensive knowledge of the features, types, pathologies, development, and progress of dementia in order to assess patients and/or measured values. 
24401693	Stem cell derived basal forebrain cholinergic neurons from Alzheimer's disease patients are more susceptible to cell death.
Mol Neurodegener 20140108 2014
An early substantial loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) is a constant feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with deficits in spatial learning and memory. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with AD as well as from normal controls could be efficiently differentiated into neurons with characteristics of BFCNs. We used BFCNs derived from iPSCs to model sporadic AD with a focus on patients with ApoE3/E4 genotypes (AD-E3/E4). BFCNs derived from AD-E3/E4 patients showed typical AD biochemical features evidenced by increased AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratios. AD-E3/E4 neurons also exhibited altered responses to treatment with Î³-secretase inhibitors compared to control BFCNs or neurons derived from patients with familial AD. BFCNs from patients with AD-E3/E4 also exhibited increased vulnerability to glutamate-mediated cell death which correlated with increased intracellular free calcium upon glutamate exposure. The ability to generate BFCNs with an AD phenotype is a significant step both for understanding disease mechanisms and for facilitating screening for agents that promote synaptic integrity and neuronal survival.  
24576203	Household members of persons with Alzheimer's disease: health conditions, healthcare resource use, and healthcare costs.
J Am Geriatr Soc 20140227 2014Mar
To compare medical condition burden, healthcare resource use, and healthcare costs of household members (HHMs) of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with those of HHMs of matched individuals without AD. Retrospective cohort study based on administrative claims data collected between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011. Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plan. MAPD plan members with a diagnosis of AD (International Classification of Disease Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, code 331.0) were selected and linked to a HHM to form patient-HHM dyads. AD dyads were matched to non-AD dyads. Health-related endpoints, including medical condition burden, healthcare resource use, and direct healthcare costs, were measured during 36 months of continuous health plan enrollment. Individuals with AD (n = 1,861) were linked to HHMs (n = 1,861), and these AD dyads were matched to 1,861 non-AD patient-HHM dyads. AD HHMs had greater medical condition burden scores than non-AD HHMs, with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, insomnia, substance abuse or dependence, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatoid arthritis being more prevalent in AD HHMs. Emergency department and outpatient service use were more common in AD HHMs than in non-AD HHMs, and AD HHMs had greater healthcare costs. HHMs of individuals diagnosed with AD demonstrated greater medical condition burden, healthcare resource use, and direct healthcare costs than non-AD HHMs. These findings demonstrate the significant clinical and financial impact of AD on HHMs of individuals with AD. 
24671102	Effects of Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang and its modified formula on the modulation of amyloid-Î² precursor protein processing in Alzheimer's disease models.
PLoS ONE 20140326 2014
Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT) is a famous traditional Chinese herbal formula that has been widely used clinically to treat cerebral ischemia. Recently, we found that berberine, a major alkaloid compound in HLJDT, reduced amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) accumulation in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. In this study, we compared the effects of HLJDT, four single component herbs of HLJDT (Rhizoma coptidis (RC), Radix scutellariae (RS), Cortex phellodendri (CP) and Fructus gardenia (FG)) and the modified formula of HLJDT (HLJDT-M, which is free of RS) on the regulatory processing of amyloid-Î² precursor protein (APP) in an in vitro model of AD. Here we show that treatment with HLJDT-M and its components RC, CP, and the main compound berberine on N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells stably expressing human APP with the Swedish mutation (N2a-SwedAPP) significantly decreased the levels of full-length APP, phosphorylated APP at threonine 668, C-terminal fragments of APP, soluble APP (sAPP)-Î± and sAPPÎ²-Swedish and reduced the generation of AÎ² peptide in the cell lysates of N2a-SwedAPP. HLJDT-M showed more significant APP- and AÎ²- reducing effects than berberine, RC or CP treatment alone. In contrast, HLJDT, its component RS and the main active compound of RS, baicalein, strongly increased the levels of all the metabolic products of APP in the cell lysates. The extract from FG, however, did not influence APP modulation. Interestingly, regular treatment of TgCRND8 APP transgenic mice with baicalein exacerbated the amyloid plaque burden, APP metabolism and AÎ² production. Taken together, these data provide convincing evidence that HLJDT and baicalein treatment can increase the amyloidogenic metabolism of APP which is at least partly responsible for the baicalein-mediated AÎ² plaque increase in the brains of TgCRND8 mice. On the other hand, HLJDT-M significantly decreased all the APP metabolic products including AÎ². Further study of HLJDT-M for therapeutic use in treating AD is warranted.  
24671215	Molecular topology as novel strategy for discovery of drugs with aÎ² lowering and anti-aggregation dual activities for Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140326 2014
In this study, we demonstrate the use of Molecular topology (MT) in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug discovery program. MT uses and expands upon the principles governing the molecular connectivity theory of numerically characterizing molecular structures, in the present case, active anti-AD drugs/agents, using topological descriptors to build models. Topological characterization has been shown to embody sufficient molecular information to provide strong correlation to therapeutic efficacy. We used MT to include multiple bioactive properties that allows for the identification of multi-functional single agent compounds, in this case, the dual functions of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) -lowering and anti-oligomerization. Using this technology, we identified and designed novel compounds in chemical classes unrelated to current anti-AD agents that exert dual AÎ² lowering and anti-AÎ² oligomerization activities in animal models of AD. AD is a multifaceted disease with different pathological features. Our study, for the first time, demonstrated that MT can provide novel strategy for discovering drugs with AÎ² lowering and anti-aggregation dual activities for AD. 
24673788	Implications of a longitudinal cognitive intervention program in mild Alzheimer's disease.
Arch Psychiatr Nurs 20131219 2014Apr
The implications of a longitudinal (5 years) intervention program in a mild Alzheimer's disease (mAD) patient targeting mainly the language deficits were investigated. The program had 2 parts: the intensive one included training strategies and tasks that enhanced his impairments (memory, naming, comprehension), and the second one (the next 4 years), without guidelines or teaching. The first follow up (11 months later) showed significant improvements to memory, categorical verbal fluency, comprehension and written narrative ability even to untrained functions (behavior and functional ability). The second follow up (5 years later) showed retained improvement to delayed memory tasks, language and general cognitive state. Long life cognitive programs retrograde the mAD and seem to maintain the independence of the patient and make remote the possibility of the institutionalization. 
24676435	Treadmill training as an augmentation treatment for Alzheimer's disease: a pilot randomized controlled study.
Arq Neuropsiquiatr  2014Mar
To assess the effect of aerobic exercise on the cognition and functional capacity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Elderly (n=20) with mild dementia (NINCDS-ADRDA/CDR1) were randomly assigned to an exercise group (EG) on a treadmill (30 minutes, twice a week and moderate intensity of 60% VOâ‚‚max) and control group (GC) 10 patients. The primary outcome measure was the cognitive function using Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). Specifics instruments were also applied to evaluate executive function, memory, attention and concentration, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control and functional capacity. After 16 weeks, the EG showed improvement in cognition CAMCOG whereas the CG declined. Compared to the CG, the EG presented significant improvement on the functional capacity. The analysis of the effect size has shown a favorable response to the physical exercise in all dependent variables. Walking on treadmill may be recommended as an augmentation treatment for patients with AD. 
24676441	Biological markers of Alzheimer's disease.
Arq Neuropsiquiatr  2014Mar
The challenges for establishing an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have created a need for biomarkers that reflect the core pathology of the disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of total Tau (T-tau), phosphorylated Tau (P-Tau) and beta-amyloid peptide (AÎ²â‚„â‚‚) reflect, respectively, neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid pathologies and are considered as surrogate markers of AD pathophysiology. The combination of low AÎ²â‚„â‚‚ and high levels of T-tau and P-Tau can accurately identify patients with AD at early stages, even before the development of dementia. The combined analysis of the CSF biomarkers is also helpful for the differential diagnosis between AD and other degenerative dementias. The development of these CSF biomarkers has evolved to a novel diagnostic definition of the disease. The identification of a specific clinical phenotype combined with the in vivo evidence of pathophysiological markers offers the possibility to make a diagnosis of AD before the dementia stage with high specificity. 
24588972	The transdermal formulation of rivastigmine improves caregiver burden and treatment adherence of patients with Alzheimer's disease under daily practice conditions.
Int. J. Clin. Pract. 20140303 2014Apr
Rivastigmine is the only cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) available as transdermal patch. The patch was developed to improve gastrointestinal tolerability and treatment adherence to higher dosages as compared with oral medication. Preferences of patients and caregivers for the patch were reported; however, neither patient compliance nor caregiver burden has yet been measured under routine practice conditions. This was a prospective, multi-centre, observational study in patients with Alzheimer's disease treated with rivastigmine patch in Germany. To compare the transdermal with oral dosage forms, physicians were asked to enrol patients who recently switched from oral to transdermal medication. Beyond effectiveness and tolerability, outcome measures were drug adherence evaluated by the Morisky questionnaire, and caregiver burden, measured as the daily time expenditure for dressing the patient, controlling appearance and administration of medication. In total, 1104 outpatients (57.5% female gender; mean age 77Â Â±Â 7Â years) were enrolled in 220 sites. After 6Â months of treatment, 67.5% of patients had an improved Clinical Global Impression and the Mini-Mental State Examination score increased from 19.0Â Â±Â 5.1 to 20.0Â Â±Â 5.2 (pÂ &lt;Â 0.001); 84.1% of patients were still on treatment, 64.6% on the target dose of 9.5Â mg/day. Compliance and patient satisfaction with therapy continuously increased over the study period and average time savings of caregivers added up to 20Â min/day. In general, tolerability was deemed good and there were no unexpected adverse events. Transdermal rivastigmine is an effective treatment alternative, which may improve adherence and treatment satisfaction of the patient and relieve the caregiver. Controlled parallel-group trials are warranted. Clinical trials registration: none (observational study). 
24530172	CR1, ABCA7, and APOE genes affect the features of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20140131 2014Apr15
The genetic factors that determine the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have been rarely reported. We aimed to investigate the association between top hits of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and specific cognitive domains in AD patients. We investigated 86 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from 12 genes (ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, LRAT, MS4A6A, PCDH11X, and PICALM) based on results of the recent GWAS and genotyped in 211 AD cases. We also analyzed results of comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations in all cases. We performed multiple regression analyses. There were four significant associations between genotypes and phenotypes of AD patients: CR1 SNP rs11803956 correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (Î²=1.718, Pcorrected=0.002); ABCA7 SNP rs3752232 correlated with Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy score (Î²=-6.861, Pcorrected=0.013); APOE SNP rs2075650 correlated with the percentile of RCFT copy score (Î²=14.005, Pcorrected=0.021) and the percentile of total score in phonemic fluency (Î²=11.052, Pcorrected=0.035). Our results suggest that CR1, ABCA7, and APOE correlate with specific aspects of cognitive impairments in AD patients. 
24548486	The role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20140206 2014Apr15
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive disorder and memory dysfunction. This kind of cognitive impairment is closely related to synaptic plasticity, in which N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is one of the glutamate receptors, plays a critical role. Therefore the present study was designed to investigate whether the cognitive impairment of AD rat model has relation to the change of NMDAR. The adult male rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, AD and AD+APV (the competitive but not selective blocker of NMDAR) groups. The synaptic plasticity was measured by recording long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) in the perforant path (PP) to dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus. The spatial memory and reversal learning were examined by Morris water maze (MWM) test. Results showed that the spatial learning performance of MWM was significantly impaired in AD group compared to that of control group. Rats of APV group showed a higher LTP and better performance in spatial memory, but worse performance in reversal learning test and lower LTD than those of AD group. In conclusion, the high concentration of APV influenced LTD and enhanced LTP in AD rats through changing the proportion of NMDAR, which suggested that the change of NMDAR may participate in the pathogenesis of AD at the synaptic level.  
24487585	Angiotensin-converting enzyme overexpression in myelomonocytes prevents Alzheimer's-like cognitive decline.
J. Clin. Invest.  2014Mar3
Cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with elevated brain levels of amyloid Î² protein (AÎ²), particularly neurotoxic AÎ²(1-42). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) can degrade AÎ²(1-42), and ACE overexpression in myelomonocytic cells enhances their immune function. To examine the effect of targeted ACE overexpression on AD, we crossed ACE(10/10) mice, which overexpress ACE in myelomonocytes using the c-fms promoter, with the transgenic APP(SWE)/PS1(Î”E9) mouse model of AD (ADâ?º). Evaluation of brain tissue from these ADâ?ºACE(10/10) mice at 7 and 13 months revealed that levels of both soluble and insoluble brain AÎ²(1-42) were reduced compared with those in ADâ?º mice. Furthermore, both plaque burden and astrogliosis were drastically reduced. Administration of the ACE inhibitor ramipril increased AÎ² levels in ADâ?ºACE(10/10) mice compared with the levels induced by the ACE-independent vasodilator hydralazine. Overall, ADâ?ºACE(10/10) mice had less brain-infiltrating cells, consistent with reduced AD-associated pathology, though ACE-overexpressing macrophages were abundant around and engulfing AÎ² plaques. At 11 and 12 months of age, the ADâ?ºACE(10/WT) and ADâ?ºACE(10/10) mice were virtually equivalent to non-AD mice in cognitive ability, as assessed by maze-based behavioral tests. Our data demonstrate that an enhanced immune response, coupled with increased myelomonocytic expression of catalytically active ACE, prevents cognitive decline in a murine model of AD. 
24521259	Cognition in MCI and Alzheimer's disease: baseline data from a longitudinal study of the NTB.
Clin Neuropsychol 20140213 2014
Baseline data are summarized from a study examining the psychometric properties of the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) and its subtests, and correlating the NTB with other cognitive and functional assessments. A multicenter, longitudinal, non-interventional study included mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 196), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 70), or normal cognition participants (NC, n = 75). The NTB, other cognitive assessment tools, functional/behavioral questionnaires, and health outcome assessments were administered. At baseline composite NTB, NTB memory, and NTB executive function z-scores were significantly lower for participants with AD compared with MCI, and for participants with MCI compared with NC. The composite NTB z-score had high test-retest reliability between screening and baseline. The results of this study suggest that NTB exhibits good reliability in patients with mild to moderate AD and MCI.  
24486299	Trichostatin A increases the levels of plasma gelsolin and amyloid beta-protein in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Life Sci. 20140128 2014Mar18
Gelsolin (GSN), a multifunctional protein, binds to amyloid beta-protein (AÎ²), inhibits its fibrillization, solubilizes preformed AÎ² fibrils, and helps in its clearance from the brain. Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, induces the protein expression of gelsolin. In the present study, we investigated how TSA-treatment of APPswe/PS1Î´E9 transgenic (Tg) mice of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will affect the plasma levels of gelsolin and AÎ². TSA (5mg/kg body weight on alternate days for two months) was intraperitoneally injected to AD Tg mice. Gelsolin was measured by Western blotting and AÎ² was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. TSA-treatment significantly increased the levels of plasma gelsolin by 1.79-fold as compared with vehicle-treated control mice (p&lt;0.01). The levels of AÎ² 1-40 and AÎ² 1-42 in the plasma were also higher in TSA-treated mice in comparison with vehicle-treated mice. The treatment of transgenic AD mice with TSA did not affect the body weight in both male and female groups as compared to vehicle-treated animals. A positive correlation was observed between the plasma levels of gelsolin and AÎ² 1-40 (r=0.594, p=0.042) or AÎ² 1-42 (r=0.616, p=0.033) in AD Tg mice. These results suggest that TSA increases the levels of plasma gelsolin and AÎ² in AD Tg mice, which may have implications in gelsolin-mediated clearance of AÎ². 
24569075	Evidence that a synthetic amyloid-ÃŸ oligomer-binding peptide (ABP) targets amyloid-ÃŸ deposits in transgenic mouse brain and human Alzheimer's disease brain.
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 20140222 2014Mar14
The synthetic ~5 kDa ABP (amyloid-ÃŸ binding peptide) consists of a region of the 228 kDa human pericentrioloar material-1 (PCM-1) protein that selectively and avidly binds in vitro AÎ²1-42 oligomers, believed to be key co-drivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but not monomers (Chakravarthy et al., (2013) [3]). ABP also prevents AÃŸ1-42 from triggering the apoptotic death of cultured human SHSY5Y neuroblasts, likely by sequestering AÃŸ oligomers, suggesting that it might be a potential AD therapeutic. Here we support this possibility by showing that ABP also recognizes and binds AÎ²1-42 aggregates in sections of cortices and hippocampi from brains of AD transgenic mice and human AD patients. More importantly, ABP targets AÎ²1-42 aggregates when microinjected into the hippocampi of the brains of live AD transgenic mice. 
24626484	Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: promising therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease (Review).
Mol Med Rep 20140311 2014May
Activated monoamine oxidase (MAO) has a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the formation of amyloid plaques from amyloid Î² peptide (AÎ²) production and accumulation, formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive impairment via the destruction of cholinergic neurons and disorder of the cholinergic system. Several studies have indicated that MAO inhibitors improve cognitive deficits and reverse AÎ² pathology by modulating proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and decreasing AÎ² protein fragments. Thus, MAO inhibitors may be considered as promising therapeutic agents for AD.  
24164929	Neuropsychiatric symptoms and regional neocortical atrophy in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131027 2014Mar
To assess the relationship between regional neocortical atrophy and psychotic symptoms in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rates of change in regional neocortical atrophy as measured by longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans and the occurrence of psychotic symptoms and/or the long-term use of antipsychotic medications in 389 outpatients with MCI or AD in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Atrophy rate of 3 specific neocortical regions, lateral frontal, lateral parietal, and anterior cingulate gyrus, was significantly associated with the onset of psychosis including delusions, agitation, wandering, and hallucinations and/or the need for chronic antipsychotic medications. Atrophy rate of the lateral frontal lobe correlated most significantly with onset of psychotic symptoms or need for chronic antipsychotic medications. Psychosis was associated with volume loss in specific regions of the lateral frontal and parietal lobes as well as anterior cingulate gyrus. 
24164930	Cerebrospinal fluid Ï„ protein in differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in Chinese population: a meta-analysis.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131027 2014Mar
To assess whether biomarker Ï„ protein could differentiate between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). We conducted a comprehensive search to identify studies on Ï„ protein, patients with AD, and patients with VaD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ï„ protein levels were compared to discriminate among patients with AD, healthy controls, and patients with VaD by a meta-analysis. Patients with AD exhibit significantly higher CSF Ï„ protein levels than healthy controls or patients with VaD in the Chinese population. Our findings suggested that CSF Ï„ protein levels were found to be significantly associated with AD in the Chinese population. Measurement of Ï„ protein could help in attenuating the strict distinction between AD and VaD. 
24226465	Reverse Fox test for detecting visuospatial dysfunction corresponding to parietal hypoperfusion in mild Alzheimer's disease.

We developed a novel visuospatial clinical task to detect parietal dysfunction in mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). A total of 65 outpatients, including 47 with mild AD and 18 cognitively and neuroradiologically normal individuals with subjective memory impairment (NL), performed the "Reverse Fox" test and underwent brain single photon emission tomography. Patients with AD were divided into subgroups according to the results of the Reverse Fox test (successful vs unsuccessful). Success in the Reverse Fox test was achieved by 31.9% of patients with AD and 94.4% of NL. The unsuccessful AD subgroup had reduced perfusion of the medial parietal and bilateral temporoparietal regions compared with the successful AD subgroup. Failure in the Reverse Fox test was related to parietal hypoperfusion in patients with mild AD. Our findings suggest that the Reverse Fox test may be one of the useful supporting tools for detecting mild AD at outpatient clinic. 
24370616	A caregiver's wish list for a National Alzheimer's Agenda.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131226 2014Mar
When panels are convened to discuss the best way to deal with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the panels often consist of representatives from government agencies, national Alzheimer's organizations, medicine, research, and pharmaceutical companies. Although each of these stakeholder groups has much to contribute to such discussions, too often the voices of caregivers are not heard. Even the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) Advisory Council has only one full-time 24/7 caregiver as a member. Of 26 voices heard at the NAPA meetings, only 1 can speak for what life is like for a 24/7 caregiver of a loved one having AD. This article provides 10 items that I would raise at such a meeting based upon my own personal experience and what I have learned from others in my weekly spouse caregiver support group and in my online support groups. Some items suggest funding priorities, some suggest changes in how doctors currently diagnose and treat people with AD and their caregivers, and some suggest the need for more caregiver voices to be heard by government panels and politicians who have the power to effect change. 
24667905	Feasibility and efficacy of intensive cognitive training in early-stage Alzheimer's disease.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen  2014Mar
Cognitive training may be beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the effects are modest with little evidence of carryover. Prior studies included limited hours and low intensity of training. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and efficacy of many hours of intensive cognitive training with adults in the early stages of AD. Twenty-one adults with very mild or mild AD participated in cognitive training for 10 days over 2 weeks with 4 to 5 hours of training each day. Participants significantly improved in practiced computer-based tasks including those involving working memory, sustained attention, and switching attention. Outcome measures that improved included the Mini-Mental State Examination, letter fluency, and 3 of 5 Trail-Making Tests. Gains in outcome measures were maintained at 2- and 4-month follow-up. Adults in early-stage AD can participate in intensive cognitive training and make modest gains in both practiced and unpracticed cognitive tasks. 
24589176	Verbal fluency in cerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer's disease.
J Int Neuropsychol Soc 20140303 2014Apr
Patterns of verbal fluency deficits have been explored across different neurodegenerative disorders. This study sought to investigate the specific pattern of verbal fluency performance in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), which is the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment, and compare this with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants with SVD (n = 45), AD (n = 24) and healthy controls (n = 80) completed assessments of semantic and phonemic fluency. Mixed-model analyses of covariance were used to compare performance on the different fluency tasks between the groups, and a discriminant function analysis was conducted to examine group differentiation. The SVD group was impaired in both fluency tasks when compared to the controls. In contrast, the AD group displayed impairment in semantic fluency only. Discriminant function analysis revealed that fluency scores correctly classified 80% of SVD patients and 92% of AD patients. The pattern of performance observed in the SVD group may reflect deficits in executive function and processing speed impacting equivalently on semantic and phonemic fluency. The differences between the SVD and AD groups highlighted in this study may be useful for distinguishing between these conditions. 
24707173	Pattern of cerebral hyperperfusion in Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment using voxel-based analysis of 3D arterial spin-labeling imaging: initial experience.
Clin Interv Aging 20140326 2014
A three-dimensional (3D) continuous pulse arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique was used to investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Three groups were recruited for comparison, 24 AD patients, 17 MCI patients, and 21 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Three-dimensional ASL scans covering the entire brain were acquired with a 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner. Spatial processing was performed with statistical parametric mapping 8. A second-level one-way analysis of variance analysis (threshold at P&lt;0.05) was performed on the preprocessed ASL data. An average whole-brain CBF for each subject was also included as group-level covariates for the perfusion data, to control for individual CBF variations. Significantly increased CBF was detected in bilateral frontal lobes and right temporal subgyral regions in aMCI compared with controls. When comparing AD with aMCI, the major hyperperfusion regions were the right limbic lobe and basal ganglia regions, including the putamen, caudate, lentiform nucleus, and thalamus, and hypoperfusion was found in the left medial frontal lobe, parietal cortex, the right middle temporo-occipital lobe, and particularly, the left anterior cingulate gyrus. We also found decreased CBF in the bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital cortices and left limbic lobe in AD patients, relative to the control group. aMCI subjects showed decreased blood flow in the left occipital lobe, bilateral inferior temporal cortex, and right middle temporal cortex. Our results indicated that ASL provided useful perfusion information in AD disease and may be used as an appealing alternative for further pathologic and neuropsychological studies, especially of compensatory mechanisms for cerebral hypoperfusion. 
24527692	Lipoprotein-based nanoparticles rescue the memory loss of mice with Alzheimer's disease by accelerating the clearance of amyloid-beta.
ACS Nano 20140221 2014Mar25
Amyloid-beta (AÎ²) accumulation in the brain is believed to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and the common late-onset form of AD is characterized by an overall impairment in AÎ² clearance. Therefore, development of nanomedicine that can facilitate AÎ² clearance represents a promising strategy for AD intervention. However, previous work of this kind was concentrated at the molecular level, and the disease-modifying effectiveness of such nanomedicine has not been investigated in clinically relevant biological systems. Here, we hypothesized that a biologically inspired nanostructure, apolipoprotein E3-reconstituted high density lipoprotein (ApoE3-rHDL), which presents high binding affinity to AÎ², might serve as a novel nanomedicine for disease modification in AD by accelerating AÎ² clearance. Surface plasmon resonance, transmission electron microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that ApoE3-rHDL demonstrated high binding affinity to both AÎ² monomer and oligomer. It also accelerated the microglial, astroglial, and liver cell degradation of AÎ² by facilitating the lysosomal transport. One hour after intravenous administration, about 0.4% ID/g of ApoE3-rHDL gained access to the brain. Four-week daily treatment with ApoE3-rHDL decreased AÎ² deposition, attenuated microgliosis, ameliorated neurologic changes, and rescued memory deficits in an AD animal model. The findings here provided the direct evidence of a biomimetic nanostructure crossing the blood-brain barrier, capturing AÎ² and facilitating its degradation by glial cells, indicating that ApoE3-rHDL might serve as a novel nanomedicine for disease modification in AD by accelerating AÎ² clearance, which also justified the concept that nanostructures with AÎ²-binding affinity might provide a novel nanoplatform for AD therapy.  
24156269	The prediction of response to galantamine treatment in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Feb
The prediction of efficacy in long-term treatment of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) is a major clinical issue, although no consistently strong predictive factors have emerged thus far. The present analyses aimed to identify factors for predicting long-term outcome of galantamine treatment. Analyses were conducted with data from a 24 weeks randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of galantamine in the treatment of 303 patients with mild to moderate AD. Patients were divided into responders (4 or more point improvement of ADAScog scores at 24 weeks of treatment) and non-responders. We explored whether patients' background (e.g. sex, age, and duration of disease) and scores of cognitive scales at early stage, are relevant to the long-term response to AChEIs. Predictive values were estimated by the logistic regression model. The responder rate was 31.7%. We found that changes in scores of ADAS-J cog subscales between week 4 and baseline, especially word recognition, can be a good variable to predict subsequent response to galantamine, with approximately 75% of predictive performance. Characteristics of patients, including demographic characteristics, severity of disease and neuropsychological features before treatment were poorly predictive. The present study indicate that initial response to galantamine administration in patients with mild to moderate AD seems to be a reliable predictor of response of consequent galantamine treatment. Patients who show improvement of episodic memory function during the first 4 weeks of galantamine administration may be likely to particularly benefit from galantamine treatment.  
24359498	The novel multi-target iron chelator, M30 modulates HIF-1Î±-related glycolytic genes and insulin signaling pathway in the frontal cortex of APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mice.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Feb
Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of brain insulin/insulin receptor (InsR) and insulin signaling cascade are associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our group has designed and synthesized a series of multi-target iron chelating, brain permeable compounds for AD. One leading multi-target compound, M30 possesses the neuroprotective N-propargyl moiety of the anti-Parkinsonian, monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, rasagiline (AzilectÂ®) and the antioxidant-iron chelating moiety of an 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative of the iron chelator, VK28. Positive outcomes for the behavioral/cognitive and neuroprotective effects of M30 were recently obtained in preclinical experimental studies, regarding pathological aspects relevant to ageing and AD. We report that chronic treatment with M30 (1 and 5 mg/kg p.o; three times a week for 9 months) significantly elevated cortical insulin and InsR transcript and protein expression, respectively and increased the phosphorylated form of glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² in the frontal cortex of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double transgenic mice. In addition, M30 treatment upregulated the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î± and expression of its target genes involved in glycolysis including, aldolase A, enolase-1 and glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), in the frontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice. Treatment with M30 also lead to an increase in the hepatic protein expression levels of InsR and Glut-1 and lowered the increase in blood glucose levels following glucose tolerance test. The present findings indicate that the multifunctional iron chelating drug, M30 regulates major brain glucose metabolism parameters and thus, might be beneficial for AD, in which impaired neuronal insulin signaling and Glut expression have been implicated.  
24359502	A comparison of emotional decoding abilities in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, very mild and mild Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Feb
Deficits in emotional decoding abilities were described in patients with Alzheimer's dementia and amnestic type of mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI). However the pattern of decline and its dependency on the type of emotional stimuli has not been investigated so far. In our study, 5 sets of cartoon-like drawings portraying various human emotions of increasing complexity were presented to patients with very mild and mild Alzheimer's dementia, a-MCI and control subjects. Patients with Alzheimer's dementia, a-MCI and control subjects decoded emotions with similar accuracy. The pattern of decoding abilities was similar in Alzheimer's dementia, a-MCI patients and healthy control subjects. Decoding abilities depended on a manner the emotional stimuli were presented.  
24410630	Altered functional connectivity of the marginal division in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Feb
The marginal division (MrD) is a neostriatum subregion that links the limbic system and basal nucleus of Meynert; it is an important subcortical center that is involved in learning and memory. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. AD clinically manifests as gradually progressive cognitive decline with behavioral disorders. Prior to full dementia, AD patients typically experience a transient state, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Amnestic MCI individuals, but not all MCI individuals, frequently convert to AD dementia. To specify whether and how the functional relationships between the MrD and other brain regions change during AD, functional connectivity was assessed using resting-state functional MRI data and associated neuropsychological tests in AD and MCI patients (amnestic-type). Compared with normal controls, a different decreased functional connectivity pattern was observed between the MrD and caudate, the amygdala/parahippocampal region, the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum for AD/MCI patients. Moreover, the functional connectivity between the MrD and the identified regions was significantly correlated with the neuropsychological scores among the MCI and AD subjects. Our results suggest that the MrD functional network is disrupted during AD.  
24479629	Isolation and characterisation of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from Aquilaria subintegra for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Feb
Aquilaria subintegra, locally known as "Gaharu", belongs to the Thymelaeceae family. This plant's leaves have been claimed to be effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by Malay traditional practitioner in Malaysia. In this research, the chloroform extracts of the leaves and stem of A. subintegra were tested for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. The Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) results indicated the presence of phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids compounds in the extracts. Analysis of the stem chloroform extracts with LCMS/MS displayed that it contains kaempferol 3,4,7-trimethyl ether. The AChE inhibitory activity of leaves and stem chloroform extracts and kaempferol were 80%, 93% and 85.8%, respectively. The Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay (BSLA) exhibited low to moderate toxicity of the chloroform extract from leaves (LC50=531.18 Â± 49.53 Î¼g/ml), the stem chloroform extract (LC50=407.34 Â± 68.05 Î¼g/ml) and kaempferol (LC50=762.41 Â± 45.09 Î¼g/ml). The extracts and kaempferol were not cytotoxic to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human normal gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) and human normal hepatic cell line (WRL-68). The effect of leaf and stem chloroform extracts and kaempferol were determined in the Radial Arm Maze (RAM) after administration by oral gavage to ICR male and female mice with valium-impaired memory. Administration of kaempferol to the mice significantly reduced the number of repeated entries into the arms of maze in males and females. In conclusion, the inhibition of AChE by leaf and stem chloroform extracts of A. subintegra could be due to the presence of kaempferol. This extract is safe for use as a natural AChE inhibitor as an alternative to berberine for the treatment of AD.  
24479631	Butyrylcholinesterase K and apolipoprotein Îµ4 affect cortical thickness and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Feb
Two major genotypes are known to affect the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its response to cholinesterase inhibitors: the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and butyrylcholinesterase genes (BChE). This study analyzed the effects of the BChE and ApoE genotypes on the cortical thickness of patients with AD and examined how these genotypes affect the neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD. AD-drug-naÃ¯ve patients who met the probable AD criteria proposed by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association were recruited. Of 96 patients with AD, 65 were eligible for cortical thickness analysis. 3D T1-weighted images were acquired, and the cortical regions were segmented using the constrained Laplacian-based automated segmentation with proximities (CLASP) algorithm. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were measured by Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores. BChE wild-type carriers (BChE-W) showed more thinning in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, including the lateral premotor regions and anterior cingulate cortex, than did BChE-K variant carriers (BChE-K). ApoE-Îµ4 carriers had a thinner left medial prefrontal cortex, left superior frontal cortex, and left posterior cingulate cortex than did ApoE-Îµ4 non-carriers. Statistical analyses revealed that BChE-K carriers showed significantly less severe aberrant motor behavioral symptoms and that Îµ4 non-carriers showed less severe anxiety and indifference symptoms. The current findings show that, similar to ApoE-Îµ4 non-carriers, BChE-K carriers are protected from the pathological detriments of AD that affect frontal cortical thickness and neuropsychiatric symptoms. This study visually demonstrated the effects of the BChE-K and ApoE genotypes on the structural degeneration and complex aspects of the symptoms of AD.  
24388797	A combined effect of two Alzheimer's risk genes on medial temporal activity during executive attention in young adults.
Neuropsychologia 20140102 2014Apr
A recent history of failed clinical trials suggests that waiting until even the early stages of onset of Alzheimer's disease may be too late for effective treatment, pointing to the importance of early intervention in young people. Early intervention will require markers of Alzheimer's risk that track with genotype but are capable of responding to treatment. Here, we sought to identify a functional MRI signature of combined Alzheimer's risk imparted by two genetic risk factors. We used a task of executive attention during fMRI in participants genotyped for two Alzheimer's risk alleles: APOE-Îµ4 and CLU-C. Executive attention is a sensitive indicator of the progression of Alzheimer's even in the early stages of mild cognitive impairment, but has not yet been investigated as a marker of Alzheimer's risk in young adults. Functional MRI revealed that APOE-Îµ4 and CLU-C had an additive effect on brain activity such that increased combined genetic risk was associated with decreased brain activity during executive attention, including in the medial temporal lobe, a brain area affected early in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. 
24663666	Evidence of trem2 variant associated with triple risk of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140324 2014
Alzheimer's disease is one of the main causes of dementia among elderly individuals and leads to the neurodegeneration of different areas of the brain, resulting in memory impairments and loss of cognitive functions. Recently, a rare variant that is associated with 3-fold higher risk of Alzheimer's disease onset has been found. The rare variant discovered is a missense mutation in the loop region of exon 2 of Trem2 (rs75932628-T, Arg47His). The aim of this study was to investigate the evidence for potential structural and functional significance of Trem2 gene variant (Arg47His) through molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed the alteration caused due to the variant in TREM2 protein has significant effect on the ligand binding affinity as well as structural configuration. Based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation under salvation, the results confirmed that native form of the variant (Arg47His) might be responsible for improved compactness, hence thereby improved protein folding. Protein simulation was carried out at different temperatures. At 300K, the deviation of the theoretical model of TREM2 protein increased from 2.0 Ã… at 10 ns. In contrast, the deviation of the Arg47His mutation was maintained at 1.2 Ã… until the end of the simulation (tâ€Š=â€Š10 ns), which indicated that Arg47His had reached its folded state. The mutant residue was a highly conserved region and was similar to "immunoglobulin V-set" and "immunoglobulin-like folds". Taken together, the result from this study provides a biophysical insight on how the studied variant could contribute to the genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease.  
23965289	Greater medial temporal hypometabolism and lower cortical amyloid burden in ApoE4-positive AD patients.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. 20130821 2014Mar
Apolipoprotein E Îµ4 (ApoE4) has been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid deposition and hypometabolism. ApoE4 is less prevalent in non-amnestic AD variants suggesting a direct effect on the clinical phenotype. However, the impact of ApoE4 on amyloid burden and glucose metabolism across different clinical AD syndromes is not well understood. We aimed to assess the relationship between amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism and ApoE4 genotype in a clinically heterogeneous population of AD patients. 52 patients with probable AD (National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association) underwent [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans. All patients had positive PIB-PET scans. 23 were ApoE4 positive (ApoE4+) (14 heterozygous and 9 homozygous) and 29 were ApoE4 negative (ApoE4-). Groups consisted of language-variant AD, visual-variant AD and AD patients with amnestic and dysexecutive deficits. 52 healthy controls were included for comparison. FDG and PIB uptake was compared between groups on a voxel-wise basis and in regions of interest. While PIB patterns were diffuse in both patient groups, ApoE4- patients showed higher PIB uptake than ApoE4+ patients across the cortex. Higher PIB uptake in ApoE4- patients was particularly significant in right lateral frontotemporal regions. In contrast, similar patterns of hypometabolism relative to controls were found in both patient groups, mainly involving lateral temporoparietal cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus. Comparing patient groups, ApoE4+ subjects showed greater hypometabolism in bilateral medial temporal and right lateral temporal regions, and ApoE4- patients showed greater hypometabolism in cortical areas, including supplementary motor cortex and superior frontal gyrus. ApoE4+ AD patients showed lower global amyloid burden and greater medial temporal hypometabolism compared with matched ApoE4- patients. These findings suggest that ApoE4 may increase susceptibility to molecular pathology and modulate the anatomic pattern of neurodegeneration in AD. 
24322484	Facilitating Alzheimer disease research recruitment.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jan-Mar
Alzheimer disease (AD) research faces challenges to successful enrollment, especially to clinical trials and biomarker studies. Failure to recruit the planned number of participants in a timely manner threatens the internal validity and success of clinical research, raising concerns about external validity and generalizability of results, and possibly leading to disparities in disease treatment. Methods to improve recruitment exist, but require varying levels of staff effort and financial resources, and evidence of effectiveness is often lacking or inconsistent. In this review, we summarize some of the available methods to improve AD research recruitment, the available literature to support or refute these strategies, and some of the experiences at the authors' AD Research Centers. We discuss the use of community-based participatory research principles and participant registries as a means to enhance research enrollment and increase diversity of research samples.  
23840054	Measuring cognitive change in subjects with prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. 20130709 2014Apr
To investigate the sensitivity of a large set of neuropsychological tests to detect cognitive changes due to prodromal Alzheimer's disease(AD); to compare their metrological properties in order to select a restricted number of these tests for the longitudinal follow-up of subjects with prodromal AD. 212 patients with mild cognitive impairment were tested at baseline by a standardised neuropsychological battery, which included: the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test (FCSRT), the Benton Visual Retention test, the Deno100, verbal fluency, a serial digit learning test, the double task of Baddeley, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) similarities, the Trail-Making Test and the WAIS digit symbol test. Patients were monitored every 6 months for up to 3 years in order to identify those who converted to AD (retrospectively classified as prodromal AD). Statistical analyses were performed using a nonlinear multivariate mixed model involving a latent process. This model assumes that the psychometric tests are nonlinear transformations of a common latent cognitive process, and it captures the metrological properties of tests. 57 patients converted to AD. The most sensitive tests in the detection of cognitive changes due to prodromal AD were the FCSRT, the semantic verbal fluency and the Deno100. Some tests exhibited a higher sensitivity to cognitive changes for subjects with high levels of cognition, such as the free recall, delayed free recall scores of the FCSRT and the semantic verbal fluency, whereas others showed a higher sensitivity at low levels of cognition, such as the total recall score of the FCSRT. Tests used for the follow-up of prodromal AD subjects should be chosen among those that actually decline in this stage of the disease and should be selected according to the subject's initial scores. 
24133289	Apathy correlates with prefrontal amyloid Î² deposition in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. 20131016 2014Apr
Neuropsychiatric symptoms affect many patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). ((11)C)Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) has enabled the in vivo visualisation of brain amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposition. This study exploratively investigated the correlation between brain AÎ² deposition measured by ((11)C)PIB PET and neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. Participants were 28 patients (15 women, 13 men) with PIB-positive AD. Clinical assessments included Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating scale, neuropsychiatry inventory (NPI) and frontal assessment battery. All patients underwent three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI and ((11)C)PIB PET. The distribution volume ratio (DVR), an index of ((11)C)PIB retention and, thus, AÎ² deposition, was estimated voxel by voxel from ((11)C)PIB PET data with partial volume correction. Voxel-based correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationships between DVR and each NPI subscale. Additionally, voxel-based analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the DVR images was performed between Patients with AD with and without each neuropsychiatric symptom. Voxel-based morphometry analysis of MRI was also performed. Apathy subscale was correlated with ((11)C)PIB retention in the bilateral frontal and right anterior cingulate. ((11)C)PIB retention was greater in the bilateral frontal cortex of patients with AD with apathy than those of without apathy. Overlapping areas between the two analyses were the bilateral orbitofrontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. Other NPI subscales were not correlated with ((11)C)PIB retention. Voxel-based morphometry analysis of MRI showed no significant cluster of correlation between grey matter volume and NPI subscales. This study revealed that prefrontal AÎ² deposition correlates with apathy. 
23478745	Gene knockout of 5-lipoxygenase rescues synaptic dysfunction and improves memory in the triple-transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Psychiatry 20130312 2014Apr
5-Lipoxygenase (5LO) is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in vivo modulates the amyloidotic phenotype of amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. However, no data are available on the effects that 5LO has on synaptic function, integrity and cognition. To address this issue, we used a genetic and a pharmacological approach by generating 3 Ã— Tg mice deficient for 5LO and administering 3 Ã— Tg mice with a 5LO inhibitor. Compared with controls, we found that even before the development of overt neuropathology, both animals manifested significant memory improvement, rescue of their synaptic dysfunction and amelioration of synaptic integrity. In addition, later in life, these mice had a significant reduction of AÎ² and tau pathology. Our findings support a novel functional role for 5LO in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory. They establish this protein as a pleiotropic contributor to the development of the full spectrum of the AD phenotype, making it a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.  
23628985	A blood-based predictor for neocortical AÎ² burden in Alzheimer's disease: results from the AIBL study.
Mol. Psychiatry 20130430 2014Apr
Dementia is a global epidemic with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the leading cause. Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD is now becoming an international priority. Neocortical AÎ² (extracellular Î²-amyloid) burden (NAB), as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), represents one such marker for early identification. These scans are expensive and are not widely available, thus, there is a need for cheaper and more widely accessible alternatives. Addressing this need, a blood biomarker-based signature having efficacy for the prediction of NAB and which can be easily adapted for population screening is described. Blood data (176 analytes measured in plasma) and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET measurements from 273 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were utilised. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the difference of plasma measures between high and low NAB groups, and cross-validated machine-learning models were generated for predicting NAB. These models were applied to 817 non-imaged AIBL subjects and 82 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for validation. Five analytes showed significant difference between subjects with high compared to low NAB. A machine-learning model (based on nine markers) achieved sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 82%, respectively, for predicting NAB. Validation using the ADNI cohort yielded similar results (sensitivity 79% and specificity 76%). These results show that a panel of blood-based biomarkers is able to accurately predict NAB, supporting the hypothesis for a relationship between a blood-based signature and AÎ² accumulation, therefore, providing a platform for developing a population-based screen.  
24730256	Nanocarrier-based approaches for treatment and detection of Alzheimer's disease.
J Nanosci Nanotechnol  2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurological disorder in people over the age of 65. It has been estimated that in 2010 there were 4.7 million individuals aged 65 years or older with AD dementia, and it is projected that the total number of individuals with AD dementia in 2050 will be 13.8 million. The most commonly believed cause and most frequently studied aspect of AD is the aggregation of beta amyloid (Abeta), both as soluble Abeta and in the form of extracellular plaque. Treatment options are limited mainly due to the inability of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. Nanoparticulate drug carriers that have been targeted to the brain are able to pass through by virtue of their size, surface potential, surface coatings (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polysorbate), surface decoration with ligands or antibodies attached toward the receptors on the blood-brain barrier. Herein, we discuss the current front-runner nanocarriers under investigation for effective delivery of pharmaceuticals active in the treatment and detection of AD and their mechanisms and discuss a few of the outstanding studies. 
24389031	The multi-functional drug tropisetron binds APP and normalizes cognition in a murine Alzheimer's model.
Brain Res. 20131231 2014Mar10
Tropisetron was identified in a screen for candidates that increase the ratio of the trophic, neurite-extending peptide sAPPÎ± to the anti-trophic, neurite-retractive peptide AÎ², thus reversing this imbalance in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We describe here a hierarchical screening approach to identify such drug candidates, moving from cell lines to primary mouse hippocampal neuronal cultures to in vivo studies. By screening a clinical compound library in the primary assay using CHO-7W cells stably transfected with human APPwt, we identified tropisetron as a candidate that consistently increased sAPPÎ±. Secondary assay testing in neuronal cultures from J20 (PDAPP, huAPP(Swe/Ind)) mice showed that tropisetron consistently increased the sAPPÎ±/AÎ² 1-42 ratio. In in vivo studies in J20 mice, tropisetron improved the sAPPÎ±/AÎ² ratio along with spatial and working memory in mice, and was effective both during the symptomatic, pre-plaque phase (5-6 months) and in the late plaque phase (14 months). This ameliorative effect occurred at a dose of 0.5mg/kg/d (mkd), translating to a human-equivalent dose of 5mg/day, the current dose for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Although tropisetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and an Î±7nAChR partial agonist, we found that it also binds to the ectodomain of APP. Direct comparison of tropisetron to the current AD therapeutics memantine (Namenda) and donepezil (Aricept), using similar doses for each, revealed that tropisetron induced greater improvements in memory and the sAPPÎ±/AÎ²1-42 ratio. The improvements observed with tropisetron in the J20 AD mouse model, and its known safety profile, suggest that it may be suitable for transition to human trials as a candidate therapeutic for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and therefore it has been approved for testing in clinical trials beginning in 2014.  
24507620	Immunostimulant patches containing Escherichia coli LT enhance immune responses to DNA- and recombinant protein-based Alzheimer's disease vaccines.
J. Neuroimmunol. 20140115 2014Mar15
Immunotherapeutic approaches to treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) using vaccination strategies must overcome the obstacle of achieving adequate responses to vaccination in the elderly. Here we demonstrate for the first time that application of the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin adjuvant-laden immunostimulatory patches (LT-IS) dramatically enhances the onset and magnitude of immune responses to DNA- and protein-based vaccines for Alzheimer's disease following intradermal immunization via gene gun and conventional needles, respectively. Our studies suggest that the immune activation mediated by LT-IS offers improved potency for generating AD-specific vaccination responses that should be investigated as an adjuvant in the clinical arena.  
24284732	In vivo optical signatures of neuronal death in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Lasers Surg Med 20131128 2014Jan
There currently is a need for cost-effective, quantitative techniques to evaluate the gradual progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Measurement techniques based on diffuse optical spectroscopy can detect blood perfusion and brain cellular composition changes, through measuring the absorption (Âµa ) and reduced scattering (Âµs ') coefficients, respectively, using non-ionizing near-infrared light. Previous work has shown that brain perfusion deficits in an AD mouse model can be detected. The objective of this study was to determine if Âµs ' is sensitive to the inflammation and neuron death found in AD. We used spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to form quantitative maps of Âµa and Âµs ' in 3-month old male CaM/Tet-DTA mice harboring transgenes for the doxycyline-regulated neuronal expression of diphtheria toxin. When doxycycline is removed from the diet, CaM/Tet-DTA mice develop progressive neuronal loss in forebrain neurons. Mice (nâ€‰=â€‰5) were imaged longitudinally immediately prior to and after 23 days of lesion induction, and Âµa and Âµs ' (30 wavelengths, 650-970â€‰nm) were compared to properties obtained from Tet-DTA controls (nâ€‰=â€‰5). Neuron death and infiltration of inflammatory cells in brain cortical slices was confirmed with immunohistochemistry. No significant difference in baseline scattering and absorption were measured between CaM/Tet-DTA mice and controls. After 23 days of lesion induction, brain cortical Âµs ' was 11-16% higher in the CaM/Tet-DTA mice than in controls (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.03). Longitudinal imaging showed no significant difference in Âµs ' between the first and 23rd day of imaging in controls. Removing doxycycline from the diet was associated with a significant decrease in total hemoglobin concentrations (119â€‰Â±â€‰9â€‰ÂµM vs. 91â€‰Â±â€‰8â€‰ÂµM) (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) in controls, but not in CaM/Tet-DTA mice. Neuronal death and brain inflammation are associated with increased tissue scattering (Âµs ') and this optical biomarker may be useful in pre-clinical AD therapy evaluation or monitoring of disease progression in AD patients. 
24646282	From epidemiology to pathophysiology: what about caffeine in Alzheimer's disease?
Biochem. Soc. Trans.  2014Apr
AD (Alzheimer's disease) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the aged population. Definitive diagnosis of AD is based on the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are identified in post-mortem brain specimens. A third pathological component is inflammation. AD results from multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. Among other factors, epidemiological studies report beneficial effects of caffeine, a non-selective antagonist of adenosine receptors. In the present review, we discuss the impact of caffeine and the adenosinergic system in AD pathology as well as consequences in terms of pathology and therapeutics.  
24646283	Insulin, incretins and other growth factors as potential novel treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Biochem. Soc. Trans.  2014Apr
Recently, it has been shown that in patients with AD (Alzheimer's disease) and, to some degree, in patients with PD (Parkinson's disease) insulin signalling is impaired. This finding has initiated a range of research projects that showed remarkable improvements using treatments that initially had been developed to treat diabetes. Pre-clinical studies showed good neuroprotective effects when applying insulin or long-lasting analogues of incretin peptides. In transgenic animal models of AD and PD, analogues of the incretin GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) prevented neurodegenerative processes and improved neuronal and synaptic functionality in AD and PD. Amyloid plaque load and synaptic loss as well as cognitive impairment had been ameliorated in AD models, and dopaminergic loss of transmission and motor function was reversed in models of PD. On the basis of these promising findings, several clinical trials are being conducted with the first encouraging clinical results being published. In several pilot studies in AD patients, the nasal application of insulin showed encouraging effects on cognition and biomarkers. A pilot study in PD patients testing a GLP-1 receptor agonist that is currently on the market as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes also showed encouraging effects. Several other clinical trials are currently ongoing in AD patients. The present review summarizes the range of neuroprotective effects that these drugs have demonstrated and emphasizes the great promise that this approach has in providing novel treatments that have protective and even restorative properties that no current drug treatment can offer. 
24552807	Senescence-accelerated OXYS rats: a model of age-related cognitive decline with relevance to abnormalities in Alzheimer disease.
Cell Cycle 20140217 2014Mar15
Senescence-accelerated OXYS rats are an experimental model of accelerated aging that was established from Wistar stock via selection for susceptibility to cataractogenic effects of a galactose-rich diet and via subsequent inbreeding of highly susceptible rats. Currently, we have the 102nd generation of OXYS rats with spontaneously developing cataract and accelerated senescence syndrome, which means early development of a phenotype similar to human geriatric disorders, including accelerated brain aging. In recent years, our group found strong evidence that OXYS rats are a promising model for studies of the mechanisms of brain aging and neurodegenerative processes similar to those seen in Alzheimer disease (AD). The manifestation of behavioral alterations and learning and memory deficits develop since the fourth week of age, i.e., simultaneously with first signs of neurodegeneration detectable on magnetic resonance imaging and under a light microscope. In addition, impaired long-term potentiation has been demonstrated in OXYS rats by the age of 3 months. With age, neurodegenerative changes in the brain of OXYS rats become amplified. We have shown that this deterioration happens against the background of overproduction of amyloid precursor protein (AÎ²PP), accumulation of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²), and hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein in the hippocampus and cortex. The development of AMD-like retinopathy in OXYS rats is also accompanied by increased accumulation of AÎ² in the retina. These published data suggest that the OXYS strain may serve as a spontaneous rat model of AD-like pathology and could help to decipher the pathogenesis of AD.  
24650065	Factors associated with increased caregivers' burden in several cognitive stages of Alzheimer's disease.
Geriatr Gerontol Int  2014Apr
To investigate factors associated with caregiver burden (CB) in persons caring for older adults with various cognitive stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants were 1127 outpatients and their caregivers. Participants comprised 120 older adults with normal cognition (NC), 126 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 881 with AD. AD patients were subclassified into four groups by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: AD29-24 (n = 117), AD23-18 (n = 423), AD17-12 (n = 254) and AD11-0 (n = 87). Participants and their caregivers underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment batteries including Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) Barthel Index, Lawton Index, Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale (DBD) to evaluate CB, Instrumental and Basic Activity of Daily Living (IADL/BADL), and Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). The comorbidity of geriatric syndrome and the living situation of the patient/caregiver were also assessed. ZBI score was higher in patients with lower MMSE score. Multivariate regression analysis identified that DBD was consistently associated with CB in all patients; symptoms related to memory deficit were related to CB in aMCI; differential IADL, such as inability to use a telephone, use transportation, manage finances, shop, cook and take responsibility for own medication, were related to CB in AD29-24, AD23-18 and AD17-12, and geriatric syndrome including falls and motor disturbance, sleep problems, urinary incontinence, and fatigue was related to CB in AD23-18 and AD17-12. Multiple factors including BPSD, impaired life function and geriatric syndrome were cognitive stage-dependently associated with CB. Preventive treatment of BPSD and comorbidity, and effective assistance for IADL deficits could contribute to alleviation of CB. 
24650067	Differential subtypes of diabetic older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
Geriatr Gerontol Int  2014Apr
The clinical management of diabetic elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hindered by several difficulties. The present study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics and pathophysiological properties of AD in diabetic older adults. A total of 91 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 161 non-diabetic individuals who were diagnosed with AD were recruited. Diabetic patients were classified into two groups with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt; 7.0% or â‰¥ 7.0%. The demographics, cognition, daily-life function, metabolic changes, treatment, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as well as brain pathophysiology, were compared among the three groups. Patients with higher HbA1c had increased diabetic vascular complications and impaired activities of daily living with decreased levels of serum high-molecular-weight adiponectin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Although cognitive status was similar among the three groups, BPSD, including apathy, overeating and excessive daytime sleeping appeared to be increased in the patients with HbA1c â‰¥ 7.0%. The frequency of apolipoprotein E4 carriers and of posterior cerebral hypoperfusion (AD-pattern) on single-photon emission computed tomography in poorly controlled diabetic subjects was similar to that in non-diabetic AD patients, whereas diabetic patients with HbA1c &lt;7.0% included fewer apolipoprotein E4 carriers and fewer patients with an AD pattern on single-photon emission computed tomography. Subtypes of older diabetic patients with AD were identified based on clinical features and brain pathophysiology. Physical and psychological complications of dementia are prevalent in patients with higher HbA1c. It seems likely that difficulties in the management of diabetes with AD are due not only to non-adherence to diabetes treatment, but also several symptoms and pathophysiological characteristics of dementia. 
23418130	Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease are related to functional connectivity alterations in the salience network.
Hum Brain Mapp 20130218 2014Apr
Neuropsychiatric syndromes are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their neurobiology is not completely understood. New methods in functional magnetic resonance imaging, such as intrinsic functional connectivity or "resting-state" analysis, may help to clarify this issue. Using such approaches, alterations in the default-mode and salience networks (SNs) have been described in Alzheimer's, although their relationship with specific symptoms remains unclear. We therefore carried out resting-state functional connectivity analysis with 20 patients with mild to moderate AD, and correlated their scores on neuropsychiatric inventory syndromes (apathy, hyperactivity, affective syndrome, and psychosis) with maps of connectivity in the default mode network and SN. In addition, we compared network connectivity in these patients with that in 17 healthy elderly control subjects. All analyses were controlled for gray matter density and other potential confounds. Alzheimer's patients showed increased functional connectivity within the SN compared with controls (right anterior cingulate cortex and left medial frontal gyrus), along with reduced functional connectivity in the default-mode network (bilateral precuneus). A correlation between increased connectivity in anterior cingulate cortex and right insula areas of the SN and hyperactivity syndrome (agitation, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, euphoria, and disinhibition) was found. These findings demonstrate an association between specific network changes in AD and particular neuropsychiatric symptom types. This underlines the potential clinical significance of resting state alterations in future diagnosis and therapy. 
23670951	Common and unique gray matter correlates of episodic memory dysfunction in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Brain Mapp 20130514 2014Apr
Conflicting evidence exists regarding the integrity of episodic memory in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Recent converging evidence suggests that episodic memory in progressive cases of bvFTD is compromised to the same extent as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying neural substrates of these episodic memory deficits, however, likely differ contingent on dementia type. In this study we sought to elucidate the neural substrates of episodic memory performance, across recall and recognition tasks, in both patient groups using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses. We predicted that episodic memory dysfunction would be apparent in both patient groups but would relate to divergent patterns of neural atrophy specific to each dementia type. We assessed episodic memory, across verbal and visual domains, in 19 bvFTD, 18 AD patients, and 19 age- and education-matched controls. Behaviorally, patient groups were indistinguishable for immediate and delayed recall, across verbal and visual domains. Whole-brain VBM analyses revealed regions commonly implicated in episodic retrieval across groups, namely the right temporal pole, right frontal lobe, left paracingulate gyrus, and right anterior hippocampus. Divergent neural networks specific to each group were also identified. Whereas a widespread network including posterior regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex, parietal and occipital cortices was exclusively implicated in AD, the frontal and anterior temporal lobes underpinned the episodic memory deficits in bvFTD. Our results point to distinct neural changes underlying episodic memory decline specific to each dementia syndrome. 
23670960	Callosal degeneration topographically correlated with cognitive function in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia.
Hum Brain Mapp 20130514 2014Apr
Degeneration of the corpus callosum (CC) is evident in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the correlation of microstructural damage in the CC on the cognitive performance of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD dementia is undetermined. We enrolled 26 normal controls, 24 patients with AD dementia, and 40 single-domain aMCI patients with at least grade 1 hippocampal atrophy and isolated memory impairment. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR) were measured. The entire CC was parcellated based on fiber trajectories to specific cortical Brodmann areas using a probabilistic tractography method. The relationship between the DTI measures in the subregions of the CC and cognitive performance was examined. Although the callosal degeneration in the patients with aMCI was less extended than in the patients with AD dementia, degeneration was already exhibited in several subregions of the CC at the aMCI stage. Scores of various neuropsychological tests were correlated to the severity of microstructural changes in the subregional CC connecting to functionally corresponding cortical regions. Our results confirm that CC degeneration is noticeable as early as the aMCI stage of AD and the disconnection of the CC subregional fibers to the corresponding Brodmann areas has an apparent impact on the related cognitive performance. 
24281842	Biomarker modelling of early molecular changes in Alzheimer's disease.
Mol Diagn Ther  2014Apr
The preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs years, possibly decades, before the onset of clinical symptoms. Being able to detect the very earliest stages of AD is critical to improving understanding of AD biology, and identifying individuals at greatest risk of developing clinical symptoms with a view to treating AD pathophysiology before irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. Studies of dominantly inherited AD families and longitudinal studies of sporadic AD have contributed to knowledge of the earliest AD biomarkers. Here we appraise this evidence before reviewing novel, particularly fluid, biomarkers that may provide insights into AD pathogenesis and relate these to existing hypothetical disease models.  
24608272	Analysis of neural dynamics in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease using wavelet turbulence.
J Neural Eng 20140310 2014Apr
Current diagnostic guidelines encourage further research for the development of novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, especially in its prodromal form (i.e. mild cognitive impairment, MCI). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can provide essential information about AD brain dynamics; however, only a few studies have addressed the characterization of MEG in incipient AD. We analyzed MEG rhythms from 36 AD patients, 18 MCI subjects and 27 controls, introducing a new wavelet-based parameter to quantify their dynamical properties: the wavelet turbulence. Our results suggest that AD progression elicits statistically significant regional-dependent patterns of abnormalities in the neural activity (p &lt; 0.05), including a progressive loss of irregularity, variability, symmetry and Gaussianity. Furthermore, the highest accuracies to discriminate AD and MCI subjects from controls were 79.4% and 68.9%, whereas, in the three-class setting, the accuracy reached 67.9%. Our findings provide an original description of several dynamical properties of neural activity in early AD and offer preliminary evidence that the proposed methodology is a promising tool for assessing brain changes at different stages of dementia. 
24694184	Abundance of AÎ²â‚…-x like immunoreactivity in transgenic 5XFAD, APP/PS1KI and 3xTG mice, sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease.
Mol Neurodegener 20140402 2014
According to the modified amyloid hypothesis the main event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of neurotoxic amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) within neurons. Additionally to full-length peptides, a great diversity of N-truncated AÎ² variants is derived from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). Vast evidence suggests that AÎ²xâ‚‹â‚„â‚‚ isoforms play an important role triggering neurodegeneration due to its high abundance, amyloidogenic propensity and toxicity. Although N-truncated and AÎ²xâ‚‹â‚„â‚‚ species have been pointed as crucial players in AD etiology, the AÎ²â‚…-x isoforms have not received much attention. The present study is the first to show immunohistochemical evidence of AÎ²â‚…-x in familial cases of AD (FAD) and its distribution in APP/PS1KI, 5XFAD and 3xTG transgenic mouse models. In order to probe AÎ²â‚…-x peptides we generated the AB5-3 antibody. Positive plaques and congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA) were observed among all the FAD cases tested carrying either APP or presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations and most of the sporadic cases of AD (SAD). Different patterns of AÎ²5-x distribution were found in the mouse models carrying different combinations of autosomal mutations in the APP, PS1 and Tau genes. All of them showed extracellular AÎ² deposits but none CAA. Additionally, they were all affected by a severe amyloid pathology in the hippocampus among other areas. Interestingly, neither 5XFAD nor APP/PS1KI showed any evidence for intraneuronal AÎ²â‚…-x. Different degrees of AÎ²â‚…-x accumulations can be found in the transgenic AD mouse models and human cases expressing the sporadic or the familial form of the disease. Due to the lack of intracellular AÎ²â‚…-x, these isoforms might not be contributing to early mechanisms in the cascade of events triggering AD pathology. Brain sections obtained from SAD cases showed higher AÎ²â‚…-x-immunoreactivity in vascular deposits than in extracellular plaques, while both are equally important in the FAD cases. The difference may rely on alternative mechanisms involving AÎ²â‚…-x peptides and operating in a divergent way in the late and early onset forms of the disease. 
24571847	[Comparative quality measurements part 3: funnel plots].
Pflege  2014Feb
Comparative quality measurements between organisations or institutions are common. Quality measures need to be standardised and risk adjusted. Random error must also be taken adequately into account. Rankings without consideration of the precision lead to flawed interpretations and enhances "gaming". Application of confidence intervals is one possibility to take chance variation into account. Funnel plots are modified control charts based on Statistical Process Control (SPC) theory. The quality measures are plotted against their sample size. Warning and control limits that are 2 or 3 standard deviations from the center line are added. With increasing group size the precision increases and so the control limits are forming a funnel. Data points within the control limits are considered to show common cause variation; data points outside special cause variation without the focus of spurious rankings. Funnel plots offer data based information about how to evaluate institutional performance within quality management contexts.  
24600683	Electroanalytical and surface plasmon resonance sensors for detection of breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in cells and body fluids.
Analyst  2014Apr21
Cancer and neurological disorders are two leading causes of human death. Their early diagnoses will either greatly improve the survival rate or facilitate effective treatments or modalities. Detection of biomarkers in body fluids and some tissues (e.g., blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluids) is relatively non-invasive and provides useful chemical and biological information that is complementary to tomographic imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and X-ray computed tomography). Recent years have witnessed the contributions from and potential applications of bioanalytical methods for early detection of major diseases. In this review, we survey some recent developments of electroanalytical (as a representative label-based technique) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (as a representative label-free technique) biosensors for detection of biomarkers relevant to etiologies of breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While breast cancer is representative of cancers of complexity (multiple biomarkers, false positives from tomographic scans, and a need for more effective early diagnostic methods), AD is the most prevalent neurological disorder that is also linked to multiple biomarkers. Both electroanalytical and SPR-based sensors have attractive features of sensitivity, portability, obviation of large sample volumes, and capability of multiplexed detection. Various sensing protocols developed in the past five years are reviewed, demonstrating the feasibility of both techniques for diagnostic purposes. Problems inherent in these two techniques that must be overcome before being clinically viable are also discussed.  
24338740	Effect of flavonoids on learning, memory and neurocognitive performance: relevance and potential implications for Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
J. Sci. Food Agric. 20131212 2014Apr
Recent evidence has indicated that a group of plant-derived compounds known as flavonoids may exert particularly powerful actions on mammalian cognition and may reverse age-related declines in memory and learning. In addition, growing evidence is also suggestive that flavonoids may delay the development of Alzheimer's disease-like pathology, suggestive of potential dietary strategies in dementia. Although these low-molecular-weight phytochemicals are absorbed to only a limited degree, they have been found to counteract age-related cognitive declines possibly via their ability to interact with the cellular and molecular architecture of the brain responsible for memory. However, the majority of the research has been carried out at rather supraphysiological concentrations and only a few studies have investigated the neuromodulatory effects of physiologically attainable flavonoid concentrations. This review will summarize the evidence for the effects of flavonoids and their metabolites in age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Mechanisms of actions will be discussed and include those activating signalling pathways critical in controlling synaptic plasticity, reducing neuroinflammation and inducing vascular effects potentially capable of causing new nerve cell growth in the hippocampus. Altogether, these processes are known to be important in maintaining optimal neuronal function, to limit neurodegeneration and to prevent or reverse age-dependent deteriorations in cognitive performance. 
24646308	In vitro acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity and the antioxidant properties of Aegle marmelos leaf extract: implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Psychogeriatrics  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by loss of memory and cognition. The effective therapeutic options for AD are limited and thus there is a demand for new drugs. Aegle marmelos (Linn.) (A.â€‰marmelos) leaves have been used in traditional medicine to promote intellect and enhance memory. In this study, we evaluated A.â€‰marmelos for its acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and antioxidant property in vitro in the treatment of AD. A crude methanol extract and four fractions (petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous) were prepared from the leaves of A.â€‰marmelos. The preparations were assessed for AChE inhibitory activity by the Ellman method, and their antioxidant properties were assessed by several assays: reducing power, scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical and hydroxyl radical, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of endogenous substances in A.â€‰marmelos were performed by the standard phytochemical methods. Among the different extracts tested, the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the highest inhibition of AChE activity. In the same way, ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest reducing activity and radical scavenging ability towards the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (half maximal inhibitory concentrationâ€‰=â€‰3.84â€‰Î¼g/mL) and hydroxyl free radicals (half maximal inhibitory concentrationâ€‰=â€‰5.68â€‰Î¼g/mL). The antiradical activity of the ethyl acetate fraction appeared to be similar to that of the reference standard butylated hydroxytoluene and catechin used in this study. In addition, the ethyl acetate fraction displayed higher inhibition of brain lipid peroxidation. Phytochemical screening of different extractives of A.â€‰marmelos showed the presence of phenols and flavonoids, alkaloid, saponin, glycoside, tannin and steroids. Quantitative analysis revealed higher contents of phenolics (58.79-mgâ€‰gallic acid equivalent/gâ€‰dried extract) and flavonoids (375.73-mgâ€‰gallic acid equivalent/gâ€‰dried extract) in the ethyl acetate fraction. The results suggest that the ethyl acetate fraction of A.â€‰marmelos is a significant source of polyphenolic compounds with potential AChE inhibitory property and antioxidant activity and, thus, may be useful in the treatment of AD. 
24565814	The clinical utility of the auditory P300 latency subcomponent event-related potential in preclinical diagnosis of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Brain Cogn 20140222 2014Apr
The present meta-analysis investigated the clinical utility of the auditory P300 latency event-related potential in differentiating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and unaffected controls. Effect size estimates were computed from mean P300 latency measurements at midline electrodes between patients and unaffected controls using the random effects restricted maximum likelihood model. The effects of clinical and ERP/EEG methological variables were assessed in a moderator analysis. P300 latency was found to be significantly prolonged in patients with AD (and MCI) compared to unaffected controls. Shortened P300 latencies were observed when comparing patients with MCI to patients with AD. Clinically relevant differences in P300 latency effect sizes were associated with mean age, interstimulus interval, stimulus difference, target frequency, reference electrode, and sampling rate. The meta-analytic findings provide robust statistical evidence for the use of the auditory P300 latency subcomponent as a biological marker of prodromal AD.  
24583352	Homoisoflavonoids as potential imaging agents for Î²-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140211 2014Apr9
A series of homoisoflavonoids [(E)-3-benzylidenechroman-4-ones, 3a-l] as novel potential diagnostic imaging agents targeting Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) were synthesized and evaluated. In vitro binding studies using AÎ²â‚?â‚‹â‚„â‚€ aggregates with [(125)I]IMPY as the reference ligand showed that these compounds demonstrated high to low binding affinities at the K(i) values ranged from 9.10 to 432.03 nM, depending on the substitution of the phenyl ring. Fluorescent staining in vitro indicated that one compound with a N,N-dimethylamino group intensely stained AÎ² plaques within brain sections of postmortem AD patients. Biodistribution studies in normal mice after i.v. injection of the radioiodinated homoisoflavonoid displayed good initial brain uptake (2.61% ID/g at 2 min postinjection) and rapid clearance from the brain (0.18% ID/g at 60 min), which is desirable for amyloid imaging agents. The results strongly suggest that these derivatives are worthy of further study and may be useful amyloid imaging agents for early detection of amyloid plaques in the brain of AD. 
24589487	Design, synthesis and evaluation of genistein-O-alkylbenzylamines as potential multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140217 2014Apr9
A series of genistein derivatives with carbon spacer-linked alkylbenzylamines were designed, synthesized and tested as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, with moderate-to-good anti-oxidative activity. Specifically, compounds 10b, 19d and 25d exhibited significant inhibition of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) aggregation and exhibited metal chelating properties. In particular, 25d inhibited: self-induced AÎ²â‚?â‚‹â‚„â‚‚ aggregation, Cu(2+)-induced AÎ²â‚?â‚‹â‚„â‚‚ aggregation, and human AChE-induced AÎ²â‚?â‚‹â‚„â‚€ aggregation by 35%, 77.8%, and 36.2%, respectively. Moreover, both kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition and the molecular modeling study suggested that 25d binds simultaneously to catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. More importantly, compound 25d disassembled the well-structured AÎ² fibrils generated by Cu(2+)-induced AÎ² aggregation by 72.1%. Furthermore, the step-down passive avoidance test showed this compound significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. These results suggest that 25d may be a promising multifunctional agent for AD treatment. 
24594525	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of D-ring opened galantamine analogs as multifunctional anti-Alzheimer agents.
Eur J Med Chem 20140214 2014Apr9
Facing the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, twelve dibenzofuran/carbazole derivatives, which can be considered as the D-ring opened analogs of galantamine, have been designed and synthesized as multifunctional anti-Alzheimer agents. In vitro tests revealed that compounds 3 and 5, which bear a nitrate moiety in the molecule, showed a potent inhibition activity towards AChE and compound 3 showed a good AÎ²42 aggregation inhibitory activity. Moreover, 3 and 5 could also release a relative low concentration of NO in vitro and they did not show toxicity to neuronal cells, while exerted a neuroprotective effect against the AÎ²-induced toxicity. More importantly, compound 3 showed a significant spatial memory improving effect in vivo, and a good safety in the ex vivo toxicity study. 
24602793	Identification of human presequence protease (hPreP) agonists for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140218 2014Apr9
Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), a neurotoxic peptide, is linked to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased AÎ² content within neuronal cell mitochondria is a pathological feature in both human and mouse models with AD. This accumulation of AÎ² within the mitochondrial landscape perpetuates increased free radical production and activation of the apoptotic pathway. Human Presequence Protease (hPreP) is responsible for the degradation of mitochondrial amyloid-Î² peptide in human neuronal cells, and is thus an attractive target to increase the proteolysis of AÎ². Therefore, it offers a potential target for Alzheimer's drug design, by identifying potential activators of hPreP. We applied structure-based drug design, combined with experimental methodologies to investigate the ability of various compounds to enhance hPreP proteolytic activity. Compounds 3c &amp;4c enhanced hPreP-mediated proteolysis of AÎ² (1-42), pFâ‚?Î² (2-54) and fluorogenic-substrate V. These results suggest that activation of hPreP by small benzimidazole derivatives provide a promising avenue for AD treatment. 
24201835	Polymorphisms in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and dopamine Î² hydroxylase genes are not associated with Alzheimer's disease.
J Neural Transm 20131108 2014Apr
Since ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde, are directly neurotoxic, alcohol intake could affect the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) metabolizes acetaldehyde into acetate and also protects against oxidative stress, playing an important role in the development of AD. The activity of dopamine Î² hydroxylase (DBH) is reduced in the hippocampus and neocortex in the AD brain. DBH is also involved in the pathophysiology of alcoholism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms of both ALDH2 and DBH genes were associated with AD. ALDH2*2 and two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DBH gene were analyzed using a case-control study design. Our case-control data set consisted of 201 AD patients and 130 age-matched controls. We also analyzed stratifying by alcohol consumption and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes. There were no associations between the SNPs studied here and the onset of AD. No synergetic associations were found among the SNPs, APOE and the risk for AD. Although high alcohol consumption AD (HAC-AD) patients were analyzed in detail, the current three SNPs were not related with HAC-AD. ALDH2*2 and functional SNPs of the DBH gene did not modify the risk for AD. Since our data set was constructed only with AD in a Japanese population, further detailed genetic analyses with other ethnic groups would be needed.  
24253237	Plasma BDNF levels are correlated with aggressiveness in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease.
J Neural Transm 20131120 2014Apr
In the present study, we examined whether neuropsychiatric symptoms were correlated with plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels as a state marker or were associated with the BDNF polymorphism Val66Met in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (A-MCI) or Alzheimer disease (AD). One hundred and seventy-six outpatients with AD (nÂ =Â 129) or A-MCI (nÂ =Â 47) were selected and their plasma BDNF concentrations measured. Next, we investigated the correlation between the plasma BDNF level and the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer Disease (Behave-AD) subscale scores, which reflect neuropsychiatric symptoms. We also compared the plasma BDNF level and the Behave-AD subscale scores among the BDNF Val66Met genotypic groups. Among the seven Behave-AD subscale scores, aggressiveness was positively correlated with the plasma BDNF level (Ï?Â =Â 0.237, PÂ &lt;Â 0.005), but did not differ significantly among the three BDNF Val66Met genotypic groups. The Behave-AD total and other subscale scores did not differ significantly among the BDNF Val66Met genotypic groups and were not associated with the plasma BDNF level. Moreover, the plasma BDNF level did not differ significantly among the three BDNF Val66Met genotypic groups or between patients with A-MCI and those with AD. The plasma BDNF level was robustly correlated with aggressiveness, implying that the plasma BDNF level might be useful as a behavioral state marker in patients with AD or A-MCI.  
24765074	Electrostimulation to reduce synaptic scaling driven progression of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Comput Neurosci 20140403 2014
Cell death and synapse dysfunction are two likely causes of cognitive decline in AD. As cells die and synapses lose their drive, remaining cells suffer an initial decrease in activity. Neuronal homeostatic synaptic scaling then provides a feedback mechanism to restore activity. This homeostatic mechanism is believed to sense levels of activity-dependent cytosolic calcium within the cell and to adjust neuronal firing activity by increasing the density of AMPA synapses at remaining synapses to achieve balance. The scaling mechanism increases the firing rates of remaining cells in the network to compensate for decreases in network activity. However, this effect can itself become a pathology, as it produces increased imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits, leading to greater susceptibility to further cell loss via calcium-mediated excitotoxicity. Here, we present a mechanistic explanation of how directed brain stimulation might be expected to slow AD progression based on computational simulations in a 470-neuron biomimetic model of a neocortical column. The simulations demonstrate that the addition of low-intensity electrostimulation (neuroprosthesis) to a network undergoing AD-like cell death can raise global activity and break this homeostatic-excitotoxic cascade. The increase in activity within the remaining cells in the column results in lower scaling-driven AMPAR upregulation, reduced imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory circuits, and lower susceptibility to ongoing damage.  
24338474	Signature amyloid Î² profiles are produced by different Î³-secretase complexes.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131213 2014Feb14
Î³-Secretase complexes are involved in the generation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) in the brain. Therefore, Î³-secretase has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer disease (AD). Targeting Î³-secretase activity in AD requires the pharmacological dissociation of the processing of physiological relevant substrates and the generation of "toxic" AÎ². Previous reports suggest the differential targeting of Î³-secretase complexes, based on their subunit composition, as a valid strategy. However, little is known about the biochemical properties of the different complexes, and key questions regarding their AÎ² product profiles should be first addressed. Here, we expressed, purified, and analyzed, under the same conditions, the endopeptidase and carboxypeptidase-like activities of the four Î³-secretase complexes present in humans. We find that the nature of the catalytic subunit in the complex affects both activities. Interestingly, PSEN2 complexes discriminate between the AÎ²40 and AÎ²38 production lines, indicating that AÎ² generation in one or the other pathway can be dissociated. In contrast, the APH1 subunit mainly affects the carboxypeptidase-like activity, with APH1B complexes favoring the generation of longer AÎ² peptides. In addition, we determined that expression of a single human Î³-secretase complex in cell lines retains the intrinsic attributes of the protease while present in the membrane, providing validation for the in vitro studies. In conclusion, our data show that each Î³-secretase complex produces a characteristic AÎ² signature. The qualitative and quantitative differences between different Î³-secretase complexes could be used to advance drug development in AD and other disorders.  
24366862	Analysis of the hippocampal proteome in ME7 prion disease reveals a predominant astrocytic signature and highlights the brain-restricted production of clusterin in chronic neurodegeneration.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131223 2014Feb14
Prion diseases are characterized by accumulation of misfolded protein, gliosis, synaptic dysfunction, and ultimately neuronal loss. This sequence, mirroring key features of Alzheimer disease, is modeled well in ME7 prion disease. We used iTRAQ(TM)/mass spectrometry to compare the hippocampal proteome in control and late-stage ME7 animals. The observed changes associated with reactive glia highlighted some specific proteins that dominate the proteome in late-stage disease. Four of the up-regulated proteins (GFAP, high affinity glutamate transporter (EAAT-2), apo-J (Clusterin), and peroxiredoxin-6) are selectively expressed in astrocytes, but astrocyte proliferation does not contribute to their up-regulation. The known functional role of these proteins suggests this response acts against protein misfolding, excitotoxicity, and neurotoxic reactive oxygen species. A recent convergence of genome-wide association studies and the peripheral measurement of circulating levels of acute phase proteins have focused attention on Clusterin as a modifier of late-stage Alzheimer disease and a biomarker for advanced neurodegeneration. Since ME7 animals allow independent measurement of acute phase proteins in the brain and circulation, we extended our investigation to address whether changes in the brain proteome are detectable in blood. We found no difference in the circulating levels of Clusterin in late-stage prion disease when animals will show behavioral decline, accumulation of misfolded protein, and dramatic synaptic and neuronal loss. This does not preclude an important role of Clusterin in late-stage disease, but it cautions against the assumption that brain levels provide a surrogate peripheral measure for the progression of brain degeneration.  
24404822	Psychometric properties of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): an analysis using the Rasch model.
Clin Neuropsychol 20140110 2014
In the present study we analyzed the psychometric characteristics of the MoCA (Portuguese version) using the Rasch model for dichotomous items. The total sample comprised of 897 participants distributed between two main subgroups: (I) healthy group that was comprised of 650 cognitively healthy community dwellers and (II) clinical group that was comprised of 90 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 33 patients with frontotemporal dementia, and 34 patients with vascular dementia recruited at a reference dementia clinic. All patients were investigated through a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, laboratory tests essential to exclude a reversible form of dementia, imaging studies (CT or MRI and SPECT or FDG-PET), Apolipoprotein E allele genotyping and CSF biomarker (AÎ²42,Tau, and P-tau) analyses. The clinical diagnosis was established through the consensus of a multidisciplinary team, based on international criteria. The results demonstrated an overall good fit of both items and the person's values, a high variability on cognitive performance level, and a good quality of the measurements. The MoCA scores also demonstrated adequate discriminant validity, with high diagnostic value. DIF analyses indicated the generalized validity of the MoCA scores. In conclusion, the results of this study show the overall psychometric adequacy of the MoCA and verify the discriminant and generalized validity of the obtained results.  
24512768	Rutin improves spatial memory in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice by reducing AÎ² oligomer level and attenuating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.
Behav. Brain Res. 20140207 2014May1
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. AÎ² aggregation is closely associated with neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuronal inflammation. The soluble AÎ² oligomers are believed to be the most neurotoxic form among all forms of AÎ² aggregates. We have previously reported a polyphenol compound rutin that could inhibit AÎ² aggregation and cytotoxicity, attenuate oxidative stress, and decrease the production of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines in vitro. In the current study, we investigated the effect of rutin on APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. Results demonstrated that orally administered rutin significantly attenuated memory deficits in AD transgenic mice, decreased oligomeric AÎ² level, increased super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio, reduced GSSG and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, downregulated microgliosis and astrocytosis, and decreased interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-6 levels in the brain. These results indicated that rutin is a promising agent for AD treatment because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and reducing AÎ² oligomer activities. 
23736883	Vagus somatosensory evoked potentials are delayed in Alzheimer's disease, but not in major depression.
Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 20130605 2014Apr
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the degeneration of brainstem nuclei is different from major depression (MD). Thus, vagus somatosensory evoked potentials (VSEP) proposed for the functional assessment of brainstem nuclei should show prolonged latencies in AD but not in MD. In 55 AD patients, 57 MD patients and two age-matched control groups evoked potentials were recorded upon stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. In the AD, not in the MD group, latencies were significantly longer as compared to controls. Thus, the method of VSEP could contribute to the important differential diagnosis of AD and MD in elderly patients.  
24580505	Registering eye movements during reading in Alzheimer's disease: difficulties in predicting upcoming words.
J Clin Exp Neuropsychol 20140228 2014Apr
Reading requires the fine integration of attention, ocular movements, word identification, and language comprehension, among other cognitive parameters. Several of the associated cognitive processes such as working memory and semantic memory are known to be impaired by Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study analyzes eye movement behavior of 18 patients with probable AD and 40 age-matched controls during Spanish sentence reading. Controls focused mainly on word properties and considered syntactic and semantic structures. At the same time, controls' knowledge and prediction about sentence meaning and grammatical structure are quite evident when we consider some aspects of visual exploration, such as word skipping, and forward saccades. By contrast, in the AD group, the predictability effect of the upcoming word was absent, visual exploration was less focused, fixations were much longer, and outgoing saccade amplitudes were smaller than those in controls. The altered visual exploration and the absence of a contextual predictability effect might be related to impairments in working memory and long-term memory retrieval functions. These eye movement measures demonstrate considerable sensitivity with respect to evaluating cognitive processes in Alzheimer's disease. They could provide a user-friendly marker of early disease symptoms and of its posterior progression.  
24637718	A novel approach of groupwise fMRI-guided tractography allowing to characterize the clinical evolution of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140317 2014
Guiding diffusion tract-based anatomy by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we aim to investigate the relationship between structural connectivity and functional activity in the human brain. To this purpose, we introduced a novel groupwise fMRI-guided tractographic approach, that was applied on a population ranging between prodromic and moderate stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study comprised of 15 subjects affected by amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 14 diagnosed with AD and 14 elderly healthy adults who were used as controls. By creating representative (ensemble) functionally guided tracts within each group of participants, our methodology highlighted the white matter fiber connections involved in verbal fluency functions for a specific population, and hypothesized on brain compensation mechanisms that potentially counteract or reduce cognitive impairment symptoms in prodromic AD. Our hope is that this fMRI-guided tractographic approach could have potential impact in various clinical studies, while investigating white/gray matter connectivity, in both health and disease.  
23900307	Biochanin-A ameliorates behavioural and neurochemical derangements in cognitive-deficit mice for the betterment of Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Exp Toxicol 20130730 2014Apr
Biochanin-A (BCA), a potent phytoconstituent, has been previously used as an antitumour, a dopaminergic neuron protective agent, an antioxidant, an anticholinergic and on other pharmacological activities including neuroprotection. The present study was aimed to evaluate the behavioural and neurochemical evidence of BCA in cognitive-deficit mice in scopolamine challenged and natural aged-induced amnesia models in young and aged mice, respectively. BCA has exhibited decrease in the transfer latency and increase in step through latency significantly (p &lt; 0.001) in scopolamine-treated and natural aged mice of exteroceptive behavioural models such as elevated plus maze and passive shock avoidance paradigm, respectively. A decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity of whole brain was seen in scopolamine and aged mice with standard piracetam (Pira; p &lt; 0.001) and BCA in dose-dependent manner. The antioxidant property of BCA was proven by increase in GSH (p &lt; 0.01) and decrease in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level significantly in a scopolamine-challenged and aged mice. The scopolamine-treated mice exhibited significant (p &lt; 0.01) increase in the content of noradrenalin and dopamine, which is a sign of dementia, and these excess increased neurotransmitters were reversed by BCA 40 mg kg(-1) (p &lt; 0.05), BCA 20 mg kg(-1) (p &gt; 0.05), BCA 10 mg kg(-1) (p &lt; 0.05) and standard Pira (p &lt; 0.05) when compared with scopolamine group. Furthermore, in histopathology of hippocampus, the Pira and BCA-treated mice were protected from the formation of pyknotic neurons, increases in the viable cells count and decreases in the number of degenerative cells compared with the scopolamine group. Hence, BCA could be potential enough for the betterment of Alzheimer's disease.  
24360504	Aging, cortical injury and Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in the guinea pig brain.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131127 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized histopathologically by the abnormal deposition of the proteins amyloid-beta (AÎ²) and tau. A major issue for AD research is the lack of an animal model that accurately replicates the human disease, thus making it difficult to investigate potential risk factors for AD such as head injury. Furthermore, as age remains the strongest risk factor for most of the AD cases, transgenic models in which mutant human genes are expressed throughout the life span of the animal provide only limited insight into age-related factors in disease development. Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) are of interest in AD research because they have a similar AÎ² sequence to humans and thus may present a useful non-transgenic animal model of AD. Brains from guinea pigs aged 3-48 months were examined to determine the presence of age-associated AD-like pathology. In addition, fluid percussion-induced brain injury was performed to characterize mechanisms underlying the association between AD risk and head injury. No statistically significant changes were detected in the overall response to aging, although we did observe some region-specific changes. Diffuse deposits of AÎ² were found in the hippocampal region of the oldest animals and alterations in amyloid precursor protein processing and tau immunoreactivity were observed with age. Brain injury resulted in a strong and sustained increase in amyloid precursor protein and tau immunoreactivity without AÎ² deposition, over 7 days. Guinea pigs may therefore provide a useful model for investigating the influence of environmental and non-genetic risk factors on the pathogenesis of AD. 
24368087	The role of synaptic activity in the regulation of amyloid beta levels in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131128 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) peptides is regarded as the critical component associated with AD pathogenesis, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. Recent studies suggest that synaptic activity is one of the most important factors that regulate AÎ² levels. It has been found that synaptic activity facilitates APP internalization and influences APP cleavage. Glutamatergic, cholinergic, serotonergic, leptin, adrenergic, orexin, and gamma-amino butyric acid receptors, as well as the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) are all involved in these processes. The present review summarizes the evidence for synaptic activity-modulated AÎ² levels and the mechanisms underlying this regulation. Interestingly, the immediate early gene product Arc may also be the downstream signaling molecule of several receptors in the synaptic activity-modulated AÎ² levels. Elucidating how AÎ² levels are regulated by synaptic activity may provide new insights in both the understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and in the development of therapies to slow down the progression of AD.  
24378087	Investigation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 variant in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131120 2014Jun
Recent studies have found an association between a variant in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) (rs75932628-T) and both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive function in individuals aged 80-100 years. The role of TREM2 in younger, asymptomatic individuals is unknown. We examined this variant in 1148 participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, a longitudinal study of middle-aged adults enriched for a parental history of AD. Thirteen individuals carried the T risk allele. Carriers were more likely to have a parental history of AD (100% of carriers vs. 70% of noncarriers; p = 0.01) and, among the parental history subset, families with a TREM2 carrier had a younger maternal age of AD onset than noncarriers (67.9 vs. 75.6 years; p = 0.03). There was no significant association between TREM2 carrier status and cognitive function or decline. In conclusion, the association between TREM2 and both parental history of AD and younger maternal age of AD onset provide additional support for the role of TREM2 in AD and illustrate the importance of considering family history in AD study design. 
24387984	Global changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in Alzheimer's disease human brain.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131204 2014Jun
DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine [5mC]) is one of several epigenetic markers altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. More recently, attention has been given to DNA hydroxymethylation (5-hydroxymethylcytosine [5hmC]), the oxidized form of 5mC. Whereas 5mC is generally associated with the inhibition of gene expression, 5hmC has been associated with increased gene expression and is involved in cellular processes such as differentiation, development, and aging. Recent findings point toward a role for 5hmC in the development of diseases including AD, potentially opening new pathways for treating AD through correcting methylation and hydroxymethylation alterations. In the present study, levels of 5mC and 5hmC were investigated in the human middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and middle temporal gyrus (MTG) by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for 5mC and 5hmC were significantly increased in AD MFG (N = 13) and MTG (N = 29) compared with age-matched controls (MFG, N = 13 and MTG, N = 29). Global levels of 5mC and 5hmC positively correlated with each other and with markers of AD including amyloid beta, tau, and ubiquitin loads. Our results showed a global hypermethylation in the AD brain and revealed that levels of 5hmC were also significantly increased in AD MFG and MTG with no apparent influence of gender, age, postmortem delay, or tissue storage time. Using double-fluorescent immunolabeling, we found that in control and AD brains, levels of 5mC and 5hmC were low in astrocytes and microglia but were elevated in neurons. In addition, our colocalization study showed that within the same nuclei, 5mC and 5hmC mostly do not coexist. The present study clearly demonstrates the involvement of 5mC and 5hmC in AD emphasizing the need for future studies determining the exact time frame of these epigenetic changes during the progression of AD pathology. 
24411482	Mammalian target of rapamycin hyperactivity mediates the detrimental effects of a high sucrose diet on Alzheimer's disease pathology.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131214 2014Jun
High sugar consumption and diabetes increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) by unknown mechanisms. Using an animal model of AD, here we show that high sucrose intake induces obesity with changes in central and peripheral insulin signaling. These pre-diabetic changes are associated with an increase in amyloid-Î² production and deposition. Moreover, high sucrose ingestion exacerbates tau phosphorylation by increasing Cdk5 activity. Mechanistically, the sucrose-mediated increase in AD-like pathology results from hyperactive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key nutrient sensor important in regulating energy homeostasis. Specifically, we show that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, prevents the detrimental effects of sucrose in the brain without altering changes in peripheral insulin resistance. Overall, our data suggest that high sucrose intake and dysregulated insulin signaling, which are known to contribute to the occurrence of diabetes, increase the risk of developing AD by upregulating brain mTOR signaling. Therefore, early interventions to modulate mTOR activity in individuals at high risk of developing diabetes may decrease their AD susceptibility.  
24439028	A search for age-related macular degeneration risk variants in Alzheimer disease genes and pathways.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131219 2014Jun
Several lines of inquiry point to overlapping molecular mechanisms between late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We evaluated summarized results from large genome-wide association studies for AD and AMD to test the hypothesis that AD susceptibility loci are also associated with AMD. We observed association of both disorders with genes in a region of chromosome 7, including PILRA and ZCWPW1 (peak AMD SNP rs7792525, minor allele frequency [MAF] = 19%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.14, p = 2.34 Ã— 10(-6)), and with ABCA7 (peak AMD SNP rs3752228, MAF = 0.054, OR = 1.22, p = 0.00012). Next, we evaluated association of AMD with genes in AD-related pathways identified by canonical pathway analysis of AD-associated genes. Significant associations were observed with multiple previously identified AMD risk loci and 2 novel genes: HGS (peak SNP rs8070488, MAF = 0.23, OR = 0.91, p = 7.52 Ã— 10(-5)), which plays a role in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling pathway, and TNF (peak SNP rs2071590, MAF = 0.34, OR = 0.89, p = 1.17 Ã— 10(-5)), which is a member of the atherosclerosis signaling and the LXR/RXR activation pathways. Our results suggest that AMD and AD share genetic mechanisms. 
24461366	Alterations of CaÂ²â?º-responsive proteins within cholinergic neurons in aging and Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131225 2014Jun
The molecular basis of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains poorly understood. Using basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) as a model and immunohistochemistry, we have demonstrated significant age-related loss of the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D(28K) (CB) from BFCN, which was associated with tangle formation and degeneration in AD. Here, we determined alterations in RNA and protein for CB and the Ca(2+)-responsive proteins Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI), growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43), and calpain in the BF. We observed progressive downregulation of CB and CaMKI RNA in laser-captured BFCN in the normal-aged-AD continuum. We also detected progressive loss of CB, CaMKIÎ´, and GAP43 proteins in BF homogenates in aging and AD. Activated Î¼-calpain, a calcium-sensitive protease that degrades CaMKI and GAP43, was significantly increased in the normal aged BF and was 10 times higher in AD BF. Overactivation of Î¼-calpain was confirmed using proteolytic fragments of its substrate spectrin. Substantial age- and AD-related alterations in Ca(2+)-sensing proteins most likely contribute to selective vulnerability of BFCN to degeneration in AD. 
24468471	Pinocembrin improves cognition and protects the neurovascular unit in Alzheimer related deficits.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131228 2014Jun
Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides accumulate in the brain and initiate a cascade of pathologic events in Alzheimer's disease. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been implicated to mediate AÎ²-induced perturbations in the neurovascular unit (NVU). We demonstrated that pinocembrin exhibits neuroprotection through inhibition of the AÎ² and/or RAGE pathway, but the therapeutic role and mechanism involved are not ascertained. Here, we report that a 3-month treatment with pinocembrin prevents the cognition decline in APP/PS1 transgenic mice without altering AÎ² burden and oxidative stress. Instead, pinocembrin is effective in conferring neurovascular protection through maintenance of neuropil ultrastructure, reduction of glial activation and levels of inflammatory mediators, preservation of microvascular function, improving the cholinergic system by conserving the ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway, and modulation of RAGE-mediated transduction. Furthermore, in an in vitro model, pinocembrin provides the NVU protection against fibrillar AÎ²â‚?â‚‹â‚„â‚‚, accompanied by regulation of neurovascular RAGE pathways. Our findings indicate that pinocembrin improves cognition, at least in part, attributable to the NVU protection, and highlights pinocembrin as a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
24468472	Association between the CETP polymorphisms and the risk of Alzheimer's disease, carotid atherosclerosis, longevity, and the efficacy of statin therapy.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140103 2014Jun
The purpose of this meta-analysis was to detect the association between the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene polymorphisms and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), carotid atherosclerosis, longevity, and the efficacy of statin therapy. Databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, the Cochrane Library, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were systematically searched. Thirty-two studies were included in this meta-analysis. There was no difference in the I405V, C629A, and Taq1B polymorphisms between AD and control groups. However, stratified analysis showed that AD group had higher B2B2 genotype frequency than control group in Asian populations with APOE4+ in Taq1B. I405V and Taq1B polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of carotid atherosclerosis and longevity. The efficacy of statin therapy was not associated with Taq1B polymorphism. In conclusion, there was no association between cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene polymorphisms and the risk of AD, carotid atherosclerosis, longevity, and the efficacy of statin therapy in the pooled effects of overall population. However, the B2B2 genotype of Taq1B was associated with increased risk of AD in the Asian populations with APOE4+.  
24485507	Base excision DNA repair levels in mitochondrial lysates of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20140108 2014Jun
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a senile dementia with increased incidence in older subjects (age &gt;65 years). One of the earliest markers of AD is oxidative DNA damage. Recently, it has been reported that preclinical AD patient brains show elevated levels of oxidative damage in both nuclear and mitochondrial nucleic acids. Moreover, different oxidative lesions in mitochondrial DNA are between 5- and 10-fold higher than in nuclear DNA in both control and AD postmortem brains. We previously showed that there is a significant loss of base excision repair (BER) components in whole tissue extracts of AD and mild cognitive impairment subjects relative to matched control subjects. However, comprehensive analysis of specific steps in BER levels in mitochondrial extracts of AD patient brains is not available. In this study, we mainly investigated various components of BER in mitochondrial extracts of AD and matched control postmortem brain samples. We found that the 5-hydroxyuracil incision and ligase activities are significantly lower in AD brains, whereas the uracil incision, abasic site cleavage, and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate incorporation activities are normal in these samples.  
24640977	Brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease and its potential treatment with GLP-1 analogs.
Neurodegener Dis Manag  2014Feb
The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is increasing rapidly in the absence of truly effective therapies. A promising strategy for developing such therapies is the treatment of brain insulin resistance, a common and early feature of Alzheimer's disease, closely tied to cognitive decline and capable of promoting many biological abnormalities in the disorder. The proximal cause of brain insulin resistance appears to be neuronal elevation in the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, most likely due to amyloid-Î²-triggered microglial release of proinflammatory cytokines. Preclinically, the first line of defense is behavior-lowering peripheral insulin resistance (e.g., physical exercise and a Mediterranean diet supplemented with foods rich in flavonoids, curcumin and Ï‰-3 fatty acids). More potent remediation is required, however, at clinical stages. Fortunately, the US FDA-approved antidiabetics exenatide (Byetta; Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CA, USA) and liraglutide (Victoza; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) are showing much promise in reducing Alzheimer's disease pathology and in restoring normal brain insulin responsiveness and cognitive function. 
24640981	Advances in imaging-genetic relationships for Alzheimer's disease: clinical implications.
Neurodegener Dis Manag  2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and represents a major public health problem. From a clinical perspective, AD is devastating to patients and their families. The genetic approach to the study of dementia undoubtedly continues to provide a significant contribution to understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapeutic perspectives, but also raises important ethical implications. With advances in new technology, including genetics and PET/MRI scanning, the role of genetic studies and neuroimaging is being redefined as an aid in the clinical diagnosis of AD, and also in presymptomatic evaluation. Here, we review some of the issues related to the neuroimaging-genetic relationship in AD with a possible clinical implication as a preclinical biomarker for dementia and also for tracking disease progression. 
24051356	Evaluation of group-specific, whole-brain atlas generation using Volume-based Template Estimation (VTE): application to normal and Alzheimer's populations.
Neuroimage 20130916 2014Jan1
MRI-based human brain atlases, which serve as a common coordinate system for image analysis, play an increasingly important role in our understanding of brain anatomy, image registration, and segmentation. Study-specific brain atlases are often obtained from one of the subjects in a study or by averaging the images of all participants after linear or non-linear registration. The latter approach has the advantage of providing an unbiased anatomical representation of the study population. But, the image contrast is influenced by both inherent MR contrasts and residual anatomical variability after the registration; in addition, the topology of the brain structures cannot reliably be preserved. In this study, we demonstrated a population-based template-creation approach, which is based on Bayesian template estimation on a diffeomorphic random orbit model. This approach attempts to define a population-representative template without the cross-subject intensity averaging; thus, the topology of the brain structures is preserved. It has been tested for segmented brain structures, such as the hippocampus, but its validity on whole-brain MR images has not been examined. This paper validates and evaluates this atlas generation approach, i.e., Volume-based Template Estimation (VTE). Using datasets from normal subjects and Alzheimer's patients, quantitative measurements of sub-cortical structural volumes, metric distance, displacement vector, and Jacobian were examined to validate the group-averaged shape features of the VTE. In addition to the volume-based quantitative analysis, the preserved brain topology of the VTE allows surface-based analysis within the same atlas framework. This property was demonstrated by analyzing the registration accuracy of the pre- and post-central gyri. The proposed method achieved registration accuracy within 1mm for these population-preserved cortical structures in an elderly population.  
24424093	Amyloid Î² binds procaspase-9 to inhibit assembly of Apaf-1 apoptosome and intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20140112 2014Apr
Apoptosis is essential in the death process induced by Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), a major constituent of diffuse plaques found in Alzheimer's disease patients. However, we have found that caspase activation and cell death induced by staurosporine, employed to induce the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, were significantly reduced by 42 amino-acid AÎ²42, implying that the peptide also has a negative effect on the apoptotic process. The inhibitory effect of AÎ²42 on the apoptotic pathway is associated with its interaction with procaspase-9 and consequent inhibition of Apaf-1 apoptosome assembly. We detected the inhibitory effect in the early stage (&lt;8h) of apoptosis, but later caspase activation becomes obvious. Thus we inferred that the inhibitory process on apoptosis begins at an early stage, and the later robust activation surpasses it. We propose that the apoptotic manifestation in AÎ²-treated cells is a combined consequence of those anti- and pro-apoptotic processes.  
24368770	Rheb GTPase regulates Î²-secretase levels and amyloid Î² generation.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131224 2014Feb28
The Î²-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (Î²-secretase, BACE1) initiates amyloidogenic processing of APP to generate amyloid Î² (AÎ²), which is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Cerebral levels of BACE1 are elevated in individuals with AD, but the molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. We demonstrate that Rheb GTPase (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which induces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, is a physiological regulator of BACE1 stability and activity. Rheb overexpression depletes BACE1 protein levels and reduces AÎ² generation, whereas the RNAi knockdown of endogenous Rheb promotes BACE1 accumulation, and this effect by Rheb is independent of its mTOR signaling. Moreover, GTP-bound Rheb interacts with BACE1 and degrades it through proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that Rheb levels are down-regulated in the AD brain, which is consistent with an increased BACE1 expression. Altogether, our study defines Rheb as a novel physiological regulator of BACE1 levels and AÎ² generation, and the Rheb-BACE1 circuitry may have a role in brain biology and disease.  
23890735	Genetics of Alzheimer's disease in Caribbean Hispanic and African American populations.
Biol. Psychiatry 20130725 2014Apr1
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), which is characterized by progressive deterioration in cognition, function, and behavior, is the most common cause of dementia and the sixth leading cause of all deaths, placing a considerable burden on Western societies. Most studies aiming to identify genetic susceptibility factors for LOAD have focused on non-Hispanic white populations. This is, in part related to differences in linkage disequilibrium and allele frequencies between ethnic groups that could lead to confounding. However, in addition, non-Hispanic white populations are simply more widely studied. As a consequence, minorities are genetically underrepresented despite the fact that in several minority populations living in the same community as whites (including African American and Caribbean Hispanics), LOAD incidence is higher. This review summarizes the current knowledge on genetic risk factors associated with LOAD risk in Caribbean Hispanics and African Americans and provides suggestions for future research. We focus on Caribbean Hispanics and African Americans because they have a high LOAD incidence and a body of genetic studies on LOAD that is based on samples with genome-wide association studies data and reasonably large effect sizes to yield generalizable results.  
24012326	Progress update: fluid and imaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.
Biol. Psychiatry 20130905 2014Apr1
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing health crisis around the world. Although significant progress has been made in our understanding of AD pathogenesis, there is currently no effective treatment to delay onset or prevent the disease. The focus has now shifted to the identification and treatment of AD in the early clinical stages as well as before cognitive symptoms emerge-during the long preclinical stage. It is possible that diagnosis of individuals with AD will be more accurate when clinical symptoms and signs are combined with biomarkers, which can improve both the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of AD and its differentiation from the other neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses fluid and imaging biomarkers that have shown promise in such areas, as well as some of the current challenges that face the field.  
24559299	Evidence of redox-active iron formation following aggregation of ferrihydrite and the Alzheimer's disease peptide Î²-amyloid.
Inorg Chem 20140221 2014Mar17
Recent work has demonstrated increased levels of redox-active iron biominerals in Alzheimer's disease (AD) tissue. However, the origin, nature, and role of iron in AD pathology remains unclear. Using X-ray absorption, X-ray microspectroscopy, and electron microscopy techniques, we examined interactions between the AD peptide Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) and ferrihydrite, which is the ferric form taken when iron is stored in humans. We report that AÎ² is capable of reducing ferrihydrite to a pure iron(II) mineral where antiferromagnetically ordered Fe(2+) cations occupy two nonequivalent crystal symmetry sites. Examination of these iron(II) phases following air exposure revealed a material consistent with the iron(II)-rich mineral magnetite. These results demonstrate the capability of AÎ² to induce the redox-active biominerals reported in AD tissue from natural iron precursors. Such interactions between AÎ² and ferrihydrite shed light upon the processes of AD pathogenesis, while providing potential targets for future therapies.  
23846344	Consumer preferences for the predictive genetic test for Alzheimer disease.
J Genet Couns 20130712 2014Apr
The purpose of this study was to assess consumer preferences for predictive genetic testing for Alzheimer disease in the United States. A rating conjoint analysis was conducted using an anonymous online survey distributed by Qualtrics to a general population panel in April 2011 in the United States. The study design included three attributes: Accuracy (40%, 80%, and 100%), Treatment Availability (Cure is available/Drug for symptom relief but no cure), and Anonymity (Anonymous/Not anonymous). A total of 12 scenarios were used to elicit people's preference, assessed by an 11-point scale. The respondents also indicated their highest willingness-to-pay (WTP) for each scenario through open-ended questions. A total of 295 responses were collected over 4 days. The most important attribute for the aggregate model was Accuracy, contributing 64.73% to the preference rating. Treatment Availability and Anonymity contributed 20.72% and 14.59%, respectively, to the preference rating. The median WTP for the highest-rating scenario (Accuracy 100%, a cure is available, test result is anonymous) was $100 (meanâ€‰=â€‰$276). The median WTP for the lowest-rating scenario (40% accuracy, no cure but drugs for symptom relief, not anonymous) was zero (meanâ€‰=â€‰$34). The results of this study highlight attributes people find important when making the hypothetical decision to obtain an AD genetic test. These results should be of interests to policy makers, genetic test developers and health care providers. 
24362083	Genetic mouse models of brain ageing and Alzheimer's disease.
Pharmacol. Ther. 20131219 2014May
Progression of brain ageing is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Analysis of genetically modified animals with uniform genetic backgrounds in a standardised, controlled environment enables the dissection of critical determinants of brain ageing on a molecular level. Human and animal studies suggest that increased load of damaged macromolecules, efficacy of DNA maintenance, mitochondrial activity, and cellular stress defences are critical determinants of brain ageing. Surprisingly, mouse lines with genetic impairment of anti-oxidative capacity generally did not show enhanced cognitive ageing but rather an increased sensitivity to oxidative challenge. Mouse lines with impaired mitochondrial activity had critically short life spans or severe and rapidly progressing neurodegeneration. Strains with impaired clearance in damaged macromolecules or defects in the regulation of cellular stress defences showed alterations in the onset and progression of cognitive decline. Importantly, reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling generally increased life span but impaired cognitive functions revealing a complex interaction between ageing of the brain and of the body. Brain ageing is accompanied by an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Transgenic mouse models expressing high levels of mutant human amyloid precursor protein showed a number of symptoms and pathophysiological processes typical for early phase of Alzheimer's disease. Generally, therapeutic strategies effective against Alzheimer's disease in humans were also active in the Tg2576, APP23, APP/PS1 and 5xFAD lines, but a large number of false positive findings were also reported. The 3xtg AD model likely has the highest face and construct validity but further studies are needed.  
24602248	X chromosome aneuploidy in the Alzheimer's disease brain.
Mol Cytogenet 20140306 2014
Although the link between brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a matter of debate, processes hallmarking cellular and tissue senescence have been repeatedly associated with its pathogenesis. Here, we have studied X chromosome aneuploidy (a recognized feature of aged cell populations) in the AD brain. Extended molecular neurocytogenetic analyses of X chromosome aneuploidy in 10 female AD as well as 10 age and sex matched female control postmortem brain samples was performed by multiprobe/quantitative FISH. Additionally, aneuploidy rate in the brain samples of 5Â AD and as 5 age and sex matched control subjects were analyzed by interphase chromosome-specific multicolor banding (ICS-MCB). Totally, 182,500 cells in the AD brain and 182,500 cells in the unaffected brain were analyzed. The mean rate of X chromosome aneuploidy in AD samples was approximately two times higher than in control (control: mean - 1.32%, 95% CI 0.92- 1.71%; AD: mean - 2.79%, 95% CI 1.88-3.69; P = 0.013). One AD sample demonstrated mosaic aneuploidy of chromosome X confined to the hippocampus affecting about 10% of cells. ICS-MCB confirmed the presence of X chromosome aneuploidy in the hippocampal tissues of AD brain (control: mean - 1.74%, 95% CI 1.38- 2.10%; AD: mean - 4.92%, 95% CI 1.14-8.71; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Addressing X chromosome number variation in the brain, we observed that somatically acquired (post-zygotic) aneuploidy causes large-scale genomic alterations in neural cells of AD patients and, therefore, can be involved in pathogenesis of this common neurodegenerative disorder. In the context of debates about possible interplay between brain aging and AD neurodegeneration, our findings suggest that X chromosome aneuploidy can contribute to both processes. To this end we conclude that mosaic aneuploidy in the brain is a new non-heritable genetic factor predisposing to AD. 
24754001	Identification of microRNAs involved in Alzheimer's progression using a rabbit model of the disease.
Am J Neurodegener Dis 20140328 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of extracellular plaques of Î²-amyloid peptides and intracellular tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the brain. The vast majority of cases are late onset AD (LOAD), which are genetically heterogeneous and occur sporadically. High blood cholesterol is suggested to be a risk factor for this disease. Several neuropathological changes of LOAD can be reproduced by supplementing a rabbit's diet with 2% cholesterol for 12 weeks. Accumulating data in the literature suggest that microRNAs (miRNA) participate in the development of AD pathology. The present study focuses on the survey of changes of miRNA expression in rabbit brains during the progression of AD-like pathology using microarray followed by Taq-Man qRT-PCR analyses. Out of 1769 miRNA probes used in the experiments, 99 miRNAs were found to be present in rabbit brain, 57 were newly identified as miRNAs from rabbit brain. Eleven miRNAs showed significant changes over AD-like pathology progression. Among them, the changes of miR-125b, miR-98, miR-107, miR-30, along with 3 members of the let-7 family were similar to those observed in human AD samples, whereas the expression patterns of miR-15a, miR-26b, miR-9 and miR-576-3p were unique to this rabbit LOAD model. The significant up regulation of miR-26b is consistent with the decrease of leptin levels in the brains of cholesterol fed rabbit model for AD, confirming that miR-26b is indeed regulated by leptin and that both leptin and miR-26b may be involved in cholesterol induced AD-like pathology.  
24754002	Neuropathologic correlates of trial-related instruments for Alzheimer's disease.
Am J Neurodegener Dis 20140328 2014
To advance disease-modifying therapies, it is critical to understand the relationship between the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the clinical measures used in therapeutic trials. We reviewed neuropathologically proven cases of AD from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and examined correlations between neuropathological changes and clinical-trial related instruments collected as part of the Uniform Dataset (UDS). We explored the relationships between neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and total pathology burden with immediate and delayed recall, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes, Functional Activity Questionnaire, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores. 169 patients in NACC database had appropriate neuropathological and clinical data. All instruments correlated highly with neuritic plaques, Braak staging, and total pathology. Correlation coefficients for the relationships were relatively modest, suggesting that the pathologic burden examined accounts for between 13 and 40% of the variance of each of the instruments assessed. We conclude that there is a strong correlation between clinical trial-related measures and neuropathology identified at autopsy in AD. The amount of variance explained by the pathology is limited and other factors, both disease- and measurement-related, contribute to the variability observed in clinical measurements.  
24149932	Elevated CNS inflammation in patients with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 20131023 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that may involve inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS). Our objective was to determine whether patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a preclinical stage of AD, have inflammatory characteristics similar to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a known CNS inflammatory disease. The frequency of lymphocytes and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid of aMCI patients was comparable to MS patients or patients at high risk to develop MS. Thus, brain inflammation occurs early at the preclinical stage of AD and may have an important role in pathology.  
23892520	Diet, cognition, and Alzheimer's disease: food for thought.
Eur J Nutr 20130727 2014Feb
The prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a real challenge due to its rising prevalence and the lack of an effective cure. Diet and nutrients have gained significant interest as potentially modifiable protective factors. The aim of this review is to provide an updated summary of evidence related to the effect of diet and nutritional factors on the risk of AD and cognitive aging, and discuss the potential mechanisms and confounding factors involved. A search was conducted in Medline and Web of Knowledge for epidemiological and clinical studies in the international literature from January 2000 to February 2013 using combinations of the following keywords: "Alzheimer's disease", "mild cognitive impairment", "cognitive function", "dietary factors", "omega-3", "antioxidants", "B vitamins", "dietary patterns", and "Mediterranean diet". Data from observational studies point to a protective role for certain nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants or B vitamins, and dietary patterns (Mediterranean diet). However, data from randomized controlled trials do not show a consistent effect. Whether confounding factors such as age, disease stage, other dietary components, cooking processes, and other methodological issues explain the divergent results remains to be established. Moreover, if certain nutrients protect against dementia, it is as yet unknown whether they may have a general effect on brain vascular health or directly interfere with the etiopathogenesis of AD. 
24626757	SouvenaidÂ®: a new approach to management of early Alzheimer's disease.
J Nutr Health Aging  2014Mar
Synaptic loss correlates closely with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease and represents a new target for intervention. SouvenaidÂ® is the first medical nutrition product to be designed to support synapse formation and function in early Alzheimer's disease, and has undergone an extensive, 12-year development programme. The relatively large amount of clinical data available for SouvenaidÂ® is unusual for a medical nutrition product. SouvenaidÂ® contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid), uridine (as uridine monophosphate) and choline which are nutritional precursors required for synaptic membrane phospholipid synthesis, together with phospholipids and other cofactors. SouvenaidÂ® has demonstrated cognitive benefits in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease but not in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Two randomised, double-blind, controlled trials (duration 12 and 24 weeks) in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease untreated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine have demonstrated that SouvenaidÂ® is well tolerated and improves episodic memory performance. The daily intake of SouvenaidÂ® has not been associated with any harmful effects or interactions with medications and none are anticipated. The ongoing, 24-month, European Union-funded LipiDiDiet trial in subjects with prodromal Alzheimer's disease is evaluating the potential benefits of SouvenaidÂ® on memory and in slowing progression to Alzheimer's dementia. If SouvenaidÂ® induces synaptogenesis and improved synaptic function, it may provide benefits in other clinical conditions characterised by neurodegeneration. A number of trials are ongoing and planned to evaluate the potential wider benefits of SouvenaidÂ®.  
24629669	Network dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia: implications for psychiatry.
Biol. Psychiatry 20140204 2014Apr1
Structural and functional connectivity methods are changing how researchers conceptualize and explore neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we summarize emerging evidence of large-scale network dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, focusing on the divergent impact these disorders have on the default mode network and the salience network. We update a working model for understanding the functions of these networks within a broader anatomical context and highlight the relevance of this model for understanding psychiatric illness. Finally, we look ahead to persistent challenges in the application of network-based imaging methods to patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Recent advances and persistent needs are discussed, with an eye toward anticipating the hurdles that must be overcome for a network-based framework to clarify the biology of psychiatric illness and aid in the drug discovery process.  
24262299	Effects of a non-focal plasticity protocol on apathy in moderate Alzheimer's disease: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial.
Brain Stimul 20131025 2014 Mar-Apr
Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it is associated with changes in prefrontal neural circuits involved with generation of voluntary actions. To date no effective treatment for apathy has been demonstrated. We aimed to investigate the effects and safety of repetitive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on apathy in moderate AD patients. Forty patients were randomized to receive either active or sham-tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Patients received six sessions of intervention during 2 weeks and were evaluated at baseline, at week 1 and 2, and after 1 week without intervention. Clinical raters, patients, and caregivers were blinded. The primary outcome was apathy. Global cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms were examined as secondary outcomes. The mean MMSE score at baseline was 15.2 Â± 2.9 and the mean Apathy Scale score was 27.7 Â± 6.7. Changes on apathy scores over time were not different between active and sham tDCS (P = 0.552 for repeated measures). Further analyses confirm that changes from baseline did not differ between groups after the sixth session (active tDCS -1.95 (95%CI -3.49, -0.41); sham-tDCS -2.05 (95%CI -3.68, -0.42); P = 0.989]. Similarly, tDCS had no effect on secondary outcomes (P &gt; 0.40). tDCS was well tolerated and not associated with significant adverse effects. In this adequately powered study for minimal clinically significant difference, our findings show that using the parameters we chose for this study, repeated anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC had no effect on apathy in elderly patients with moderate AD. 
23512771	Perceptions of cause and control in people with Alzheimer's disease.
Gerontologist 20130319 2014Apr
To explore cause and control illness representations in older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Six older adults living in the North West of England completed semi-structured interviews that were subject to an interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three main themes emerged indicating that participants were trying to make sense of their AD by comparing it with their previous experience of physical health illnesses. All participants acknowledged their diagnosis of AD but engaged with it in a graded way because of a lack of tangible diagnostic evidence. Participants developed pragmatic emotional responses to their situation. One of the main implications of the results is that caution needs to be exercised within clinical practice so that the pragmatic responses of individuals with AD are not pathologized. 
24436131	Promoter hypermethylation of the phosphatase DUSP22 mediates PKA-dependent TAU phosphorylation and CREB activation in Alzheimer's disease.
Hippocampus 20140128 2014Apr
Genetic screening in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has identified only a handful of genes that are mutated in the disorder. Thus, for a very large proportion of patients, the biology of their disease is poorly understood. Epigenetic alterations may provide an explanation in these cases. Using DNA methylation profiles of human hippocampus from controls and patients, we have identified the presence of promoter hypermethylation of the dual-specificity phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) gene in AD. DUSP22 is a likely candidate gene for involvement in the pathogenesis of the disorder since, as we demonstrate here, it inhibits PKA activity and thereby determines TAU phosphorylation status and CREB signaling. 
24412377	The treatment of Alzheimer's disease using Chinese medicinal plants: from disease models to potential clinical applications.
J Ethnopharmacol 20140109 2014Mar28
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the sustained higher nervous disorders of the activities and functions of the brain. Due to its heavy burden on society and the patients' families, it is urgent to review the treatments for AD to provide basic data for further research and new drug development. Among these treatments, Chinese Material Medica (CMM) has been traditionally clinical used in China to treat AD for a long time with obvious efficacy. With the further research reports of CMM, new therapeutic materials may be recovered from troves of CMM. However, So far, little or no review work has been reported to conclude anti-AD drugs from CMM in literature. Therefore, a systematic introduction of CMM anti-AD research progress is of great importance and necessity. This paper strives to systematically describe the progress of CMM in the treatment of AD, and lays a basis data for anti-AD drug development from CMM, and provides the essential theoretical support for the further development and utilization of CMM resources through a more comprehensive research of the variety of databases regarding CMM anti-AD effects reports. Literature survey was performed via electronic search (SciFinderÂ®, PubmedÂ®, Google Scholar and Web of Science) on papers and patents and by systematic research in ethnopharmacological literature at various university libraries. This review mainly introduces the current research on the Chinese Material Medica (CMM) theoretical research on Alzheimer's disease (AD), anti-AD active constituent of CMM, anti-AD effects on AD models, anti-AD mechanism of CMM, and anti-AD effect of CMM formula. Scholars around the world have made studies on the anti-AD molecular mechanism of CMM from different pathways, and have made substantial progress. The progress not only enriched the anti-AD theory of CMM, but also provided clinical practical significance and development prospects in using CMM to treat AD. Western pure drugs cannot replace the advantages of CMM in the anti-AD aspect. Therefore, in the near future, the development of CMM anti-AD drugs with a more clearly role and practical data will be a major trend in the field of AD drug development, and it will promote the use of CMM. 
24632849	Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease in Chinese population: a meta-analysis.
Sci Rep 20140317 2014
The relationship between Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is relatively well established in Caucasians, but less established in other ethnicities. To examine the association between ApoE polymorphism and the onset of AD in Chinese population, we searched the commonly used electronic databases between January 2000 and November 2013 for relevant studies. Total 20 studies, including 1576 cases and 1741 controls, were retrieved. The results showed statistically significant positive association between risk factor Îµ4 allele carriers and AD in Chinese population (OR = 3.93, 95% CI = 3.37-4.58, P &lt; 0.00001). Genotype ApoE Îµ4/Îµ4 and Îµ4/Îµ3 have statistically significant association with AD as well (Îµ4/Îµ4: OR = 11.76, 95% CI = 6.38-21.47, P &lt; 0.00001; Îµ4/Îµ3: OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 2.57-3.69, P &lt; 0.00001). Furthermore, the frequency of the ApoE Îµ3 is lower in AD than that in the health controls, and the difference of Îµ3 allele is also statistically significant (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.37-0.47, P &lt; 0.00001). No significant heterogeneity was observed among all studies. This meta-analysis suggests that the subject with at least one ApoE Îµ4 allele has higher risk suffering from AD than controls in Chinese population. The results also provide a support for the protection effect of ApoE Îµ3 allele in developing AD.  
24635394	Rationale and clinical data supporting nutritional intervention in Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Clin Belg  2014 Jan-Feb
Adequate nutrition plays an important role in the maintenance of cognitive function, particularly during aging. Malnutrition is amongst the risk factors for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological studies have associated deficiencies in some nutrients with a higher risk of cognitive dysfunction and/or AD. Cognitive decline in AD is correlated with synaptic loss and many of the components required to maintain optimal synaptic function are derived from dietary sources. As synapses are part of the neuronal membrane and are continuously being remodelled, the availability of sufficient levels of nutritional precursors (mainly uridine monophosphate, choline and omega-3 fatty acids) to make the phospholipids required to build neuronal membranes may have beneficial effects on synaptic degeneration in AD. In addition, B-vitamins, phospholipids and other micronutrients act as cofactors to enhance the supply of precursors required to make neuronal membranes and synapses. Despite this, no randomized controlled trial has hitherto provided evidence that any single nutrient has a beneficial effect on cognition or lowers the risk for AD. However, a multi-target approach using combinations of (micro)nutrients might have beneficial effects on cognitive function in neurodegenerative brain disorders like AD leading to synaptic degeneration. Here we review the clinical evidence for supplementation, based on a multi-target approach with a focus on key nutrients with a proposed role in synaptic dysfunction. Based on preclinical evidence, a nutrient mixture, Souvenaid(Â®) (Nutricia N.V., Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) was developed. Clinical trials with Souvenaid(Â®) have shown improved memory performance in patients with mild AD. Further clinical trials to evaluate the effects of nutritional intervention in MCI and early dementia due to AD are on-going.  
24612772	The Chinese version of story recall: a useful screening tool for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly.
BMC Psychiatry 20140310 2014
Decline in verbal episodic memory is a core feature of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The delayed story recall (DSR) test from the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (AMIPB) discriminates MCI from normal aging and predicts its conversion to Alzheimer's dementia. However, there is no study that validates the Chinese version of the DSR and reports cut-off scores in the Chinese population. A total of 631 subjects were screened in the memory clinics of Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, China. 249 were considered to have normal cognition (NC), 134 met diagnostic criteria for MCI according to the MCI Working Group of the European Consortium on Alzheimer's Disease, and 97 met criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria, 14 exhibited vascular dementia (VaD), and 50 had a diagnosis of another type of dementia. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to calculate the story recall cutoff score for detecting MCI and AD. Normative data in the NC group were obtained as a function of age and education. In this Chinese sample, the normative mean DSR score was 28.10 Â± 8.54 in the 50-64 year-old group, 26.22 Â± 8.38 in the 65-74 year-old group, and 24.42 Â± 8.38 in the 75-85 year-old group. DSR performance was influenced by age and education. The DSR test had high sensitivity (0.899) and specificity (0.799) in the detection of MCI from NC using a cut-off score of 15.5. When the cutoff score was 10.5, the DSR test obtained optimal sensitivity (0.980) and specificity (0.938) in the discrimination of AD from NC. Cutoff scores and diagnostic values were calculated stratified by age and education. The Chinese version of the DSR can be used as a screening tool to detect MCI and AD with high sensitivity and specificity, and it could be used to identify people at high risk of cognitive impairment. 
24656052	Atherosclerosis and Alzheimer - diseases with a common cause? Inflammation, oxysterols, vasculature.
BMC Geriatr 20140321 2014
Aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to pathologies such as atherosclerosis (ATH) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Are these different pathologies, or different presentations with a similar underlying pathoetiology? Both ATH and AD involve inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and occlusion of the vasculature. Allelic variants in common genes including APOE predispose to both diseases. In both there is strong evidence of disease association with viral and bacterial pathogens including herpes simplex and Chlamydophila. Furthermore, ablation of components of the immune system (or of bone marrow-derived macrophages alone) in animal models restricts disease development in both cases, arguing that both are accentuated by inflammatory/immune pathways. We discuss that amyloid Î², a distinguishing feature of AD, also plays a key role in ATH. Several drugs, at least in mouse models, are effective in preventing the development of both ATH and AD. Given similar age-dependence, genetic underpinnings, involvement of the vasculature, association with infection, AÎ² involvement, the central role of macrophages, and drug overlap, we conclude that the two conditions reflect different manifestations of a common pathoetiology. Infection and inflammation selectively induce the expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). Acutely, the production of 'immunosterol' 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) defends against enveloped viruses. We present evidence that chronic macrophage CH25H upregulation leads to catalyzed esterification of sterols via 25OHC-driven allosteric activation of ACAT (acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase/SOAT), intracellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters and lipid droplets, vascular occlusion, and overt disease. We postulate that AD and ATH are both caused by chronic immunologic challenge that induces CH25H expression and protection against particular infectious agents, but at the expense of longer-term pathology. 
24636630	Comparison of alterations in cerebral hemoglobin oxygenation in late life depression and Alzheimer's disease as assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy.
Behav Brain Funct 20140317 2014
Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often present with apathy symptoms resembling the decreased motivation observed in depressed patients. Therefore, differentiating the initial phase of AD from late life depression may be difficult in some cases. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a functional neuroimaging modality that uses near-infrared light to measure changes in hemoglobin concentration on the cortical surface during activation tasks. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in brain activation associated with late life depression and with AD by means of NIRS. NIRS was performed in 30 patients with depression, 28 patients with AD, and 33 healthy controls, all aged 60 years or older. During two tasks, a verbal fluency task and a visuospatial task, changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in the frontal and parietal cortices were investigated. In the visuospatial task, cortical activation was lower in the depressed group than in the AD group, and significant differences were observed in the parietal cortex. NIRS can detect differences in brain activation between patients with late life depression and those with AD. NIRS is a promising tool for the differential diagnosis of late life depression and AD. 
24650677	Epigenetic modifications of chronic hypoxia-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
Transl Neurodegener 20140320 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly people. AD is characterized by progressive and gradual decline in cognitive function and memory loss. While familial early-onset AD is usually associated with gene mutations, the etiology of sporadic late-onset form of AD is largely unknown. It has been reported that environmental factors and epigenetic alterations significantly contribute to the process of AD. Our previous studies have documented that chronic hypoxia is one of the environmental factors that may trigger the AD development and aggravate the disease progression. In this review, we will summarize the pathological effects of chronic hypoxia on the onset and development of AD and put forward the possible molecule mechanisms underlying the chronic hypoxia mediated AD pathogenesis. Finally, we propose that epigenetic regulations may represent new opportunity for the therapeutic intervention of this disease.  
24758091	[Progress of experimental research on treating Alzheimer's disease by acupuncture].
Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi  2014Mar
To discuss the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we summarized the mechanisms of treating AD animal models by acupuncture from literatures in recent years as follows. Senile dementia rats' cognitive capabilities and memory could be improved by reduction of beta-amyloid protein, attenuation of excessive phosphorylation of tau protein, regulation of center neurotransmitter dysmetabolism, oxidation of anti-free radicals, reduction of neuron apoptosis in the cortex and the hippocampus, inhibition of glial cells' differentiation, adjustment of G protein signaling transduction, and improvement of the mitochondrial dysfunction, thus providing experimental evidence for treating AD by acupuncture. 
23916950	Herpes virus in Alzheimer's disease: relation to progression of the disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130803 2014Jan
Studies regarding different viruses of the herpes family, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are scarce. DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and brain samples were analyzed for the presence of CMV, EBV, or HHV-6. All samples were negative for CMV. EBV positivity was 6% in AD brains, whereas 45% of PBL samples from AD patients and 31% from controls were positive for EBV (p = 0.05). HHV-6 showed a 23% positivity in PBL samples from AD and 4% from controls (p = 0.002). 17% of AD brains were HHV-6 positive. Within a group of elderly individuals, followed up for 5 years, EBV-positive or HHV-6-positive PBL increased in those who developed clinical AD. Virus serological positivity was also investigated, and IgG levels for CMV and EBV antigens were also increased in those subjects who developed AD during the follow-up. Our findings suggest that EBV and HHV-6 may be environmental risk factors for cognitive deterioration and progression to AD in elderly persons. 
23932880	L-type Ca2+ currents at CA1 synapses, but not CA3 or dentate granule neuron synapses, are increased in 3xTgAD mice in an age-dependent manner.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130807 2014Jan
Abnormal neuronal excitability and impaired synaptic plasticity might occur before the degeneration and death of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To elucidate potential biophysical alterations underlying aberrant neuronal network activity in AD, we performed whole-cell patch clamp analyses of L-type (nifedipine-sensitive) Ca(2+) currents (L-VGCC), 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K(+) currents, and AMPA (2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) currents in CA1, CA3, and dentate granule neurons in hippocampal slices from young, middle-age, and old 3xTgAD mice and age-matched wild type mice. 3xTgAD mice develop progressive widespread accumulation of amyloid Î²-peptide, and selective hyperphosphorylated tau pathology in hippocampal CA1 neurons, which are associated with cognitive deficits, but independent of overt neuronal degeneration. An age-related elevation of L-type Ca(2+) channel current density occurred in CA1 neurons in 3xTgAD mice, but not in wild type mice, with the magnitude being significantly greater in older 3xTgAD mice. The NMDA current was also significantly elevated in CA1 neurons of old 3xTgAD mice compared with in old wild type mice. There were no differences in the amplitude of K(+) or AMPA currents in CA1 neurons of 3xTgAD mice compared with wild type mice at any age. There were no significant differences in Ca(2+), K(+), AMPA, or NMDA currents in CA3 and dentate neurons from 3xTgAD mice compared with wild type mice at any age. Our results reveal an age-related increase of L-VGCC density in CA1 neurons, but not in CA3 or dentate granule neurons, of 3xTgAD mice. These findings suggest a potential contribution of altered L-VGCC to the selective vulnerability of CA1 neurons to tau pathology in the 3xTgAD mice and to their degeneration in AD patients.  
23954169	Dual-energy precursor and nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 activator treatment additively improve redox glutathione levels and neuron survival in aging and Alzheimer mouse neurons upstream of reactive oxygen species.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130815 2014Jan
To determine whether glutathione (GSH) loss or increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are more important to neuron loss, aging, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), we stressed or boosted GSH levels in neurons isolated from aging 3xTg-AD neurons compared with those from age-matched nontransgenic (non-Tg) neurons. Here, using titrating with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of Î³-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (GCL), we observed that GSH depletion increased neuronal death of 3xTg-AD cultured neurons at increasing rates across the age span, whereas non-Tg neurons were resistant to GSH depletion until old age. Remarkably, the rate of neuron loss with ROS did not increase in old age and was the same for both genotypes, which indicates that cognitive deficits in the AD model were not caused by ROS. Therefore, we targeted for neuroprotection activation of the redox sensitive transcription factor, nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by 18 alpha glycyrrhetinic acid to stimulate GSH synthesis through GCL. This balanced stimulation of a number of redox enzymes restored the lower levels of Nrf2 and GCL seen in 3xTg-AD neurons compared with those of non-Tg neurons and promoted translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. By combining the Nrf2 activator together with the NADH precursor, nicotinamide, we increased neuron survival against amyloid beta stress in an additive manner. These stress tests and neuroprotective treatments suggest that the redox environment is more important for neuron survival than ROS. The dual neuroprotective treatment with nicotinamide and an Nrf2 inducer indicates that these age-related and AD-related changes are reversible.  
23954170	Nardilysin prevents amyloid plaque formation by enhancing Î±-secretase activity in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130815 2014Jan
Amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide, the main component of senile plaques in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), is derived from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Î²- and Î³-secretases. Alpha-cleavage of APP by Î±-secretase has a potential to preclude the generation of AÎ² because it occurs within the AÎ² domain. We previously reported that a metalloendopeptidase, nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase; NRDc) enhances Î±-cleavage of APP, which results in the decreased generation of AÎ² in vitro. To clarify the in vivo role of NRDc in AD, we intercrossed transgenic mice expressing NRDc in the forebrain with an AD mouse model. Here we demonstrate that the neuron-specific overexpression of NRDc prevents AÎ² deposition in the AD mouse model. The activity of Î±-secretase in the mouse brain was enhanced by the overexpression of NRDc, and was reduced by the deletion of NRDc. However, reactive gliosis adjacent to the AÎ² plaques, one of the pathological features of AD, was not affected by the overexpression of NRDc. Taken together, our results indicate that NRDc controls AÎ² formation through the regulation of Î±-secretase. 
23954171	Selective benefits of simvastatin in bitransgenic APPSwe,Ind/TGF-Î²1 mice.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130815 2014Jan
Cognitive and cerebrovascular deficits are 2 landmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to target for effective therapy. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of simvastatin in bitransgenic A/T mice overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe,Ind)) and a constitutively active form of transforming growth factor-Î²1. These mice feature the AD amyloid beta (AÎ²) and cerebrovascular pathology. Simvastatin significantly decreased insoluble AÎ² peptide levels and AÎ² plaque load despite no effect on Î²-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme and AÎ²-degrading enzyme neprilysin protein levels. However, simvastatin failed to improve spatial learning and memory deficits and the decreased baseline levels of the memory-related protein early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in the hippocampus CA1 area. The impaired hyperemic response to whisker stimulation in A/T mice was not improved with treatment, but simvastatin fully restored constitutive nitric oxide synthesis in vessel walls and exacerbated agonist-mediated dilatory deficits. These findings point to the efficacy of simvastatin on selective AD features in a complex model of the disease, likely reflecting the challenges faced by recent clinical trials in assessing statin efficacy. 
23954175	Comparison of neuroimaging modalities for the prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130815 2014Jan
In this study we compared Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose PET for metabolism, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for structure to predict conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Numeric neuroimaging variables generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-funded laboratories for each neuroimaging modality along with apolipoprotein-E genotype (n = 29) were analyzed. Performance of these biomarkers for predicting conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia at 2 years was evaluated in 50 late amnestic MCI subjects, 20 of whom converted. Multivariate modeling found that among individual modalities, MRI had the highest predictive accuracy (67%) which increased by 9% to 76% when combined with PIB-PET, producing the highest accuracy among any biomarker combination. Individually, PIB-PET generated the best sensitivity, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET had the lowest. Among individual brain regions, the temporal cortex was found to be most predictive for MRI and PIB-PET. 
23962497	MicroRNAs in Alzheimer's disease: differential expression in hippocampus and cell-free cerebrospinal fluid.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130817 2014Jan
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that function in complex networks to regulate protein expression. In the brain, they are involved in development and synaptic plasticity. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs with a differential expression in either hippocampus or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched nondemented control subjects using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In hippocampus, we also differentiated between AD patients with an intermediate stage, according to Braak III/IV stage, and a late stage, characterized according to Braak VI stage. Eight selected miRNAs were analyzed in hippocampus, and the expression of miR-16, miR-34c, miR-107, miR-128a, and miR-146a were differentially regulated. In CSF, out of 8 selected miRNAs only miR-16 and miR-146a could be reliably detected. In addition, we identified an effect of blood contamination on the CSF levels of miR-16, miR-24, and miR-146a. For group comparisons, we therefore selected CSF samples absent of, or containing only low numbers of blood cells. Levels of miR-146a were significantly decreased in CSF of AD patients. In conclusion, the abnormal expression of several miRNAs in hippocampus of intermediate- and late-stage AD patients suggests their involvement in AD pathogenesis, and low levels of miR-146a in CSF were associated with AD.  
23969178	Blood pressure decrease correlates with tau pathology and memory decline in hypertensive elderly.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130819 2014Jan
In hypertension (HTN), cerebral blood flow regulation limits are changed, and the threshold for blood pressure (BP) at which perfusion is safely maintained is higher. This shift may increase the brain's vulnerability to lower BP in subjects with vascular disease. We investigated whether longitudinal reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was related to changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in a group of cognitively healthy elderly with and without HTN. The relationships among MAP, memory decline, and hippocampal atrophy were also examined. Seventy-seven subjects (age 63.4 Â± 9.4, range 44-86 years; education 16.9 Â± 2.1, range 10-22 years; 60% women) were assessed twice, 2 Â± 0.5 years apart. At both time points, all subjects underwent full medical and neuropsychological evaluations, lumbar punctures, and magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Twenty-five subjects had HTN. Hyper- and normotensive subjects did not differ in their CSF biomarkers, hippocampal volumes (HipVs), or memory scores at baseline. In the entire study group, the increase in tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau(181)) was associated with a decline in verbal episodic memory (Î² = -0.30, p = 0.01) and HipV reduction (Î² = -0.27, p = 0.02). However, longitudinal decrease in MAP was related to memory decline (Î² = 0.50, p = 0.01) and an increase in p-tau(181) (Î² = -0.50, p = 0.01) only in subjects with HTN. Our findings suggest that the hypertensive group may be sensitive to BP reductions. 
23973442	Klotho upregulation contributes to the neuroprotection of ligustilide in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130821 2014Jan
Klotho, an aging-suppressor gene, encodes a protein that potentially acts as a neuroprotective factor by modulating insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling and oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of Klotho in the therapeutic effect of ligustilide against Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathologies and memory impairment in aged senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) mice. Ligustilide treatment (10 and 40 mg/kg for 8 weeks, intragastrically) in 10-month-old SAMP8 mice reduced memory deficits, amyloid-Î²(1)-42 accumulation, tau phosphorylation, and neuron loss, increased mitochondrial manganese-superoxide dismutase and catalase expression and activity, and decreased malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, and 8-hydroxydesoxyguanosine levels in the brain. Ligustilide upregulated Klotho expression in the cerebral choroid plexus and serum, decreased Akt and Forkhead box class O1 phosphorylation. Moreover, ligustilide inhibited the insulin-like growth factor 1 pathway and induced Forkhead box class O1 activation in 293T cells along with Klotho upregulation. An inverse correlation was found between Klotho expression and the AD phenotype, suggesting that Klotho might be a novel therapeutic target for age-related AD, and Klotho upregulation might contribute to the neuroprotective effect of ligustilide against AD. 
23993701	Glycogen synthase kinase-3Î²-mediated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta phosphorylation in astrocytes promotes migration and activation of microglia/macrophages.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130829 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease is neuropathologically characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-Î² protein into senile plaques that are sites of chronic inflammation involving reactive microglia, astrocytes, and proinflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor-Î±. The human CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) delta (CEBPD) is known to be induced in many inflammation-related diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, this protein is responsive to amyloid-Î² and proinflammatory cytokines in astrocytes. However, the functional role of CEBPD in astrocytes remains largely unclear. In this study, we show that CEBPD is upregulated by interleukin-1Î² through the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (MAPKp38) signaling pathway and phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3Î² at Ser167 in astrocytes. CEBPD in astrocytes is associated with microglia activation and migration in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (AppTg) mice. We further identified that the monocyte chemotactic protein-1, a chemoattractive factor, and migration factors matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -3 are responsive to GSK3Î²-mediated CEBPD Ser167 phosphorylation. Our results revealed the novel regulation of LiCl on astrocytes and that GSK3Î²-mediated CEBPD phosphorylation in astrocytes plays an important role in the activation of microglia.  
23993702	Respiratory infection promotes T cell infiltration and amyloid-Î² deposition in APP/PS1 mice.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130829 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by deposits of amyloid-Î² and neurofibrillary tangles. It has been suggested that inflammatory changes are associated with disease; however, it has not been established whether these are a consequence of ongoing neurodegeneration or whether inflammation itself contributes to disease pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that exposure to infection can accelerate cognitive decline in AD patients, and pathogens have been detected in the AD brain. However, the influence of infection on neuroinflammation and pathology remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effect of a peripheral infection on AD pathology in APP/PS1 mice. We found that, 8 weeks after infection with the Gram negative respiratory pathogen Bordetella pertussis, there was significant infiltration of IFNÎ³- and IL-17-producing T cells and NKT cells in older APP/PS1 mice. This was accompanied by increased glial activation and amyloid-Î² deposition. The data suggest that infection is a critical factor in the progression of AD, emphasising the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of infections in elderly individuals.  
24475133	Effect of BDNF Val66Met on memory decline and hippocampal atrophy in prodromal Alzheimer's disease: a preliminary study.
PLoS ONE 20140127 2014
Cross-sectional genetic association studies have reported equivocal results on the relationship between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As AD is a neurodegenerative disease, genetic influences may become clearer from prospective study. We aimed to determine whether BDNF Val66Met polymorphism influences changes in memory performance, hippocampal volume, and AÎ² accumulation in adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and high AÎ². Thirty-four adults with aMCI were recruited from the Australian, Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study. Participants underwent PiB-PET and structural MRI neuroimaging, neuropsychological assessments and BDNF genotyping at baseline, 18 month, and 36 month assessments. In individuals with aMCI and high AÎ², Met carriers showed significant and large decline in episodic memory (dâ€Š=â€Š0.90, pâ€Š=â€Š.020) and hippocampal volume (dâ€Š=â€Š0.98, pâ€Š=â€Š.035). BDNF Val66Met was unrelated to the rate of AÎ² accumulation (dâ€Š=â€Š-0.35, pâ€Š=â€Š.401). Although preliminary due to the small sample size, results of this study suggest that high AÎ² levels and Met carriage may be useful prognostic markers of accelerated decline in episodic memory, and reductions in hippocampal volume in individuals in the prodromal or MCI stage of AD. 
24475144	The effect of souvenaid on functional brain network organisation in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomised controlled study.
PLoS ONE 20140127 2014
Synaptic loss is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disturbed organisation of large-scale functional brain networks in AD might reflect synaptic loss and disrupted neuronal communication. The medical food Souvenaid, containing the specific nutrient combination Fortasyn Connect, is designed to enhance synapse formation and function and has been shown to improve memory performance in patients with mild AD in two randomised controlled trials. To explore the effect of Souvenaid compared to control product on brain activity-based networks, as a derivative of underlying synaptic function, in patients with mild AD. A 24-week randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-country study. 179 drug-naÃ¯ve mild AD patients who participated in the Souvenir II study. Patients were randomised 1âˆ¶1 to receive Souvenaid or an iso-caloric control product once daily for 24 weeks. In a secondary analysis of the Souvenir II study, electroencephalography (EEG) brain networks were constructed and graph theory was used to quantify complex brain structure. Local brain network connectivity (normalised clustering coefficient gamma) and global network integration (normalised characteristic path length lambda) were compared between study groups, and related to memory performance. THE NETWORK MEASURES IN THE BETA BAND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN GROUPS: they decreased in the control group, but remained relatively unchanged in the active group. No consistent relationship was found between these network measures and memory performance. The current results suggest that Souvenaid preserves the organisation of brain networks in patients with mild AD within 24 weeks, hypothetically counteracting the progressive network disruption over time in AD. The results strengthen the hypothesis that Souvenaid affects synaptic integrity and function. Secondly, we conclude that advanced EEG analysis, using the mathematical framework of graph theory, is useful and feasible for assessing the effects of interventions. Dutch Trial Register NTR1975. 
24081144	Allelic interference: a mechanism for trans-dominant transmission of loss of function in the neurodegeneration of familial Alzheimer's disease.
Neurodegener Dis 20130924 2014
Presenilins (PSs) are catalytic components of the Î³-secretase complexes that promote the Îµ-cleavage of cell surface proteins producing cytosolic peptides shown to function in cell signaling and gene expression. In addition, secretase cleavages at Î³-sites of amyloid precursor protein substrates produce the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides found in all people. Aggregation of AÎ² peptides form the amyloid fibrils found in amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and aged individuals. A common hypothesis suggests that AD is caused by aggregated AÎ² peptides, but treatments with either inhibitors of AÎ² production or anti-AÎ² antibodies showed no therapeutic value. Importantly, recent evidence [Marambaud et al.: Cell 2003;114:635-645] shows that PS familial AD (FAD) mutations cause a loss of Î³-secretase cleavage function at the Îµ-site of substrates manifested by a decreased production of cytosolic peptides and an accumulation of transmembrane Î³-secretase substrates. These data support the hypothesis that PS FAD mutations promote neurotoxicity by inhibiting the Î³-secretase-catalyzed Îµ-cleavage of substrates, thus reducing cell signaling while causing accumulation of membrane-bound cytotoxic peptides. Similar mechanisms may be involved in toxicities observed in clinical trials of Î³-secretase inhibitors. A model of allelic interference may explain the dominant negative transmission of neurotoxic loss of function in FAD neurodegeneration. 
24559670	ApoE and AÎ² in Alzheimer's disease: accidental encounters or partners?
Neuron  2014Feb19
Among the three human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms, apoE4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While transporting cholesterol is a primary function, apoE also regulates amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) metabolism, aggregation, and deposition. Although earlier work suggests that different affinities of apoE isoforms to AÎ² might account for their effects on AÎ² clearance, recent studies indicate that apoE also competes with AÎ² for cellular uptake through apoE receptors. Thus, several factors probably determine the variable effects apoE has on AÎ². In this Review, we examine biochemical, structural, and functional studies and propose testable models that address the complex mechanisms underlying apoE-AÎ² interaction and how apoE4 may increase AD risk and also serve as a target pathway for therapy.  
24453080	APOE Îµ4 worsens hippocampal CA1 apical neuropil atrophy and episodic memory.
Neurology 20140122 2014Feb25
Using high-resolution structural MRI, we endeavored to study the relationships among APOE Îµ4, hippocampal subfield and stratal anatomy, and episodic memory. Using a cross-sectional design, we studied 11 patients with Alzheimer disease dementia, 14 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and 14 age-matched healthy controls with no group differences in APOE Îµ4 carrier status. Each subject underwent ultra-high-field 7.0-tesla MRI targeted to the hippocampus and neuropsychological assessment. We found a selective, dose-dependent association of APOE Îµ4 with greater thinning of the CA1 apical neuropil, or stratum radiatum/stratum lacunosum-moleculare (CA1-SRLM), a hippocampal subregion known to exhibit early vulnerability to neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer disease. The relationship between the Îµ4 allele and CA1-SRLM thinning persisted after controlling for dementia severity, and the size of other hippocampal subfields and the entorhinal cortex did not differ by APOE Îµ4 carrier status. Carriers also exhibited worse episodic memory function but similar performance in other cognitive domains compared with noncarriers. In a statistical mediation analysis, we found support for the hypothesis that CA1-SRLM thinning may link the APOE Îµ4 allele to its phenotypic effects on memory. The APOE Îµ4 allele segregated dose-dependently and selectively with CA1-SRLM thinning and worse episodic memory performance in a pool of older subjects across a cognitive spectrum. These findings highlight a possible role for this gene in influencing a critical hippocampal subregion and an associated symptomatic manifestation. 
24477112	Confidentiality in preclinical Alzheimer disease studies: when research and medical records meet.
Neurology 20140129 2014Feb25
Clinical trials to advance the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) may expose research subjects to discrimination risks. An individual enrolled in a research study that uses positive test results from amyloid PET imaging or CSF measures of Î²-amyloid 42 as inclusion criteria has biomarkers indicative of AD pathology. If insurers and employers learn this information, it could expose subjects to discrimination. Unfortunately, current legal and regulatory mechanisms are not sufficient to protect against harms that have significant consequences for subjects. Existing law that prohibits employment and insurance discrimination based on genetic status does not apply to amyloid biomarkers or any other biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Gaps in legal protections fail to protect research subjects from discrimination by long-term care and disability insurers. This risk is particularly concerning because individuals with AD dementia ultimately need long-term care services. To maximize subject protections and advance valuable research, policymakers, investigators, and research institutions must address shortcomings in the design of the electronic medical record, revise laws to limit discrimination, and develop practices that inform research participants of risks associated with loss of confidentiality.  
24477113	Prevalence of cortical superficial siderosis in a memory clinic population.
Neurology 20140129 2014Feb25
To determine prevalence, topography, and severity of cortical superficial siderosis (SS), a recently recognized manifestation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and its possible association with Alzheimer disease (AD) in a memory clinic patient cohort. We included 809 patients (56% men, aged 66 Â± 10 years) from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort between November 2010 and November 2012 scanned on a 3-tesla MRI system. We analyzed prevalence and topography of cortical SS according to demographic, clinical, and MRI data. Agreement for SS detection between 2 neuroradiologists was calculated by using Cohen Îº. Agreement for detection of SS was excellent (unweighted Îº of 0.81). In 17 patients (2.1%), cortical SS was found without a known cause. The prevalence of idiopathic SS differed according to diagnostic groups (p &lt; 0.001): nearly 5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8%-8.2%) in patients with AD (n = 168) vs 2% (95% CI 0.7%-6.0%) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 143) and 2.5% (95% CI 0.7%-8.7%) in other types of dementia (n = 80). By contrast, SS was not found in patients with subjective complaints (n = 168) or in those with other disorders (n = 157). Presence of SS was associated with APOE Îµ4, microbleeds, and white matter hyperintensities (all p &lt; 0.05) independent of diagnosis. The prevalence of cortical SS in a memory clinic setting is higher than reported in the general population but lower than reported in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The relatively high prevalence of SS in AD suggests that SS is a relevant radiologic manifestation of amyloid pathology in AD. Presence of SS does not seem to predict severity of AD. Further longitudinal research is needed to investigate clinical relevance. 
24621690	Increased hippocampal excitability in the 3xTgAD mouse model for Alzheimer's disease in vivo.
PLoS ONE 20140312 2014
Mouse Alzheimer's disease (AD) models develop age- and region-specific pathology throughout the hippocampal formation. One recently established pathological correlate is an increase in hippocampal excitability in vivo. Hippocampal pathology also produces episodic memory decline in human AD and we have shown a similar episodic deficit in 3xTg AD model mice aged 3-6 months. Here, we tested whether hippocampal synaptic dysfunction accompanies this cognitive deficit by probing dorsal CA1 and DG synaptic responses in anaesthetized, 4-6 month-old 3xTgAD mice. As our previous reports highlighted a decline in episodic performance in aged control mice, we included aged cohorts for comparison. CA1 and DG responses to low-frequency perforant path stimulation were comparable between 3xTgAD and controls at both age ranges. As expected, DG recordings in controls showed paired-pulse depression; however, paired-pulse facilitation was observed in DG and CA1 of young and old 3xTgAD mice. During stimulus trains both short-latency (presumably monosynaptic: 'direct') and long-latency (presumably polysynaptic: 're-entrant') responses were observed. Facilitation of direct responses was modest in 3xTgAD animals. However, re-entrant responses in DG and CA1 of young 3xTgAD mice developed earlier in the stimulus train and with larger amplitude when compared to controls. Old mice showed less DG paired-pulse depression and no evidence for re-entrance. In summary, DG and CA1 responses to low-frequency stimulation in all groups were comparable, suggesting no loss of synaptic connectivity in 3xTgAD mice. However, higher-frequency activation revealed complex change in synaptic excitability in DG and CA1 of 3xTgAD mice. In particular, short-term plasticity in DG and CA1 was facilitated in 3xTgAD mice, most evidently in younger animals. In addition, re-entrance was facilitated in young 3xTgAD mice. Overall, these data suggest that the episodic-like memory deficit in 3xTgAD mice could be due to the development of an abnormal hyper-excitable state in the hippocampal formation.  
23538412	Genetics of Alzheimer disease.
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 20130328 2014Mar
Alzheimer disease prevails as a major cause of disability in the elderly population and ranks as the most common form of dementia that affects 1 of 8 individuals older than 65 years of age. Most AD cases are late in onset and are probably influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Apart from age, the risk factors include family history; brain injury, both traumatic and vascular; and metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. Based on twin studies, inheritance plays a role in approximately 80% of cases (familial and sporadic). 
23988753	Evaluation of common structural brain changes in aging and Alzheimer disease with the use of an MRI-based brain atrophy and lesion index: a comparison between T1WI and T2WI at 1.5T and 3T.
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 20130829 2014Mar
The Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index combines several common, aging-related structural brain changes and has been validated for high-field MR imaging. In this study, we evaluated measurement properties of the Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index by use of T1WI and T2WI at 1.5T and 3T MR imaging to comprehensively assess the usefulness of the lower field-strength testing. Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Images of subjects (n = 127) who had T1WI and T2WI at both 3T and 1.5T on the same day were evaluated, applying the Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index rating. Criterion and construct validity and interrater agreement were tested for each field strength and image type. Regarding reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficients for the Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index score were consistently high (&gt;0.81) across image type and field strength. Regarding construct validity, the Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index score differed among diagnostic groups, being lowest in people without cognitive impairment and highest in those with Alzheimer disease (F &gt; 5.14; P &lt; .007). Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index scores correlated with age (r &gt; 0.37, P &lt; .001) and cognitive performance (r &gt; 0.38, P &lt; .001) and were associated with positive amyloid-Î² test (F &gt; 3.96, P &lt; .050). The T1WI and T2WI Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index scores were correlated (r &gt; 0.93, P &lt; .001), with the T2WI scores slightly greater than the T1WI scores (F &gt; 4.25, P &lt; .041). Regarding criterion validation of the 1.5T images, the 1.5T scores were highly correlated with the 3T Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index scores (r &gt; 0.93, P &lt; .001). The higher field and T2WI more sensitively detect subtle changes in the deep white matter and perivascular spaces in particular. Even so, 1.5T Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index scores are similar to those obtained by use of 3T images. The Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index may have use in quantifying the impact of dementia on brain structures. 
24625043	Telephone screening for mild cognitive impairment in hispanics using the Alzheimer's questionnaire.
Exp Aging Res  2014
BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: There is a need for a simple and reliable screening test to detect individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The authors analyzed the relationship between performance of the Alzheimer's Questionnaire (AQ), an informant-rated measure of dementia-related behaviors, relative to the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified (TICS-m), Memory Impairment Scale-telephone version (MIS-t), and the Telephone Executive Assessment (TEXAS) as predictors of MCI. Comparative cross-sectional design, with data collected from participants in the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium's (TARCC) San Antonio site. One-hundred percent of our sample was Hispanic. The San Antonio subset of TARCC sample is highly enriched with Mexican Americans (MAs). Fifty-five percent of the interviews were conducted in Spanish. Of the 184 persons enrolled, 124 were normal controls (NCs), and 60 participants had MCI. MCI status and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) were determined through clinical consensus and performed blind to telephone assessments. Controlling for age, gender, education, and language of interview, the association between telephone measures and CDR-SOB was evaluated by multivariate regression. AQ scores were not affected by education, gender, and language of interview, but subject's age did show a positive correlation with informant AQ ratings. The AQ predicted CDR-SOB independently of the cognitive measures, adding variance above and beyond demographics. The TICS-m and the TEXAS appear to have additive value in improving the detection of cognitively impaired patients. The MIS-t failed to contribute significantly to CDR-SOB, independent of the other measures. The AQ may have utility as a culture-fair telephone screening for MCI. The AQ was able to modestly distinguish MCI from NCs. The TEXAS adds variance to a model of dementia severity independent of the AQ, suggesting that the latter may weakly assess that cognitive domain (executive control function). On the other hand, the AQ attenuates the MIS-t effect. This suggests a prominent AQ bias in favor of detecting memory impairment. Additional studies are required to determine if the AQ can distinguish between amnestic and dysexecutive MCI subtypes, or between MCI and Alzheimer's disease in Hispanics. 
24625007	The translocator protein as a drug target in Alzheimer's disease.
Expert Rev Neurother  2014Apr
The translocator protein (TSPO) recently emerged as a potential drug target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This has been fuelled mainly by positron emission topography studies that show the upregulation of TSPO in AD, especially in relation to microgliosis and astrogliosis in amyloid-Î² and tau pathology. Although data as to the exact role of TSPO in AD is still inconclusive, TSPO appears to be involved in neuroinflammatory processes and AD has been shown to involve substantial inflammation. Therefore, further development and investigation of the pharmacological effect of TSPO ligands in AD pathology are warranted.  
24679124	Signaling pathway cross talk in Alzheimer's disease.
Cell Commun. Signal 20140328 2014
Numerous studies suggest energy failure and accumulative intracellular waste play a causal role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in particular. AD is characterized by extracellular amyloid deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, cholinergic deficits, synaptic loss, inflammation and extensive oxidative stress. These pathobiological changes are accompanied by significant behavioral, motor, and cognitive impairment leading to accelerated mortality. Currently, the potential role of several metabolic pathways associated with AD, including Wnt signaling, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, silent mating-type information regulator 2 homolog 1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-Î± (PGC-1Î±) have widened, with recent discoveries that they are able to modulate several pathological events in AD. These include reduction of amyloid-Î² aggregation and inflammation, regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, and increased availability of neuronal energy. This review aims to highlight the involvement of these new set of signaling pathways, which we have collectively termed "anti-ageing pathways", for their potentiality in multi-target therapies against AD where cellular metabolic processes are severely impaired.  
23494944	Influence of the green tea leaf extract on neurotoxicity of aluminium chloride in rats.
Phytother Res 20130311 2014Jan
Aluminium may have an important role in the aetiology/pathogenesis/precipitation of Alzheimer's disease. Because green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) reportedly has health-promoting effects in the central nervous system, we evaluated the effects of green tea leaf extract (GTLE) on aluminium chloride (AlCl3 ) neurotoxicity in rats. All solutions were injected into the cornu ammonis region 1 hippocampal region. We measured the performance of active avoidance (AA) tasks, various enzyme activities and total glutathione content (TGC) in the forebrain cortex (FbC), striatum, basal forebrain (BFb), hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum. AlCl3 markedly reduced AA performance and activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in all regions. It decreased TGC in the FbC, striatum, BFb, hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum, and increased superoxide dismutase activity in the FbC, cerebellum and BFb. GTLE pretreatment completely reversed the damaging effects of AlCl3 on AA and superoxide dismutase activity, markedly corrected COX and AChE activities, and moderately improved TGC. GTLE alone increased COX and AChE activities in almost all regions. GTLE reduces AlCl3 neurotoxicity probably via antioxidative effects and improves mitochondrial and cholinergic synaptic functions through the actions of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and (-)-epicatechin, compounds most abundantly found in GTLE. Our results suggest that green tea might be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease. 
24252614	Inhibition of ERK-DLP1 signaling and mitochondrial division alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease cybrid cell.
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 20131116 2014Feb
Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying mechanisms and strategies to repair it remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the direct consequences and potential mechanisms of mitochondrial functional defects associated with abnormal mitochondrial dynamics in AD. Using cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) neurons with incorporated platelet mitochondria from AD and age-matched non-AD human subjects into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depleted neuronal cells, we observed that AD cybrid cells had significant changes in morphology and function; such changes associate with altered expression and distribution of dynamin-like protein (DLP1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2). Treatment with antioxidant protects against AD mitochondria-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and mitochondrial fission-fusion imbalances. Notably, inhibition of ERK activation not only attenuates aberrant mitochondrial morphology and function but also restores the mitochondrial fission and fusion balance. These effects suggest a role of oxidative stress-mediated ERK signal transduction in modulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion events. Further, blockade of the mitochondrial fission protein DLP1 by a genetic manipulation with a dominant negative DLP1 (DLP1(K38A)), its expression with siRNA-DLP1, or inhibition of mitochondrial division with mdivi-1 attenuates mitochondrial functional defects observed in AD cybrid cells. Our results provide new insights into mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from changes in the ERK-fission/fusion (DLP1) machinery and signaling pathway. The protective effect of mdivi-1 and inhibition of ERK signaling on maintenance of normal mitochondrial structure and function holds promise as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for AD.  
24416243	Characterization and molecular profiling of PSEN1 familial Alzheimer's disease iPSC-derived neural progenitors.
PLoS ONE 20140108 2014
Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) encodes the catalytic subunit of Î³-secretase, and PSEN1 mutations are the most common cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In order to elucidate pathways downstream of PSEN1, we characterized neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from FAD mutant PSEN1 subjects. Thus, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from affected and unaffected individuals from two families carrying PSEN1 mutations. PSEN1 mutant fibroblasts, and NPCs produced greater ratios of AÎ²42 to AÎ²40 relative to their control counterparts, with the elevated ratio even more apparent in PSEN1 NPCs than in fibroblasts. Molecular profiling identified 14 genes differentially-regulated in PSEN1 NPCs relative to control NPCs. Five of these targets showed differential expression in late onset AD/Intermediate AD pathology brains. Therefore, in our PSEN1 iPSC model, we have reconstituted an essential feature in the molecular pathogenesis of FAD, increased generation of AÎ²42/40, and have characterized novel expression changes.  
24352696	MicroRNA-339-5p down-regulates protein expression of Î²-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) in human primary brain cultures and is reduced in brain tissue specimens of Alzheimer disease subjects.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131218 2014Feb21
Alzheimer disease (AD) results, in part, from the excess accumulation of the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide as neuritic plaques in the brain. The short AÎ² peptide is derived from the large transmembrane AÎ² precursor protein (APP). The rate-limiting step in the production of AÎ² from APP is mediated by the Î²-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Dysregulation of BACE1 levels leading to excess AÎ² deposition is implicated in sporadic AD. Thus, elucidating the full complement of regulatory pathways that control BACE1 expression is key to identifying novel drug targets central to the AÎ²-generating process. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are expected to participate in this molecular network. Here, we identified a known miRNA, miR-339-5p, as a key contributor to this regulatory network. Two distinct miR-339-5p target sites were predicted in the BACE1 3'-UTR by in silico analyses. Co-transfection of miR-339-5p with a BACE1 3'-UTR reporter construct resulted in significant reduction in reporter expression. Mutation of both target sites eliminated this effect. Delivery of the miR-339-5p mimic also significantly inhibited expression of BACE1 protein in human glioblastoma cells and human primary brain cultures. Delivery of target protectors designed against the miR-339-5p BACE1 3'-UTR target sites in primary human brain cultures significantly elevated BACE1 expression. Finally, miR-339-5p levels were found to be significantly reduced in brain specimens isolated from AD patients as compared with age-matched controls. Therefore, miR-339-5p regulates BACE1 expression in human brain cells and is most likely dysregulated in at least a subset of AD patients making this miRNA a novel drug target.  
24487408	Synaptic abnormalities in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease.
Dis Model Mech 20140130 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and decreased synaptic function. Advances in transgenic animal models of AD have facilitated our understanding of this disorder, and have aided in the development, speed and efficiency of testing potential therapeutics. Recently, we have described the characterization of a novel model of AD in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, where we expressed the human AD-associated proteins APP and BACE in the central nervous system of the fly. Here we describe synaptic defects in the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in this model. Our results indicate that expression of human APP and BACE at the larval NMJ leads to defective larval locomotion behavior, decreased presynaptic connections, altered mitochondrial localization in presynaptic motor neurons and decreased postsynaptic protein levels. Treating larvae expressing APP and BACE with the Î³-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 suppresses the behavioral defects as well as the pre- and postsynaptic defects. We suggest that this model will be useful to assess and model the synaptic dysfunction normally associated with AD, and will also serve as a powerful in vivo tool for rapid testing of potential therapeutics for AD.  
24240735	The role of pro-inflammatory S100A9 in Alzheimer's disease amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade.
Acta Neuropathol. 20131116 2014Apr
Pro-inflammatory S100A9 protein is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to inflammation-related neurodegeneration. Here, we provide insights into S100A9 specific mechanisms of action in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to its inherent amyloidogenicity S100A9 contributes to amyloid plaque formation together with AÎ². In traumatic brain injury (TBI) S100A9 itself rapidly forms amyloid plaques, which were reactive with oligomer-specific antibodies, but not with AÎ² and amyloid fibrillar antibodies. They may serve as precursor-plaques for AD, implicating TBI as an AD risk factor. S100A9 was observed in some hippocampal and cortical neurons in TBI, AD and non-demented aging. In vitro S100A9 forms neurotoxic linear and annular amyloids resembling AÎ² protofilaments. S100A9 amyloid cytotoxicity and native S100A9 pro-inflammatory signaling can be mitigated by its co-aggregation with AÎ², which results in a variety of micron-scale amyloid complexes. NMR and molecular docking demonstrated transient interactions between native S100A9 and AÎ². Thus, abundantly present in AD brain pro-inflammatory S100A9, possessing also intrinsic amyloidogenic properties and ability to modulate AÎ² aggregation, can serve as a link between the AD amyloid and neuroinflammatory cascades and as a prospective therapeutic target.  
24304563	Upregulation of PGC-1Î± expression by Alzheimer's disease-associated pathway: presenilin 1/amyloid precursor protein (APP)/intracellular domain of APP.
Aging Cell 20131217 2014Apr
Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Î²- and Î³-secretase generates amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and APP intracellular domain (AICD) peptides. Presenilin (PS) 1 or 2 is the catalytic component of the Î³-secretase complex. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the causes and role of PS1, APP, and APP's cleavage products in this process are largely unknown. We studied the effect of these AD-associated molecules on mitochondrial features. Using cells deficient in PSs expression, expressing human wild-type PS1, or PS1 familial AD (FAD) mutants, we found that PS1 affects mitochondrial energy metabolism (ATP levels and oxygen consumption) and expression of mitochondrial proteins. These effects were associated with enhanced expression of the mitochondrial master transcriptional coactivator PGC-1Î± and its target genes. Importantly, PS1-FAD mutations decreased PS1's ability to enhance PGC-1Î± mRNA levels. Analyzing the effect of APP and its Î³-secretase-derived cleavage products AÎ² and AICD on PGC-1Î± expression showed that APP and AICD increase PGC-1Î± expression. Accordingly, PGC-1Î± mRNA levels in cells deficient in APP/APLP2 or expressing APP lacking its last 15 amino acids were lower than in control cells, and treatment with AICD, but not with AÎ², enhanced PGC-1Î± mRNA levels in these and PSs-deficient cells. In addition, knockdown of the AICD-binding partner Fe65 reduced PGC-1Î± mRNA levels. Importantly, APP/AICD increases PGC-1Î± expression also in the mice brain. Our results therefore suggest that APP processing regulates mitochondrial function and that impairments in the newly discovered PS1/APP/AICD/PGC-1Î± pathway may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.  
24341874	Modulation of p25 and inflammatory pathways by fisetin maintains cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.
Aging Cell 20131217 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. It is the only one of the top ten causes of death in the USA for which prevention strategies have not been developed. Although AD has traditionally been associated with the deposition of amyloid Î² plaques and tau tangles, it is becoming increasingly clear that it involves disruptions in multiple cellular systems. Therefore, it is unlikely that hitting a single target will result in significant benefits to patients with AD. An alternative approach is to identify molecules that have multiple biological activities that are relevant to the disease. Fisetin is a small, orally active molecule which can act on many of the target pathways implicated in AD. We show here that oral administration of fisetin to APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic AD mice from 3 to 12Â months of age prevents the development of learning and memory deficits. This correlates with an increase in ERK phosphorylation along with a decrease in protein carbonylation, a marker of oxidative stress. Importantly, fisetin also reduces the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activator p35 cleavage product, p25, in both control and AD brains. Elevated levels of p25 relative to p35 cause dysregulation of Cdk5 activity leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These fisetin-dependent changes correlate with additional anti-inflammatory effects, including alterations in global eicosanoid synthesis, and the maintenance of markers of synaptic function in the AD mice. Together, these results suggest that fisetin may provide a new approach to the treatment of AD.  
24363091	The proteasome function reporter GFPu accumulates in young brains of the APPswe/PS1dE9 Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 20131221 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is neuropathologically characterized by accumulation of insoluble fibrous inclusions in the brain in the form of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular senile plaques. Perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has long been considered an attractive hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of AD. However, studies on UPS functionality with various methods and AD models have achieved non-conclusive results. To get further insight into UPS functionality in AD, we have crossed a well-documented APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model with a UPS functionality reporter, GFPu, mouse expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused to a constitutive degradation signal (CL-1) that facilitates its rapid turnover in conditions of a normal UPS. Our western blot results indicate that GFPu reporter protein was accumulated in the cortex and hippocampus, but not striatum in the APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model at 4 weeks of age, which is confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and elevated levels of p53, an endogenous UPS substrate. In accordance with this, the levels of ubiquitinated proteins were elevated in the AD mouse model. These results suggest that UPS is either impaired or functionally insufficient in specific brain regions in the APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model at a very young age, long before senile plaque formation and the onset of memory loss. These observations may shed new light on the pathogenesis of AD. 
24442916	Methanolic extract of Piper nigrum fruits improves memory impairment by decreasing brain oxidative stress in amyloid beta(1-42) rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 20140119 2014Apr
The present study analyzed the possible memory-enhancing and antioxidant proprieties of the methanolic extract of Piper nigrum L. fruits (50 and 100 mg/kg, orally, for 21 days) in amyloid beta(1-42) rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The memory-enhancing effects of the plant extract were studied by means of in vivo (Y-maze and radial arm-maze tasks) approaches. Also, the antioxidant activity in the hippocampus was assessed using superoxide dismutase-, catalase-, glutathione peroxidase-specific activities and the total content of reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl levels. The amyloid beta(1-42)-treated rats exhibited the following: decrease of spontaneous alternations percentage within Y-maze task and increase of working memory and reference memory errors within radial arm-maze task. Administration of the plant extract significantly improved memory performance and exhibited antioxidant potential. Our results suggest that the plant extract ameliorates amyloid beta(1-42)-induced spatial memory impairment by attenuation of the oxidative stress in the rat hippocampus. 
24446209	Influence of APOE genotype and the presence of Alzheimer's pathology on synaptic membrane lipids of human brains.
J. Neurosci. Res. 20140121 2014May
The APOE genotype is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it remains unclarified how the Îµ4 allele accelerates whereas the Îµ2 allele suppresses AD development, compared with the more common Îµ3 allele. On the basis of the previous finding that the assembly of the amyloid-Î² protein (AÎ²) into fibrils in the brain, an early and invariable pathological feature of AD, depends on the lipid environment, we determined the levels of synaptic membrane lipids in aged individuals of different APOE genotypes. In the comparison between amyloid-free Îµ2/Îµ3 and Îµ3/Îµ3 brains, the presence of the Îµ2 allele significantly decreased the level of cholesterol. Alternatively, in the comparison among Îµ3/Îµ3 brains, the presence of AD pathology substantially decreased the levels of cholesterol. This study suggests that the Îµ2 allele suppresses the initiation of AD development by lowering the cholesterol levels in synaptic membranes. 
24193664	Loss of P2Yâ‚‚ nucleotide receptors enhances early pathology in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Neurobiol. 20131106 2014Apr
Neuroinflammation is a prominent feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and activation of the brain's innate immune system, particularly microglia, has been postulated to both retard and accelerate AD progression. Recent studies indicate that the G protein-coupled P2Y2 nucleotide receptor (P2Y2R) is an important regulator of innate immunity by assisting in the recruitment of monocytes to injured tissue, neutrophils to bacterial infections and eosinophils to allergen-infected lungs. In this study, we investigated the role of the P2Y2R in progression of an AD-like phenotype in the TgCRND8 mouse model that expresses Swedish and Indiana mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP). Our results indicate that P2Y 2 R expression is upregulated in TgCRND8 mouse brain within 10 weeks of age and then decreases after 25 weeks of age, as compared to littermate controls expressing low levels of the P2Y 2 R. TgCRND8 mice with homozygous P2Y 2 R deletion survive less than 5 weeks, whereas mice with heterozygous P2Y 2 R deletion survive for 12 weeks, a time point when TgCRND8 mice are fully viable. Heterozygous P2Y 2 R deletion in TgCRND8 mice increased Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaque load and soluble AÎ²1-42 levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, decreased the expression of the microglial marker CD11b in these brain regions and caused neurological deficits within 10 weeks of age, as compared to age-matched TgCRND8 mice. These findings suggest that the P2Y2R is important for the recruitment and activation of microglial cells in the TgCRND8 mouse brain and that the P2Y2R may regulate neuroprotective mechanisms through microglia-mediated clearance of AÎ² that when lost can accelerate the onset of an AD-like phenotype in the TgCRND8 mouse. 
24618820	Genetics of PICALM expression and Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140311 2014
Novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors have been identified by genome-wide association studies. Elucidating the mechanism underlying these factors is critical to the validation process and, by identifying rate-limiting steps in AD risk, may yield novel therapeutic targets. Here, we evaluated the association between the AD-associated polymorphism rs3851179 near PICALM, which encodes a clathrin-coated pit accessory protein. Immunostaining established that PICALM is expressed predominately in microvessels in human brain. Consistent with this finding, PICALM mRNA expression correlated with expression of the endothelial genes vWF and CD31. Additionally, we found that PICALM expression was modestly increased with the rs3851179A AD-protective allele. Analysis of PICALM isoforms found several isoforms lacking exons encoding elements previously identified as critical to PICALM function. Increased expression of the common isoform lacking exon 13 was also associated with the rs3851179A protective allele; this association was not apparent when this isoform was compared with total PICALM expression, indicating that the SNP is associated with total PICALM expression and not this isoform per se. Interestingly, PICALM lacking exons 2-4 was not associated with rs3851179 but was associated with rs592297, which is located in exon 5. Thus, our primary findings are that multiple PICALM isoforms are expressed in the human brain, that PICALM is robustly expressed in microvessels, and that expression of total PICALM is modestly correlated with the AD-associated SNP rs3851179. We interpret these results as suggesting that increased PICALM expression in the microvasculature may reduce AD risk.  
24659966	Imaging of cerebrovascular pathology in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140313 2014
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular pathology may interact with neurodegeneration and thus aggravate cognitive decline. As the relationship between these two processes is poorly understood, research has been increasingly focused on understanding the link between cerebrovascular alterations and AD. This has at last been spurred by the engineering of transgenic animals, which display pathological features of AD and develop cerebral amyloid angiopathy to various degrees. Transgenic models are versatile for investigating the role of amyloid deposition and vascular dysfunction, and for evaluating novel therapeutic concepts. In addition, research has benefited from the development of novel imaging techniques, which are capable of characterizing vascular pathology in vivo. They provide vascular structural read-outs and have the ability to assess the functional consequences of vascular dysfunction as well as to visualize and monitor the molecular processes underlying these pathological alterations. This article focusses on recent in vivo small animal imaging studies addressing vascular aspects related to AD. With the technical advances of imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance, nuclear and microscopic imaging, molecular, functional and structural information related to vascular pathology can now be visualized in vivo in small rodents. Imaging vascular and parenchymal amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposition as well as AÎ² transport pathways have been shown to be useful to characterize their dynamics and to elucidate their role in the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and AD. Structural and functional imaging read-outs have been employed to describe the deleterious affects of AÎ² on vessel morphology, hemodynamics and vascular integrity. More recent imaging studies have also addressed how inflammatory processes partake in the pathogenesis of the disease. Moreover, imaging can be pivotal in the search for novel therapies targeting the vasculature.  
24672452	Neural correlates of spatial navigation changes in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Front Behav Neurosci 20140317 2014
Although the memory impairment is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), AD has also been characterized by spatial disorientation, which is present from its early stages. Spatial disorientation in AD manifests itself in getting lost in familiar and unfamiliar places and have been characterized more specifically using spatial navigation tests in both real space and virtual environments as an impairment in multiple spatial abilities, including allocentric and egocentric navigation strategies, visuo-spatial perception, or selection of relevant information for successful navigation. Patients suffering mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at a high risk of development of dementia, show impairment in a subset of these abilities, mainly connected with allocentric and egocentric processing. While spatial disorientation in typical AD patients probably reflects neurodegenerative changes in medial and posterior temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, and retrosplenial cortex, the impairment of spatial navigation in MCI seem to be connected mainly with the medial temporal and also parietal brain changes. In this review, we will summarize the signs of brain disease in most MCI and AD patients showing in various tasks of spatial memory and navigation.  
24744700	Why looking at the whole hippocampus is not enough-a critical role for anteroposterior axis, subfield and activation analyses to enhance predictive value of hippocampal changes for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
Front Cell Neurosci 20140331 2014
The hippocampus is one of the earliest affected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its dysfunction is believed to underlie the core feature of the disease-memory impairment. Given that hippocampal volume is one of the best AD biomarkers, our review focuses on distinct subfields within the hippocampus, pinpointing regions that might enhance the predictive value of current diagnostic methods. Our review presents how changes in hippocampal volume, shape, symmetry and activation are reflected by cognitive impairment and how they are linked with neurogenesis alterations. Moreover, we revisit the functional differentiation along the anteroposterior longitudinal axis of the hippocampus and discuss its relevance for AD diagnosis. Finally, we indicate that apart from hippocampal subfield volumetry, the characteristic pattern of hippocampal hyperactivation associated with seizures and neurogenesis changes is another promising candidate for an early AD biomarker that could become also a target for early interventions.  
24418316	Simulations of monomeric amyloid Î²-peptide (1-40) with varying solution conditions and oxidation state of Met35: implications for aggregation.
Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 20140111 2014Mar1
The amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) is a 40-42 residue peptide that is the principal toxic species in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The oxidation of methionine-35 (Met35) to the sulfoxide form (Met35(ox)) has been identified as potential modulator of AÎ² aggregation. The role Met35(ox) plays in AÎ² neurotoxicity differs among experimental studies, which may be due to inconsistent solution conditions (pH, buffer, temperature). We applied atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a means to probe the dynamics of the monomeric 40-residue alloform of AÎ² (AÎ²40) containing Met35 or Met35(ox) in an effort to resolve the conflicting experimental results. We found that Met35 oxidation decreases the Î²-strand content of the C-terminal hydrophobic region (residues 29-40), with a specific effect on the secondary structure of residues 33-35, thus potentially impeding aggregation. Further, there is an important interplay between oxidation state and solution conditions, with pH and salt concentration augmenting the effects of oxidation. The results presented here serve to rationalize the conflicting results seen in experimental studies and provide a fundamental biophysical characterization of monomeric AÎ²40 dynamics in both reduced and oxidized forms, providing insight into the biochemical mechanism of AÎ²40 and oxidative stress related to AD.  
24508996	Distinction between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease by CSF amyloid Î²40 and Î²42, and protein-conjugated acrolein.
Clin. Chim. Acta 20140206 2014Mar20
We found previously that the amyloid Î²40/42 (AÎ²40/42) ratio and the level of protein-conjugated acrolein (PC-Acro) in plasma were increased in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. We determined whether MCI and AD subjects can be differentiated based on the levels of AÎ²40, AÎ²42, and PC-Acro in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). AÎ²40, AÎ²42, PC-Acro, Tau and phosphorylated Tau in CSF were measured by ELISA. Median values of AÎ²40, AÎ²40/PC-Acro and AÎ²40/42 in CSF were significantly lower in 54 AD subjects than those in 40 MCI subjects. Severity of VOI (volume of interest) atrophy was most intensely correlated with the decrease in AÎ²40/PC-Acro and then that in AÎ²40 and AÎ²42/PC-Acro. MMSE was most intensely correlated with the decrease in AÎ²42 and AÎ²40, and then that in AÎ²42/PC-Acro and AÎ²40/PC-Acro. A decrease in AÎ²40/PC-Acro in CSF is well correlated with brain damage, and a decrease in AÎ²42 and AÎ²40 is well correlated with cognitive ability. Measurement of PC-Acro together with AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 provides a more precise evaluation of severity of AD subjects. 
24412678	Decreased expression of CD33 in peripheral mononuclear cells of Alzheimer's disease patients.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140109 2014Mar20
Recently, two independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified CD33 gene, encoding cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33), as a genetic locus associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been suggested that CD33 may contribute to AD pathogenesis by involving in inflammatory response, synaptic dysfunction and cell membrane processes. We analyzed the expressions of CD33 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in AD group and control group by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Expression of CD33 mRNA was down-regulated in AD patients comparing to controls (p=0.001). The frequency of CD33 positive monocytes was also lower in AD patients than in controls (44.02 Â± 22.17% versus 54.06 Â± 21.86%, p=0.001). Moreover, we observed a correlation between CD33 positive monocytes levels and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r=0.220, p&lt;0.05). According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the diagnostic accuracy for CD33 alone is relatively lower, while, combining with additional parameters might further improve the diagnostic value for AD. 
24463336	Association of interleukin-4 genetic polymorphisms with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han population.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140124 2014Mar20
Cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to evaluate the potential association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-4 gene and AD susceptibility. This case-control study was conducted in Chinese Han populations consisting of 203 AD patients and 205 controls. Three common SNPs of IL-4 gene, including -590C&gt;T (rs2243250), -33C&gt;T (rs2070874), and -1098T&gt;G (rs2243248), were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and verified using DNA sequencing methods. Our data show that -590C and -1098G alleles of IL-4 were more common in AD patients (30.5% vs 22.2% p=0.007; 14.3% vs 3.4% p&lt;0.0001) and significantly associated with elevated risk for AD (OR=1.51 95% CI 1.05-2.23; OR=4.78 95% CI 2.37-7.67). Haplotype analysis revealed five common haplotypes CCG (OR=4.41), CCT (OR=1.22), TTT (OR=1.02), CTT (OR=0.7), and TCT (OR=0.14), from highest to lowest risk for AD. None of the associations appeared to be modified by APOE É›4 genetic variant. Bioinformatic analysis shows that -590C&gt;T and -1098T&gt;G have a linkage disequilibrium (LD) with multiple potentially functional SNPs inside IL-4 gene. Our findings indicate that the -590C and -1098G alleles located in the promoter of IL-4 may increase the susceptibility to AD among the Han Chinese and might be used as molecular markers for AD risk evaluation.  
24486888	The SORL1 polymorphism rs985421 may confer the risk for amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the Han Chinese population.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140129 2014Mar20
Although the pathogenetic mechanisms driving Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unclear, genetic variations may play an important role. Previous studies have identified that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the sortilin-related receptor, L (DLR class) A repeats containing (SORL1) gene are associated with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. However, the association of SORL1 variants with AD or aMCI susceptibility in the Han Chinese population has not been adequately reported. Thus, we conducted a case-control study in 106 sporadic AD patients, 67 aMCI patients, and 179 healthy control Han Chinese subjects to determine whether SORL1 genetic variations alter the risk for AD or aMCI. Using the LDR-PCR method to genotype five polymorphisms in SORL1, we found significant associations (for AD: OR=1.968, 95% CI=1.273-3.042; for aMCI: OR=2.210, 95% CI=1.353-3.610) between the 'A' allele of the SORL1 SNP rs985421 and AD and aMCI, which may represent an ApoE É›4-independent risk factor for SAD. These findings suggest that the SORL1 SNP rs985421 may alter the risk for sporadic AD and aMCI in the Han Chinese population.  
24495933	Clinical and molecular studies reveal a PSEN1 mutation (L153V) in a Peruvian family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Neurosci. Lett. 20140202 2014Mar20
Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene mutations are found in 30-70% of familial early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) cases (onset &lt;60 years). Prevalence of these mutations is highly variable including ethnic differences worldwide. No Peruvian kindred with familial AD (FAD) have been described. Standardized clinical evaluation and cognitive assessment were completed in a Peruvian family with severe EOAD. Clinical course was characterized by very early onset (before age 35 years), progressive cognitive impairment with early memory loss, spatial disorientation and executive dysfunction. We sequenced all exons of PSEN1 in the proband and identified a c.475C&gt;G DNA change resulting in a p.L153V missense mutation in the transmembrane domain 2 of the gene. This mutation is also present in the three additional affected siblings but not in a non-affected family member consistent with segregation of this mutation with the disease. This is the first report of a Peruvian family affected with EOAD associated with a PSEN1 mutation. This same mutation has been reported previously in English and French families, but a novel variants very close to the mutation and ancestry informative markers analysis suggests the mutation might be of Amerindian or African origin in this Peruvian family.  
24321892	Different adenosine A2A receptor expression in peripheral cells from elderly patients with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The line between vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often blurred. In this study we investigated whether adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) expression can be used to differentiate between VaD and AD. We evaluated the expression of this receptor in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with VaD, mild cognitive impairment, AD, and controls. We found statistically significant lower levels of A2AR mRNA in VaD compared to AD subjects. These data suggest that A2AR expression may help in the differential diagnosis between VaD and AD.  
24326515	Lateralized cortical involvement and contralateral parkinsonism without basal ganglia involvement in two autopsy cases of corticobasal syndrome-Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is characterized by lateralized motor disturbance due to levodopa nonresponsive parkinsonism and progressive apraxia. Although CBS is neuropathologically heterogeneous, it remains unclear whether the clinical features of all CBS cases are the same. We report two autopsy cases diagnosed clinically as CBS and pathologically as Alzheimer's disease characterized by lateralized cerebral cortical degeneration and absence of significant nigrostriatial lesions. Cerebral cortical degeneration in both cases was contralateral to their motor disturbances. Thus, nigrostriatial lesions and contralateral cerebral cortical lesions can cause motor disturbances in CBS, necessitating the need for bedside examination in patients with CBS.  
24326518	Natural history of functional decline in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Knowledge of functional evolution in dementia is crucial for the patients and their families as well as the clinician. This review identifies scales and outcomes used to describe the natural history of functional decline and describes the natural history of functional decline in a representative clinical population sample of published studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A search of three relevant databases was conducted and limited to articles published in English and French between 1998 to March 2012, using the keywords "Dementia", "Activities of Daily Living", "Instrumental Activities of Daily Living", "Functional Impairment", "Prognosis", and "Disease Progression". The search strategy displayed 683 articles, 20 of which were found to be related to the functional evolution of AD. In these studies, different scales were used to describe the evolution of the functional decline, except for the decline of instrumental activities, for which the Lawton scale was used in all studies. Thus, it is difficult to represent the evolution of the functional decline from a clinical point of view. Relatively little data are available to estimate the functional evolution of AD. A consensus with broadened thought is required to know if the progression of the incapacities in these scales is additive or hierarchical. 
24326520	Estrogen receptor Î² variants modify risk for Alzheimer's disease in a multiethnic female cohort.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Few studies of gene variants that affect estrogen activity investigate their association with age at onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women of different ethnicities. We investigated the influence of ESR2 polymorphisms on age at onset of AD in a multiethnic cohort of women. To determine whether gene variants would affect risk for AD differently in women of different population ancestries. Among 1,686 women participating in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), association with risk for AD was assessed for 20 ESR2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for age at time of study enrollment, presence of an APOE Îµ4 allele, years of education, and body mass index. Increased risk for AD was associated with four ESR2 SNPs in women of predominantly Caucasian AIMS-defined ancestry: rs944045, rs1256062, rs10144225, and rs2274705 (OR range 1.6-1.9, empiric p-value range 0.002-0.004). A separate SNP (rs10137185) was associated with decreased risk for AD in women who identified themselves as Black (OR 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-0.9). When vascular risk factors were included in the model, a separate SNP (rs1256059) was associated with increased risk for AD in women of admixed/Hispanic ancestry (OR 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.4). ESR2 polymorphisms affect risk for AD in women, and risk alleles vary by AIMs-defined ancestry and self-identified ethnicity. These effects are possibly due to different linkage disequilibrium patterns or differences in comorbid risk factors mediating SNP effect on risk for AD by group. 
24334722	Decrease of ERK/MAPK overactivation in prefrontal cortex reverses early memory deficit in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be considered as a disease of memory in its initial clinical stages. Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide accumulation is central to the disease initiation leading later to intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of cytoskeletal tau protein formation. It is under discussion whether different AÎ² levels of aggregation, concentration, brain area, and/or time of exposure might be critical to the disease progression, as well as which intracellular pathways it activates. The aim of the present work was to study memory-related early molecular and behavioral alterations in a mouse model of AD, in which a subtle deregulation of the physiologic function of AÎ² can be inferred. For this purpose we used triple-transgenic (3xTg) mice, which develop AÎ² and tau pathology resembling the disease progression in humans. Memory impairment in novel object recognition task was evident by 5 months of age in 3xTg mice. Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex extra-nuclear protein extracts developed differential patterns of AÎ² aggregation. ERK1/MAPK showed higher levels of cytosolic activity at 3 months and higher levels of nuclear activity at 6 months in the prefrontal cortex. No significant differences were found in JNK and NF-ÎºB activity and in calcineurin protein levels. Finally, intra-PFC administration of a MEK inhibitor in 6-month-old 3xTg mice was able to reverse memory impairment, suggesting that ERK pathway alterations might at least partially explain memory deficits observed in this model, likely as a consequence of memory trace disruption.  
24334723	Plasma amyloid-Î² levels are significantly associated with a transition toward Alzheimer's disease as measured by cognitive decline and change in neocortical amyloid burden.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
We evaluated the utility of longitudinal measures of plasma amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) as a means to identify pre-symptomatic cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) when coupled to neuroimaging and neuropsychological parameters. Participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were grouped based upon cognitive change and changes in measurable levels of neocortical amyloid over 36 months. Participants were classified as those who transitioned for cognitive decline and change in neocortical amyloid, those healthy controls that did not transition, and stable AD participants over 36 months. Comparisons of plasma AÎ² levels between the transition and non-transitional groups showed AÎ²1-42 and the AÎ²1-42/AÎ²1-40 ratio were significantly decreased at baseline (p = 0.008 and p = 0.002, respectively) and at 18 months (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively). Both measures of neocortical amyloid and two previously published composite scores validated the creation of the novel transitional grouping (p &lt; 0.0001). In addition AÎ²n-42 performed well as a longitudinal prognostic indicator of transition toward cognitive decline, with a significant decrease in the transition group at the 18 month time point (p = 0.01). We demonstrated that baseline plasma AÎ²1-42 and the AÎ²1-42/AÎ²1-40 ratio were putative biomarkers indicative of cognitive decline and validated this result using 18 month data. We created a novel transitional grouping and validated this measure using published measures of neocortical amyloid and composite memory scores. These findings suggest that longitudinal plasma AÎ² could contribute to a pre-symptomatic biomarker panel for AD. 
24334724	Neuron-specific alterations in signal transduction pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The hallmarks of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extracellular amyloid deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuronal death. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is a key factor in the generation of NFTs. Mitogen activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) and protein kinase C beta (PRKCB) are thought to play a role in hyperphosphorylation, and PRCKB is thought to be involved in hypoxic stress and vascular dysfunction, and to trigger MAPK phosphorylation pathways. We performed single-cell analyses of neurons with different vulnerabilities to AD-related changes. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we measured the levels of MAPK1 and PRKCB transcript in CA1 (high vulnerability), CA2 pyramidal cells from the hippocampus, granule cells from the cerebellum (low vulnerability), and neurons from the brain stem (nucleus tractus spinalis nervi trigemini, characterized by early neurophysiological deficits) at progressive Braak stages compared to age-matched controls. The highly vulnerable CA1 pyramidal neurons were characterized by age- and disease-unrelated increases in PRCKB levels and by age- and disease-related increases in MAPK1 levels. In contrast, low PRKCB levels were found in CA2 pyramidal neurons, and MAPK1 levels were elevated in controls and intermediate AD stages. Both PRKCB and MAPK1 were increased in the late AD stages. MAPK1 and PRKCB levels were low in the brainstem and cerebellum. We propose that alterations in the expression of these two genes occur early in the pathogenesis of AD in a region-specific manner. In addition, multiple signal transduction pathways need to be affected to result in AD instead of physiological aging.  
24346216	Activation of neuronal defense mechanisms in response to pathogenic factors triggering induction of amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
We present a new model for etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which postulates early involvement of specialized neuroprotective mechanisms in the pathology of AD. These neuroprotective mechanisms work in concert to regulate metabolic homeostasis in healthy neuronal cells, but contribute to the distinctive cytopathic phenotype of neuronal degeneration in AD. According to this model, two molecular/genetic hallmarks of AD, amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, are associated with neuronal mechanisms for dissipating thermal energy associated with high levels of protein synthesis in highly temperature-sensitive neuronal cells. Development of effective methods of AD treatment will require a better understanding of how this neuronal defense system is activated in response to cytopathological triggers in sporadic AD. The cause and effect link between synthesis and processing of amyloid-Î² protein precursor (AÎ²PP) and the AD terminal phenotype of neurofibrillary tangles and neuron loss involve the formation of AÎ² peptides that accumulate as oligomers, cannot be controlled by neurons, and are toxic to the surrounding neuronal membranes. We analyze experimental and clinical studies that have investigated the correlation between phosphorylation of some transport proteins and increased synthesis of proteins in neurons. We also review the evidence related to the possibility that protein hyperphosphorylation may be a byproduct of energetic imbalances in AD cells associated with high levels of protein synthesis, and that activation of defense systems, through which energy-rich molecules are eliminated from the site of protein synthesis and are sequestered to the peripheral neuronal areas, may bring about some of the distinctive morphological features of AD.  
24346218	Accuracy of urinary AD7c-NTP for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP) has been reported to have high diagnostic accuracy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of urinary AD7c-NTP for the diagnosis of AD in patients with suspected AD. We searched MEDLINE (January 1950 to date) and other electronic databases (from inception to date) for diagnostic accuracy studies that compared urinary AD7c-NTP to the standard clinical diagnosis of AD. We conducted citation searches and screened the reference lists of included studies. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using QUADAS. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall test performance. Nine studies met our inclusion criteria. The summary estimates of the urinary AD7c-NTP assay for probable or possible AD were as follows: SEN, 0.87 (95%CI: 0.80-0.91); SPE, 0.89 (95%CI: 0.87-0.91); PLR, 8.13 (95% CI: 6.60-10.02); and NLR, 0.15 (95% CI: 0.10-0.22). The four summary estimates of urinary AD7c-NTP assay for probable AD were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88-0.92), 8.88 (95% CI: 7.09-11.12), and 0.12 (95% CI: 0.09-0.16), with no obvious heterogeneity. Urinary AD7c-NTP is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of probable AD. However, whether urinary AD7c-NTP can be used as an early marker is still unknown. 
24413613	Optical and SPION-enhanced MR imaging shows that trans-stilbene inhibitors of NF-ÎºB concomitantly lower Alzheimer's disease plaque formation and microglial activation in AÎ²PP/PS-1 transgenic mouse brain.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a microglia-dependent neuroinflammatory response against plaques containing the fibrous protein amyloid-Î² (AÎ²). Activation of microglia, which closely associate with AÎ² plaques, engenders the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the internalization of AÎ² fibrils. Since the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-ÎºB is one of the major regulators of AÎ²-induced inflammation, we treated transgenic amyloid-Î² protein protein/presenilin-1 (AÎ²PP/PS1) mice for one year with a low dose (0.01% by weight in the diet) of either of two trans-stilbene NF-ÎºB inhibitors, resveratrol or a synthetic analog LD55. The 3D distribution of AÎ² plaques was measured ex vivo in intact brains at 60 Î¼m resolution by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using blood-brain barrier-permeable, anti-AÎ²PP-conjugated superparamagentic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The MRI measurements were confirmed by optical microscopy of thioflavin-stained brain tissue sections and indicated that supplementation with either of the two trans-stilbenes lowered AÎ² plaque density in the cortex, caudoputamen, and hippocampus by 1.4 to 2-fold. The optical measurements also included the hippocampus and indicated that resveratrol and LD55 reduced average AÎ² plaque density by 2.3-fold and 3.1-fold, respectively. Ex vivo measurements of the regional distribution of microglial activation by Iba-1 immunofluorescence of brain tissue sections showed that resveratrol and LD55 reduced average microglial activation by 4.2- fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. Since LD55 lacked hydroxyl groups but both resveratrol and LD55 concomitantly reduced both AÎ² plaque burden and neuroinflammation to a similar extent, it appears that the antioxidant potential of resveratrol is not an important factor in plaque reduction.  
24387791	Distribution of the hematopoietic growth factor G-CSF and its receptor in the adult human brain with specific reference to Alzheimer's disease.
J. Anat. 20140105 2014Apr
The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), being a member of the hematopoietic growth factor family, is also critically involved in controlling proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Treatment with G-CSF has been shown to result in substantial neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in various experimental models of acute and chronic diseases of the central nervous system. Although G-CSF has been tested in a clinical study for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, there is only fragmentary data on the distribution of this cytokine and its receptor in the human brain. Therefore, the present study was focused on the immunohistochemical analysis of the protein expression of G-CSF and its receptor (G-CSF R) in the adult human brain. Since G-CSF has been shown not only to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but also to be a candidate for clinical treatment, we have also placed an emphasis on the regulation of these molecules in this neurodegenerative disease. One major finding is that both G-CSF and G-CSF R were ubiquitously but not uniformly expressed in neurons throughout the CNS. Protein expression of G-CSF and G-CSF R was not restricted to neurons but was also detectable in astrocytes, ependymal cells, and choroid plexus cells. However, the distribution of G-CSF and G-CSF R did not substantially differ between AD brains and control, even in the hippocampus, where early neurodegenerative changes typically occur.  
24616592	Validity of the Korean version of the fear of Alzheimer's disease scale for the assessment of anticipatory dementia.
J. Korean Med. Sci. 20140227 2014Mar
Anticipatory dementia is related to anxiety, which is a clinical predictor of early conversion to Alzheimer's disease. The Fear of Alzheimer's Disease Scale (FADS) is a reliable and valid instrument to address anticipatory dementia. The aim of the present investigation was to develop the Korean version of the Fear of Alzheimer's Disease Scale (K-FADS) and to verify its reliability and validity. We developed the K-FADS to consist of 30 items with total scores ranging from 0 to 120, as in the original FADS. One hundred eight healthy volunteer participants, drawn from 3 different university hospitals, were evaluated. The K-FADS revealed good reliability (Cronbach Î±=0.96) and good validity as compared to the Korean version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form (r=0.242, P=0.013). Test-retest reliability was excellent, as the intra-class correlation coefficient comparing the retest to test was 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.99). Our results show that the K-FADS is a suitable and valuable scale to assess anticipatory dementia in elderly Koreans.  
24508404	Arginine metabolising enzymes as targets against Alzheimers' disease.
Neurochem. Int. 20140204 2014Feb
Even though the accumulation of arginine and the deposit of aggregated AÎ²-peptides (senile plaques) in the brain of an Alzheimer patient are classic points of evidence in the neuropathology of the disease considerable dispute remains on their method of formation. One acceptable mechanism to initiate events is a 'seed' aggregation of free monomeric peptides into toxic soluble amyloid oligomers and subsequently into deposits of insoluble fibrils. Since all of these events take place in the brain astrocytes it suggests an interference between arginine-metabolising enzymes and the AÎ²-peptides. Through kinetic, fluorimetric and thermodynamic analyses two such enzymes - neuronal nitric oxide synthase and peptidyl arginine deiminase - are, not only inhibited by structural fragments of AÎ²1-42 but are catalytic towards fibrillogenesis. The interaction of the peptide fragments with each enzyme is endothermic, non-spontaneous and involves hydrophobic-hydrophobic associations with a single binding site. The trigger for this series of events focusses in particularly on AÎ²17-21 with two phenylalanines [Phe19; Phe20], the three glycine zipper motifs [AÎ²25-29; AÎ²29-33; AÎ²33-37] and the triple sequence [AÎ²25-37] that includes two isoleucine residues [Ile31; Ile32]. FRET studies show the AÎ²-peptide fragments bind to the enzymes &lt;3.0nm from a single surface tryptophan. Free AÎ² monomers bind to an enzyme, formulate a nucleus, initiate their aggregation and subsequently become entrapped and couple to the existing aggregated monomers, leading to an elongated fibril. Silver and gold nanoparticles reverse fibrillogenesis! They are surrounded by the amyloid peptide molecules in vivo to effectively deplete their concentration. This does not allow any 'lag' time, nor prevent the formation of critical nuclei for the initial association phase and, inevitably, prevent fibril initiation and elongation. This review focusses on the function and action of arginine metabolising enzymes with respect to the formation of senile plaques and amyloid peptide aggregation to facilitate more of an understanding of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease. 
24614170	7,8-Dihydroxyflavone, a small molecule TrkB agonist, improves spatial memory and increases thin spine density in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease-like neuronal loss.
PLoS ONE 20140310 2014
Augmenting BDNF/TrkB signaling has been demonstrated to be a promising strategy for reversing cognitive deficits in preclinical models of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although these studies highlight the potential of targeting BDNF/TrkB signaling, this strategy has not yet been tested in a model that develops the disease features that are most closely associated with cognitive decline in AD: severe synaptic and neuronal loss. In the present study, we investigated the impact of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a TrkB agonist, in CaM/Tet-DTA mice, an inducible model of severe neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cortex. Systemic 7,8-DHF treatment significantly improved spatial memory in lesioned mice, as measured by water maze. Analysis of GFP-labeled neurons in CaM/Tet-DTA mice revealed that 7,8-DHF induced a significant and selective increase in the density of thin spines in CA1 of lesioned mice, without affecting mushroom or stubby spines. These findings suggest chronic upregulation of TrkB signaling with 7,8-DHF may be an effective and practical strategy for improving function in AD, even after substantial neuronal loss has occurred.  
24678637	Distinct transthyretin oxidation isoform profile in spinal fluid from patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
Clin Proteomics 20140329 2014
Transthyretin (TTR), an abundant protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), contains a free, oxidation-prone cysteine residue that gives rise to TTR isoforms. These isoforms may reflect conditions in vivo. Since increased oxidative stress has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) it is of interest to characterize CSF-TTR isoform distribution in AD patients and controls. Here, TTR isoforms are profiled directly from CSF by an optimized immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry method in 76 samples from patients with AD (n = 37), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 17)), and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH, n = 15), as well as healthy controls (HC, n = 7). Fractions of three specific oxidative modifications (S-cysteinylation, S-cysteinylglycinylation, and S-glutathionylation) were quantitated relative to the total TTR protein. Results were correlated with diagnostic information and with levels of CSF AD biomarkers tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid Î²1-42 peptide. Preliminary data highlighted the high risk of artifactual TTR modification due to ex vivo oxidation and thus the samples for this study were all collected using strict and uniform guidelines. The results show that TTR is significantly more modified on Cys(10) in the AD and MCI groups than in controls (NPH and HC) (p â‰¤ 0.0012). Furthermore, the NPH group, while having normal TTR isoform distribution, had significantly decreased amyloid Î² peptide but normal tau values. No obvious correlations between levels of routine CSF biomarkers for AD and the degree of TTR modification were found. AD and MCI patients display a significantly higher fraction of oxidatively modified TTR in CSF than the control groups of NPH patients and HC. Quantitation of CSF-TTR isoforms thus may provide diagnostic information in patients with dementia symptoms but this should be explored in larger studies including prospective studies of MCI patients. The development of methods for simple, robust, and reproducible inhibition of in vitro oxidation during CSF sampling and sample handling is highly warranted. In addition to the diagnostic information the possibility of using TTR as a CSF oxymeter is of potential value in studies monitoring disease activity and developing new drugs for neurodegenerative diseases. 
23567418	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and Alzheimer disease in the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 allele.
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130403 2014Feb
The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unclear, with conflicting results reported. We studied the interaction of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and ACE inhibitors on AD. This was a cross-sectional study of homebound elderly with an AD diagnosis and documentation of medications taken. ApoE genotype was determined. A total of 355 subjects with status on ApoE alleles and cognitive diagnoses were studied. The average age (mean Â± SD) of this population was 73.3 Â± 8.3 years old, and 73% were female. Cross-sectionally, there was no difference in the number of AD cases between ApoE4 carriers and ApoE4 non-carriers or between ACE inhibitor users and non-users in the homebound elderly. ApoE4 carriers treated with ACE inhibitors, however, had more diagnoses of AD compared with those who did not have the treatment (28% versus 6%, pÂ = 0.01) or ApoE4 non-carriers treated with an ACE inhibitor (28% versus 10%, pÂ = 0.03). ACE inhibitor use was associated with AD diagnosis only in the presence of an E4 allele. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that in diagnosed AD cases there was a significant interaction between ApoE4 and ACE inhibitor use (odds ratio: 20.85; 95% confidence interval: 3.08-140.95; pÂ = 0.002) after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and education. The effects of ACE inhibitors on AD may be different depending on ApoE genotype. A prospective study is needed to determine whether ACE inhibitor use accelerates or poorly delays AD development in ApoE4 carriers compared with ApoE4 non-carriers. 
24566512	Cognitive subdomain responses to galantamine in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Nerv. Ment. Dis.  2014Mar
We investigated the effects of galantamine on cognitive subdomains in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sixty-six patients with mild-to-moderate AD received open-label galantamine for 52 weeks. Cognitive function was measured using the Korean version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog-K). Response to galantamine was defined as "improvement or no deterioration" on the total scores of the ADAS-cog-K at 26 weeks. In the overall intent-to-treat sample, we found less cognitive decline during 26 and 52 weeks than the expected untreated course as predicted by Stern's equation. The operationally defined response rate at 26 weeks was 66.7%. The responders differed significantly from the nonresponders only in the memory and language domains but not in the domains of praxis or frontal/executive function or in secondary outcome measures of neuropsychiatric symptoms and activities of daily living. The subdomain analysis revealed an effect of galantamine on preservation of memory that was not apparent in the overall analysis. Failure to achieve responder status by 26 weeks was associated with no further possibility of response.  
24508831	Synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular modeling study of novel tacrine-carbazole hybrids as potential multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140122 2014Mar21
New tacrine-carbazole hybrids were developed as potential multifunctional anti-Alzheimer agents for their cholinesterase inhibitory and radical scavenging activities. The developed compounds showed high inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with IC50 values ranging from 0.48 to 1.03 Î¼M and exhibited good inhibition selectivity against AChE over butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Molecular modeling studies revealed that these tacrine-carbazole hybrids interacted simultaneously with the catalytic active site (CAS) and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The derivatives containing methoxy group showed potent ABTS radical scavenging activity. Considering their neuroprotection, our results indicate that these derivatives can reduce neuronal death induced by oxidative stress and Î²-amyloid (AÎ²). Moreover, S1, the highest potency for both radical scavenging and AChE inhibitory activity, exhibited an ability to improve both short-term and long-term memory deficit in mice induced by scopolamine. Overall, tacrine-carbazole derivatives can be considered as a candidate with potential impact for further pharmacological development in Alzheimer's therapy. 
24530494	Design, synthesis, pharmacological evaluation, QSAR analysis, molecular modeling and ADMET of novel donepezil-indolyl hybrids as multipotent cholinesterase/monoamine oxidase inhibitors for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140127 2014Mar21
The design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of donepezil-indolyl based amines 7-10, amides 12-16, and carboxylic acid derivatives 5 and 11, as multipotent ASS234 analogs, able to inhibit simultaneously cholinesterase (ChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is reported. Theoretical studies using 3D-Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (3D-QSAR) was used to define 3D-pharmacophores for inhibition of MAO A/B, AChE, and BuChE enzymes. We found that, in general, and for the same substituent, amines are more potent ChE inhibitors (see compounds 12, 13 versus 7 and 8) or equipotent (see compounds 14, 15 versus 9 and 10) than the corresponding amides, showing a clear EeAChE inhibition selectivity. For the MAO inhibition, amides were not active, and among the amines, compound 14 was totally MAO A selective, while amines 15 and 16 were quite MAO A selective. Carboxylic acid derivatives 5 and 11 showed a multipotent moderate selective profile as EeACE and MAO A inhibitors. Propargylamine 15 [N-((5-(3-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)propoxy)-1-methyl-1H-indol-2-yl)methyl)prop-2-yn-1-amine] resulted in the most potent hMAO A (IC50 = 5.5 Â± 1.4 nM) and moderately potent hMAO B (IC50 = 150 Â± 31 nM), EeAChE (IC50 = 190 Â± 10 nM), and eqBuChE (IC50 = 830 Â± 160 nM) inhibitor. However, the analogous N-allyl and the N-morpholine derivatives 16 and 14 deserve also attention as they show an attractive multipotent profile. To sum up, donepezil-indolyl hybrid 15 is a promising drug for further development for the potential prevention and treatment of AD. 
24456283	A brief report on the efficacy of donepezil in pain management in Alzheimer's disease.
J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother 20140123 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease is an advanced dementia. In this disease, little by little the brain loses most of its functions. Pain is a prevalent complaint. It seems easing the pain had the better recovery to antipsychotic drug in controlling agitation in dementia patients. Donepezil is a drug that is used to treat Alzheimer's disease. This brief report describes an 83-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease who experienced boredom and changes in attitude for about 1 year and complained about general pain in her extremity. Starting donepezil controlled the patient's symptoms. As soon as the treatment started, all pain was dramatically eliminated and her behavior improved. Donepezil may be effective in controlling the pain and improve the outcome of these patients. 
24665599	[The pathogenetic rationale for the application of reflexotherapy in the rehabilitation of the patients presenting with cognitive disorders].
Vopr Kurortol Fizioter Lech Fiz Kult  2014 Jan-Feb
Cognitive disorders (CD) of variable severity are currently one of the leading causes of disability in the patients presenting with vascular and degenerative diseases of the brain; it is especially true of Alzheimer's disease. The discovery of the universal pathogenetic mechanism underlying the development of CD made it possible to explain the known cases of the successful application of acupuncture in the patients with disorders of seemingly different origin. The results of these studies suggest that acupuncture can affect the key pathogenetic "functional circles" involved in the development of CD. The present article is focused on the description of the humoral, neurotransmitter and electrophysiological mechanisms through which the positive effects of acupuncture on the cognitive function of the patients with various diseases are mediated. 
24734059	Synthesis of brominated 2-phenitidine derivatives as valuable inhibitors of cholinesterases for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Iran J Pharm Res  2014Winter
The present study reports the synthesis of a series N-substituted derivatives of brominated 2-phenitidine. First, the reaction of 2-phenitidine (1) with benzenesulfonyl chloride (2) in aqueous media yielded N-(2-ethoxyphenyl) benzenesulfonamide (3), which was then subjected to bromination with bromine in the presence of glacial acetic acid to give N-(4,5-dibromo-2-ethoxyphenyl) benzenesulfonamide (4). Secondly, the product (4) on further treatment with alkyl/aryl halides (5a-l) in the presence of lithium hydride (LiH) produced twelve new derivatives of N-substituted sulfonamides (6a-l). These were characterized by (1)H-NMR spectrum and screened against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and lipoxygenase (LOX) and were found to be valuable inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Few of them were also active against LOX.  
24466171	CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-Î² expression and elevation in Alzheimer's disease and microglial cell cultures.
PLoS ONE 20140122 2014
CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins are transcription factors that help to regulate a wide range of inflammatory mediators, as well as several key elements of energy metabolism. Because C/EBPs are expressed by rodent astrocytes and microglia, and because they are induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines that are chronically upregulated in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cortex, we have investigated whether C/EBPs are expressed and upregulated in the AD cortex. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that C/EBPÎ² can be detected by Western blots in AD and nondemented elderly (ND) cortex, and that it is significantly increased in AD cortical samples. In situ, C/EBPÎ² localizes immunohistochemically to microglia. In microglia cultured from rapid autopsies of elderly patient's brains and in the BV-2 murine microglia cell line, we have shown that C/EBPÎ² can be upregulated by C/EBP-inducing cytokines or lipopolysaccharide and exhibits nuclear translocation possibly indicating functional activity. Given the known co-regulatory role of C/EBPs in pivotal inflammatory mechanisms, many of which are present in AD, we propose that upregulation of C/EBPs in the AD brain could be an important orchestrator of pathogenic changes.  
24293237	Proteome characterization of splenocytes from an AÎ²pp/ps-1 Alzheimer's disease model.
Proteomics 20140106 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of US deaths. In addition to neurodegenerative deficits in AD, changes in the immune system have also been observed. Proteomic analysis of specific immune cell populations may help gain insights into mechanisms of peripheral immunity in AD. Herein, we report proteome characterization for two subsets of splenocytes (i.e. CD90+ cells and a heterogeneous pool of CD90- cells) from a double transgenic mutant amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (AÎ²pp/ps-1) AD mouse model. Overall, 906 proteins were identified from both cell types with 275 and 334 proteins uniquely identified as CD90+ and CD90- cells, respectively. Proteins identified in CD90+ and CD90- cells were significantly involved in 18 and 19 KEGG pathways, respectively. Amongst these, pathways associated with AD and antigen processing and presentation were identified in CD90+ and CD90- subsets, respectively. This is the first study to provide a reference proteome map for splenocyte populations in AÎ²pp/ps-1 double transgenic mice which will be helpful for future studies focused on understanding peripheral changes in this model. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000203 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD000203).  
24598931	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of the Fab portion of the Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy candidate bapineuzumab complexed with amyloid-Î².
Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun 20140220 2014Mar
Bapineuzumab (AAB-001) and its derivative (AAB-003) are humanized versions of the anti-AÎ² murine antibody 3D6 and are immunotherapy candidates in Alzheimer's disease. The common Fab fragment of these immunotherapies has been expressed, purified and crystallized in complex with Î²-amyloid peptides (residues 1-8 and 1-28). Diffraction data at high resolution were acquired from crystals of Fab-AÎ²8 (2.0â€…Ã…) and Fab-AÎ²28 (2.2â€…Ã…) complexes at the Australian Synchrotron. Both crystal forms belonged to the primitive orthorhombic space group P21221.  
23943275	Time until nursing home admission in people with mild dementia: comparison of dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's dementia.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130813 2014Apr
We studied time until nursing home admission (NHA) in mild dementia and predictors for NHA in people with Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and how it compares to Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards were applied. Median time until NHA was 1114â€‰days (95% confidence interval [CI] [932, 1296]). In DLB median time until NHA was 663â€‰days [472, 998]) as compared with 1336 days (1068, 1606) in AD, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0005. Predictors of shorter time to NHA in the DLB and AD groups in unadjusted analyses were a DLB diagnosis, the use of antipsychotic medication, more advanced age, longer duration of dementia symptoms prior to diagnosis, living alone, higher reported caregiver distress, and more neuropsychiatric symptoms. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors was associated with halved risk of NHA in the combined DLB/AD group in the unadjusted Cox regression. In adjusted Cox regression in the DLB group, we found the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to be associated with reduced risk of NHA (HRâ€‰=â€‰0.24) and the use of antipsychotic medication to be associated with increased risk of NHA (HRâ€‰=â€‰37) during the study period. Patients diagnosed with DLB had nearly 2â€‰ years shorter time to NHA than those diagnosed with AD. In the DLB group, the use of cholinesterase inhibitors was associated with reduced and the use of antipsychotics with increased risk of NHA. Future studies should explore whether better identification and management of the variety of clinical problems in patients diagnosed with DLB can delay NHA. 
23970375	Platelet a disintegrin and metallopeptidase 10 expression correlates with clock drawing test scores in Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130822 2014Apr
Earlier studies have demonstrated that a disintegrin and metallopeptidase 10 (ADAM10) levels are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared with healthy subjects. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether platelet ADAM10 levels correlates with the clock drawing test (CDT) scores, which is a simple and a reliable measure of visuospatial ability and executive function in AD patients. Thirty elderly patients with probable AD and 25 healthy patients forming the control group, matched by age, gender, and educational level, were evaluated. Platelet proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ADAM10 was identified by western blotting. The Spearman's correlation coefficient between ADAM10 and CDT was obtained for each group. The areas under the curves were used to compare the receiver operating characteristic curves. The CDT scores and platelet ADAM10 expression were significantly different between patients with AD and controls and also along the disease's progression. In AD patients, there was a positive correlation between ADAM10 expression and CDT scores. Among non-AD subjects, no correlation was found. The combination of ADAM10 and CDT was significantly better to confirm the AD diagnosis than the AUCs of ADAM10 and CDT separately. The association of blood-based biomarkers, such as ADAM10, and cognitive tests may be helpful for a more reliable AD diagnosis. 
23919560	Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: an understanding of physiology and pathology.
Int. J. Neurosci. 20130912 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastative neurodegenerative disorder with complex etiology. Neuroinflammation has been found to be an underlying cause of the disease, although it demonstrates significant defensive role and renders the brain immunologically secured. This review focuses on the physiology and pathology of this crucial biological process and the diverse factors involved in and acting in a concerted manner to play a pivotal role either in the physiology or pathology of the disease. We used Pubmed, Pubmed Central, and Medline databases for a period of 3 months. It also summarizes the recent advances in neuroinflammation in both in vitro and in vivo. This review eventually warrants further studies on animal models of AD to unravel the complete pathophysiology of the disease and also accentuates the burgeoning need to protect astrocytes which can become a substantial therapeutic avenue.  
23931049	Postoperative cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease, and anesthesia.
Int. J. Neurosci. 20130927 2014Apr
Although aging itself is not a disease, there are many comorbidities that become more common with aging. Heart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses are either more common or more severe in aging patients. Approximately 5.5 million people in the United States have Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the principal risk factor being age. It is estimated that the incidence of AD diagnosis doubles every 5 years after the age of 65. Therefore, as the population ages, the impact of AD on the healthcare landscape will increase. Understanding how to manage patients with AD is critical as we begin to care for more elderly patients in the perioperative period. In addition to their other health considerations, aging surgical patients are increasingly more likely to have pre-existing AD or be at risk for developing AD. There is growing interest to determine how anesthesia affects the development or progression of AD. Similarly, a best practice for the anesthetic management of patients with AD is not yet defined. Finally, the relationship between AD and susceptibility to or exacerbation of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is not well understood. In this review, we will discuss both the clinical and the preclinical data related to anesthesia and AD, describe the overlapping pathophysiology of neurodegeneration and provide some insight into the anesthetic care of patients with AD. 
23952620	Association between Alzheimer's disease and the NOS3 gene Glu298Asp polymorphism.
Int. J. Neurosci. 20130923 2014Apr
The Glu298Asp gene polymorphism in NOS3 gene has been extensively investigated for association to Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, results of different studies have been inconsistent. The objective of this study is to assess the relationship of NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism and AD risk by using meta-analysis. All eligible case-control studies were searched in PubMed and Embase. Odds ratios (OR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the association. A total of 5522 cases and 4877 controls in 20 case-control studies were included. Obvious heterogeneity among studies was detected, and no significant association was observed between the NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism and AD risk. After exclusion of three studies, the heterogeneity disappeared and still no association was observed. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we did not find any significant association between this polymorphism and AD risk in both Asians and Caucasians. This meta-analysis suggested that the NOS3 Glu298Asp gene polymorphism is not a strong risk factor for AD. To further evaluate gene-to-gene and gene-to-environmental interactions between polymorphisms of NOS3 gene and AD risk, more studies with large groups of patients are required. 
24332770	Do Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) progress differently?
Arch Gerontol Geriatr 20131122 2014 May-Jun
Our study aimed to compare cognitive status and declines in AD with/without small vessel disease (SVD) and SIVD at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Patients with Alzheimer's disease without small vessel disease (AD(-)SVD) (n=148), Alzheimer's disease with small vessel disease (AD(+)SVD) (n=94) and SIVD (n=60) were recruited from database of multiple centers in Korea. Basic demographics and detailed neuropsychological results were compared. AD, regardless of SVD, showed worse memory and better executive function than SIVD at baseline. Mini-Mental State Examination scores and visual memory function declined more in AD than those in SIVD whereas Barthel Activities of Daily Living (B-ADL) scores declined more in SIVD. AD showed different patterns of cognitive impairment compared with SIVD. After 1 year, AD showed more rapid cognitive decline in some domains. Further investigations with longer follow-up duration may be needed to confirm the cumulative effects of SVD in AD and different patterns of decline between AD and SIVD.  
24729933	Susceptibility to focal and global brain ischemia of Alzheimer mice displaying aÎ² deposits: effect of immunoglobulin.
Aging Dis 20140401 2014Apr
Cerebral ischemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that it is a two-way street as the incidence rate of stroke is significantly higher in AD patients than those without the disease. Here we investigated the interaction of ischemic brain insults and AD in 9-month-old ApdE9 mice, which show full-blown accumulation of AÎ² deposits and microgliosis in the brain. Permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (pMCAo) resulted in 36% larger infarct in ApdE9 mice compared to their wild-type (wt) controls. This was not due to differences in endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity. Treatment with human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) reduced the infarct volumes and abolished the increased vulnerability of ApdE9 mice to pMCAo induced brain ischemia. When the mice were exposed to global brain ischemia (GI), an insult of hippocampal cells, ApdE9 mice showed increased neuronal loss in CA2 and CA3 subregions compared to their wt controls. GI was associated with increased microgliosis, astrogliosis, infiltration of blood-derived monocytic cells, and neurogenesis without clear differences between the genotypes. IVIG treatment prevented the GI-induced neuron loss in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions in ApdE9 mice. IVIG treatment increased microgliosis in wt but not in ApdE9 mice. Finally, GI induced 60% reduction in the hippocampal AÎ² burden in ApdE9 mice, which was not affected by IVIG treatment. The results indicate that the AD pathology with AÎ² deposits and microgliosis increases ischemic vulnerability in various brain areas. Moreover, IVIG treatment may be beneficial especially in patients suffering from both acute ischemic insult and AD.  
24466084	Comparison of medial temporal measures between Binswanger's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140123 2014
Binswanger's disease (BD) is a common cause of vascular dementia in elderly patients; however, few studies have investigated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy in BD, and the differences in the atrophic patterns between BD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely unknown. Such knowledge is essential for understanding the pathologic basis of dementia. In this study, we collected structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 16 normal controls, 14 patients with AD and 14 patients with BD. The volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala, and morphologic parameters (volume, surface area, cortical thickness and mean curvature) of the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC) were calculated using an automated approach. Volume reduction of the hippocampus, amygdala and ERC, and disturbance of the PRC curvature was found in both AD and BD patients compared with the controls (p&lt;0.05, uncorrected). There were no significant differences among all the structural measures between the AD and BD patients. Finally, partial correlation analyses revealed that cognitive decline could be attributed to ERC thinning in AD and volume reduction of PRC in BD. We conclude that AD and BD exhibit similar atrophy patterns in the medial temporal cortices and deep gray matter but have distinct pathologic bases for cognitive impairments. Although atrophy of the MTL structures is a sensitive biomarker for AD, it is not superior for discrimination between AD and BD.  
24029627	Prefibrillar tau oligomers in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Neurodegener Dis 20130911 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-Î² peptide and intracellular tau. Here, we review data suggesting that prefibrillar tau oligomers mediate cognitive decline early in the disease. It was our aim to study the presence of tau-positive pretangle neurons and correlate findings with cognitive test scores. Pretangle antibodies (TOC1 and pS422) were applied to tissue containing cholinergic basal forebrain neurons from people who died with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment and AD. Data lend support to the concept that tau oligomers are the toxic form of tau, that non-fibillar tau relates to cognitive dysfunction and that the earliest pretangle pathology occurs in neuritic processes. Clinicopathological findings highlight the importance of studying tau modifications in neuronal soma and neuritic processes, which may be the earliest pathological lesions that correlate with cognitive status. 
23684446	From high doses of oral rivastigmine to transdermal rivastigmine patches: user experience and satisfaction among caregivers of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.
Neurologia 20130517 2014Mar
Rivastigmine, a treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD), is the first cholinesterase inhibitor to be available in the transdermal format. We aim to describe user experience and satisfaction with the rivastigmine patch, as well as any clinical changes perceived in patients. Observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study with 239 investigators and 1851 informal caregivers of patients with mild to moderate AD. Patients were treated with transdermal rivastigmine patches forÂ â‰¥Â 6 months and had previously received high doses of oral rivastigmine. Mean caregiver age was 59.8Â±14.4 years and 70.9% were women. They spent 10.0Â±7.1hours per day providing care and 79.8% lived with the patient. Patch instructions were described as easy to follow by 97.1% of the caregivers and 92.1% of them rated patch application as easy or very easy. The most commonly cited disadvantage was adhesion problems (26.8%). Discontinuation of treatment was due to cutaneous reactions in most cases. Overall, 76.5% of the caregivers were satisfied or very satisfied with transdermal treatment and 77.4% considered that its interference with daily activities was minimal or null. The patch was preferred to oral treatment by 94.3% of caregivers. Clinical Global Impression of Change ratings improved according to 61.3% of the caregivers and 53% of the investigators. Few caregivers reported medication forgetfulness. Most caregivers of patients with mild to moderate AD preferred the transdermal format of rivastigmine to the oral format. Caregivers also reported overall satisfaction, ease of use, and reduced impact on daily activities for transdermal rivastigmine format, in addition to patient improvement compared to their condition under the previous treatment. 
24595028	Longitudinal grey and white matter changes in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140303 2014
Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia are characterised by progressive brain atrophy. Longitudinal MRI volumetry may help to characterise ongoing structural degeneration and support the differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes. Automated, observer-independent atlas-based MRI volumetry was applied to analyse 102 MRI data sets from 15 bvFTD, 14 AD, and 10 healthy elderly control participants with consecutive scans over at least 12 months. Anatomically defined targets were chosen a priori as brain structures of interest. Groups were compared regarding volumes at clinic presentation and annual change rates. Baseline volumes, especially of grey matter compartments, were significantly reduced in bvFTD and AD patients. Grey matter volumes of the caudate and the gyrus rectus were significantly smaller in bvFTD than AD. The bvFTD group could be separated from AD on the basis of caudate volume with high accuracy (79% cases correct). Annual volume decline was markedly larger in bvFTD and AD than controls, predominantly in white matter of temporal structures. Decline in grey matter volume of the lateral orbitofrontal gyrus separated bvFTD from AD and controls. Automated longitudinal MRI volumetry discriminates bvFTD from AD. In particular, greater reduction of orbitofrontal grey matter and temporal white matter structures after 12 months is indicative of bvFTD.  
24665147	Serum anticholinergic activity: a possible peripheral marker of the anticholinergic burden in the central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease.
Dis. Markers 20140209 2014
We review the utility of serum anticholinergic activity (SAA) as a peripheral marker of anticholinergic activity (AA) in the central nervous system (CAA). We hypothesize that the compensatory mechanisms of the cholinergic system do not contribute to SAA if their system is intact and that if central cholinergic system deteriorates alone in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or Lewy body dementia, CAA and SAA are caused by way of hyperactivity of inflammatory system and SAA is a marker of the anticholinergic burden in CNS. Taking into account the diurnal variations in the plasma levels of corticosteroids, which are thought to affect SAA, it should be measured at noon or just afterward.  
24688166	Promise and challenge: the lens model as a biomarker for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
Dis. Markers 20140212 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia pathologically characterized by cerebral amyloid-beta (AÎ²) deposition. Early and accurate diagnosis of the disease still remains a big challenge. There is evidence that AÎ² aggregation starts to occur years before symptoms arise. Noninvasive monitoring of AÎ² plaques is critical for both the early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. Presently, there is a major effort on looking for a reasonably priced technology capable of diagnosing AD by detecting the presence of AÎ². Studies suggest that AD is systemic rather than brain-limited focus diseases and the aggregation of the disease-causing proteins also takes place in lens except the brain. There is a possible relationship between AD and a specific subtype of age-related cataract (supranuclear cataract). If similar abnormal protein deposits are present in the lens, it would facilitate non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. However, there are controversies on the issues related to performance and validation of AÎ² deposition in lens as biomarkers for early detection of AD. Here we review the recent findings concerning AÎ² deposition in the lenses of AD patients and evaluate if the ocular lens can provide a biomarker for AD.  
24392696	Emerging therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.
Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.  2014
Despite decades of intense research, therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still limited to symptomatic treatments that possess only short-term efficacy. Recently, several large-scale Phase III trials targeting amyloid-Î² production or clearance have failed to show efficacy, leading to a reexamination of the amyloid hypothesis as well as highlighting the need to explore alternatives in both clinical testing strategies and drug discovery targets. In this review, we discuss therapeutics currently being tested in clinical trials and up-and-coming interventions that have shown promise in animal models, devoting attention to the mechanisms that may underlie their ability to influence disease progression and placing particular emphasis on tau therapeutics. 
24378989	Alzheimer's disease and CADASIL are heritable, adult-onset dementias that both involve damaged small blood vessels.
Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 20131231 2014Mar
This essay explores an alternative pathway to Alzheimer's dementia that focuses on damage to small blood vessels rather than late-stage toxic amyloid deposits as the primary pathogenic mechanism that leads to irreversible dementia. While the end-stage pathology of AD is well known, the pathogenic processes that lead to disease are often assumed to be due to toxic amyloid peptides that act on neurons, leading to neuronal dysfunction and eventually neuronal cell death. Speculations as to what initiates the pathogenic cascade have included toxic abeta peptide aggregates, oxidative damage, and inflammation, but none explain why neurons die. Recent high-resolution NMR studies of living patients show that lesions in white matter regions of the brain precede the appearance of amyloid deposits and are correlated with damaged small blood vessels. To appreciate the pathogenic potential of damaged small blood vessels in the brain, it is useful to consider the clinical course and the pathogenesis of CADASIL, a heritable arteriopathy that leads to damaged small blood vessels and irreversible dementia. CADASIL is strikingly similar to early onset AD in that it is caused by germ line mutations in NOTCH 3 that generate toxic protein aggregates similar to those attributed to mutant forms of the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin genes. Since NOTCH 3 mutants clearly damage small blood vessels of white matter regions of the brain that lead to dementia, we speculate that both forms of dementia may have a similar pathogenesis, which is to cause ischemic damage by blocking blood flow or by impeding the removal of toxic protein aggregates by retrograde vascular clearance mechanisms.  
24497505	Transcriptome analysis of distinct mouse strains reveals kinesin light chain-1 splicing as an amyloid-Î² accumulation modifier.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 20140204 2014Feb18
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²). The genes that govern this process, however, have remained elusive. To this end, we combined distinct mouse strains with transcriptomics to directly identify disease-relevant genes. We show that AD model mice (APP-Tg) with DBA/2 genetic backgrounds have significantly lower levels of AÎ² accumulation compared with SJL and C57BL/6 mice. We then applied brain transcriptomics to reveal the genes in DBA/2 that suppress AÎ² accumulation. To avoid detecting secondarily affected genes by AÎ², we used non-Tg mice in the absence of AÎ² pathology and selected candidate genes differently expressed in DBA/2 mice. Additional transcriptome analysis of APP-Tg mice with mixed genetic backgrounds revealed kinesin light chain-1 (Klc1) as an AÎ² modifier, indicating a role for intracellular trafficking in AÎ² accumulation. AÎ² levels correlated with the expression levels of Klc1 splice variant E and the genotype of Klc1 in these APP-Tg mice. In humans, the expression levels of KLC1 variant E in brain and lymphocyte were significantly higher in AD patients compared with unaffected individuals. Finally, functional analysis using neuroblastoma cells showed that overexpression or knockdown of KLC1 variant E increases or decreases the production of AÎ², respectively. The identification of KLC1 variant E suggests that the dysfunction of intracellular trafficking is a causative factor of AÎ² pathology. This unique combination of distinct mouse strains and model mice with transcriptomics is expected to be useful for the study of genetic mechanisms of other complex diseases.  
24723886	The effects of automated artifact removal algorithms on electroencephalography-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140325 2014
Over the last decade, electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a reliable tool for the diagnosis of cortical disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). EEG signals, however, are susceptible to several artifacts, such as ocular, muscular, movement, and environmental. To overcome this limitation, existing diagnostic systems commonly depend on experienced clinicians to manually select artifact-free epochs from the collected multi-channel EEG data. Manual selection, however, is a tedious and time-consuming process, rendering the diagnostic system "semi-automated." Notwithstanding, a number of EEG artifact removal algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The (dis)advantages of using such algorithms in automated AD diagnostic systems, however, have not been documented; this paper aims to fill this gap. Here, we investigate the effects of three state-of-the-art automated artifact removal (AAR) algorithms (both alone and in combination with each other) on AD diagnostic systems based on four different classes of EEG features, namely, spectral, amplitude modulation rate of change, coherence, and phase. The three AAR algorithms tested are statistical artifact rejection (SAR), blind source separation based on second order blind identification and canonical correlation analysis (BSS-SOBI-CCA), and wavelet enhanced independent component analysis (wICA). Experimental results based on 20-channel resting-awake EEG data collected from 59 participants (20 patients with mild AD, 15 with moderate-to-severe AD, and 24 age-matched healthy controls) showed the wICA algorithm alone outperforming other enhancement algorithm combinations across three tasks: diagnosis (control vs. mild vs. moderate), early detection (control vs. mild), and disease progression (mild vs. moderate), thus opening the doors for fully-automated systems that can assist clinicians with early detection of AD, as well as disease severity progression assessment.  
24491999	The dark sides of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
FEBS Lett. 20140131 2014Mar3
Although widely explored, the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has yet to be cleared. Over the past twenty years the so call amyloid cascade hypothesis represented the main research paradigm in AD pathogenesis. In spite of its large consensus, the proposed role of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) remain to be elucidated. Many evidences are starting to cast doubt on AÎ² as the primary causative factor in AD. For instance, AÎ² is deposited in the brain following many different kinds of injury. Also, concentration of AÎ² needed to induce toxicity in vitro are never reached in vivo. In this review we propose an amyloid-independent interpretation of several AD pathogenic features, such as synaptic plasticity, endo-lysosomal trafficking, cell cycle regulation and neuronal survival.  
23857910	Elevated serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels in Alzheimer's disease.
Asia Pac Psychiatry 20130509 2014Mar
Copper takes part in a variety of biological reduction-oxidation (redox) processes, and is an important cofactor of many redox enzymes. Ceruloplasmin, the copper-transporting protein, also possesses an important redox capacity. We assessed serum copper, ceruloplasmin and free-copper levels in 89 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (mean age, 77.83 years; 41 men, 48 women) and in 118 healthy individuals (mean age, 69.93 years; 50 men, 68 women). High (â‰¥75th percentile), medium, and low (â‰¤25th percentile) copper, ceruloplasmin and free-copper groups were classified according to their serum level. Serum copper (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.026) and ceruloplasmin (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) levels were significantly higher in the AD group than in the control group. There was no significant difference in serum free-copper levels between AD and healthy elderly groups (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.975). After adjusting for age differences, serum copper (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.049) was still significantly higher in the AD group. Furthermore, serum copper levels correlated with scores on the Boston naming test (râ€‰=â€‰-0.151, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.037), indicating a close relationship between copper levels and cognitive abilities. The significant association between the copper concentration in peripheral serum and AD with elevated copper levels found in patients with AD is likely linked to the evolution of AD. Serum copper levels were significantly negatively correlated with scores on cognitive test subscores. AD patients may have significantly more "defective" ceruloplasmin, that is, apo-ceruloplasmin lacking its copper, than in healthy controls. 
24557150	Heavy metals toxicity: effect of cadmium ions on amyloid beta protein 1-42. Possible implications for Alzheimer's disease.
Biometals 20140221 2014Apr
Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental contaminant, highly toxic to humans. This biologically non-essential element accumulates in the body, especially in the kidney, liver, lung and brain and can induce several toxic effects, depending on the concentration and the exposure time. Cd has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a probable risk factor, as it shows higher concentrations in brain tissues of AD patients than in healthy people, its implication in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and in the aggregation process of amyloid beta peptides (AÎ²Ps). AÎ²Ps seem to have toxic properties, particularly in their aggregated state; insoluble AÎ²P forms, such as small and large aggregates, protofibrils and fibrils, appear to be implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. In our study, we have evaluated the effect of Cd, at different concentrations, both on the AÎ²P1-42 ion channel incorporated in a planar lipid membrane made up of phosphatidylcholine containing 30 % cholesterol and on the secondary structure of AÎ²P1-42 in aqueous environment. Cadmium is able to interact with the AÎ²P1-42 peptide by acting on the channel incorporated into the membrane as well as on the peptide in solution, both decreasing AÎ²P1-42 channel frequency and in solution forming large and amorphous aggregates prone to precipitate. These experimental observations suggesting a toxic role for Cd strengthen the hypothesis that Cd may interact directly with AÎ²Ps and may be a risk factor in AD. 
24219604	The genesis of closing-in in Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia: a comparative clinical and experimental study.
Neuropsychology 20131111 2014Mar
Closing-in (CI) in visuo-constructional tasks occurs when a drawing is reproduced close to or superimposed on the original model. CI has been often observed in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and only rarely investigated in patients with vascular dementia (VD). Recent studies suggested that CI in AD patients represents a default behavior released by frontal-executive impairments, but the cognitive mechanisms behind this phenomenon in VD patients have not been clarified. We aimed to ascertain whether the same mechanisms could determine CI in VD and in AD patients. For this purpose we explored whether CI is related to frontal-executive or visuospatial impairments in a prospective sample of AD and VD patients, and investigated whether CI can be induced by a secondary task in patients with either disease. Sixty-three VD patients and 70 AD patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment of frontal-executive and visuospatial skills, and a copying drawings task for CI. Moreover, VD and AD patients without CI also performed a drawing copying task combined with a simple or a demanding verbal task. In both VD and AD patients CI was related to frontal-executive impairments, with more severe forms of CI related to greater frontal-executive defects. In AD patients the tendency to deviate toward a salient model was significantly enhanced by reduction of cognitive resources, whereas VD could compensate for this tendency. CI is related to the tendency to deviate toward a salient model and can be released by frontal-executive impairments in demented patients, independently from clinical diagnosis. 
24715864	Recommendations for the use of Serious Games in people with Alzheimer's Disease, related disorders and frailty.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140324 2014
Alzheimer's disease and other related disorders (ADRD) represent a major challenge for health care systems within the aging population. It is therefore important to develop better instruments to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. This is the underlying idea for the development of Serious Games (SG). These are digital applications specially adapted for purposes other than entertaining; such as rehabilitation, training and education. Recently, there has been an increase of interest in the use of SG targeting patients with ADRD. However, this field is completely uncharted, and the clinical, ethical, economic and research impact of the employment of SG in these target populations has never been systematically addressed. The aim of this paper is to systematically analyze the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) of employing SG with patients with ADRD in order to provide practical recommendations for the development and use of SG in these populations. These analyses and recommendations were gathered, commented on and validated during a 2-round workshop in the context of the 2013 Clinical Trial of Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) conference, and endorsed by stakeholders in the field. The results revealed that SG may offer very useful tools for professionals involved in the care of patients suffering from ADRD. However, more interdisciplinary work should be done in order to create SG specifically targeting these populations. Furthermore, in order to acquire more academic and professional credibility and acceptance, it will be necessary to invest more in research targeting efficacy and feasibility. Finally, the emerging ethical challenges should be considered a priority.  
24401760	Inositol trisphosphate 3-kinase B is increased in human Alzheimer brain and exacerbates mouse Alzheimer pathology.
Brain 20140108 2014Feb
ITPKB phosphorylates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate into inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and controls signal transduction in various hematopoietic cells. Surprisingly, it has been reported that the ITPKB messenger RNA level is significantly increased in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease, compared with control subjects. As extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation is increased in the Alzheimer brain and as ITPKB is a regulator of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation in some hematopoietic cells, we tested whether this increased activation in Alzheimer's disease might be related to an increased activity of ITPKB. We show here that ITPKB protein level was increased 3-fold in the cerebral cortex of most patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with control subjects, and accumulated in dystrophic neurites associated to amyloid plaques. In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased Î²-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-Î² peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-Î² peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and Î²-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-Î²40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation. No impact on pathology was observed in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model when a catalytically inactive ITPKB protein was overexpressed. Together, our results point to the ITPKB/inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 signalling pathway as an important regulator of neuronal cell apoptosis, APP processing and tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease, and suggest that ITPKB could represent a new target for reducing pathology in human patients with Alzheimer's disease with ITPKB expression.  
24583584	[Quantitative and qualitative analyses for characteristics of the clock drawing in Alzheimer's disease].
Rinsho Shinkeigaku  2014
We analyzed the results of the clock drawing test (CDT) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate its significance for cognitive function screening. We administered the CDT and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) to a total of 156 AD patients, and CDT performance was scored quantitatively in accordance with the method by Freedman, while the CDT error types were qualitatively classified by Rouleau's method. We divided AD patients into three groups by their MMSE total score (A: 23 â‰¤, B: 18~22, C: â‰¤ 17). The mean total scores of CDT and MMSE in AD were 11.5 Â± 3.4 and 19.8 Â± 4.7, respectively, and the total CDT scores showed significant positive correlation with the total MMSE scores (r = 0.450). Fewer than 80% of subjects drew the clock correctly for 8 out of 15 sub-items, and fewer were able to correctly draw clock hands than could correctly draw numbers, contour or a center. In analysis of CDT qualitative error types, the most common error types were spatial and/or planning deficit (SPD) (28.2%), and conceptual deficit (CD) (23.7%), which suggested visuospatial impairments and semantic impairments play essential roles in AD patients' poor clock drawings. The frequency of CD and SPD error types significantly increased as severity of cognitive function worsened (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.05, respectively), and those of stimulus-bound response and perseveration had tendency to increase as severity of cognitive function. The present study suggests that CDT is a useful screening method not only for the impairment of cognitive function and the severity of cognitive dysfunction, but also for identification of specific cognitive function impairments in AD patients. 
24711813	Cardioprotection and anticholinesterases in patients with Alzheimer's disease: time for reappraisal.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra 20140214 2014Jan
Traditional risk factors, like impaired transmitral flow in diastolic filling [vortex formation time (VFT) as echocardiographic parameter], contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, we observed that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide a significant cardioprotection. We assessed the pathogenetic role of VFT as early cardiovascular risk factor in 23 AD patients and 24 controls. The results showed no statistical difference between the two groups, but the VFT values were significantly lower in nontreated AD patients, and higher value were observed in AD patients treated with anticholinesterases. The results support the beneficial effects of anticholinesterases on the cardiovascular system of AD patients. Thus, the transition to evidence-based medicine and an in vivo model of cardiomyocytes might strengthen these results. 
24711814	Caregiver Burden in Alzheimer's Disease: Differential Associations in Adult-Child and Spousal Caregivers in the GERAS Observational Study.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra 20140219 2014Jan
To examine factors influencing the caregiver burden in adult-child and spousal caregivers of community-dwelling patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Baseline data from the 18-month, prospective, observational GERAS study of 1,497 patients with AD in France, Germany, and the UK were used. Analyses were performed on two groups of caregivers: spouses (n = 985) and adult children (n = 405). General linear models estimated patient and caregiver factors associated with subjective caregiver burden assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview. The caregiver burden increased with AD severity. Adult-child caregivers experienced a higher burden than spousal caregivers despite spending less time caring. Worse patient functional ability and more caregiver distress were independently associated with a greater burden in both adult-child and spousal caregivers. Additional factors were differentially associated with a greater caregiver burden in both groups. In adult-child caregivers these were: living with the patient, patient living in an urban location, and patient with a fall in the past 3 months; in spouses the factors were: caregiver gender (female) and age (younger), and more years of patient education. The perceived burden differed between adult-child and spousal caregivers, and specific patient and caregiver factors were differentially associated with this burden. 
24329968	Geniposide Ameliorates Learning Memory Deficits, Reduces Tau Phosphorylation and Decreases Apoptosis via GSK3Î² Pathway in Streptozotocin-Induced Alzheimer Rat Model.
Brain Pathol. 20140212 2014Apr
Intracerebral-ventricular (ICV) injection of streptozotocin (STZ) induces an insulin-resistant brain state that may underlie the neural pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Our previous work showed that prior ICV treatment of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) could prevent STZ-induced learning memory impairment and tau hyperphosphorylation in the rat brain. The Chinese herbal medicine geniposide is known to relieve symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Because geniposide is thought to act as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, we investigated the potential therapeutic effect of geniposide on STZ-induced AD model in rats. Our result showed that a single injection of geniposide (50â€‰Î¼M, 10â€‰Î¼L) to the lateral ventricle prevented STZ-induced spatial learning deficit by about 40% and reduced tau phosphorylation by about 30% with Morris water maze test and quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, respectively. It has been known that tau protein can be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and STZ can increase the activity of GSK3Î². Our result with Western blot analysis showed that central administration of geniposide resulted in an elevated expression of GSK3Î²(pS-9) but suppressed GSK3Î²(pY-216) indicating that geniposide reduced STZ-induced GSK3Î² hyperactivity. In addition, ultrastructure analysis showed that geniposide averted STZ-induced neural pathology, including paired helical filament (PHF)-like structures, accumulation of vesicles in synaptic terminal, abnormalities of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and early stage of apoptosis. In summary, our study suggests that the water soluble and orally active monomer of Chinese herbal medicine geniposide may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of sporadic AD.  
24450890	Phase 3 trials of solanezumab for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
N. Engl. J. Med.  2014Jan23
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis, and neuronal loss. Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, preferentially binds soluble forms of amyloid and in preclinical studies promoted its clearance from the brain. In two phase 3, double-blind trials (EXPEDITION 1 and EXPEDITION 2), we randomly assigned 1012 and 1040 patients, respectively, with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease to receive placebo or solanezumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 400 mg) every 4 weeks for 18 months. The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline to week 80 in scores on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11; range, 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL; range, 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating worse functioning). After analysis of data from EXPEDITION 1, the primary outcome for EXPEDITION 2 was revised to the change in scores on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater impairment), in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Neither study showed significant improvement in the primary outcomes. The modeled difference between groups (solanezumab group minus placebo group) in the change from baseline was -0.8 points for the ADAS-cog11 score (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.1 to 0.5; P=0.24) and -0.4 points for the ADCS-ADL score (95% CI, -2.3 to 1.4; P=0.64) in EXPEDITION 1 and -1.3 points (95% CI, -2.5 to 0.3; P=0.06) and 1.6 points (95% CI, -0.2 to 3.3; P=0.08), respectively, in EXPEDITION 2. Between-group differences in the changes in the ADAS-cog14 score were -1.7 points in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (95% CI, -3.5 to 0.1; P=0.06) and -1.5 in patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease (95% CI, -4.1 to 1.1; P=0.26). In the combined safety data set, the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or hemorrhage was 0.9% with solanezumab and 0.4% with placebo for edema (P=0.27) and 4.9% and 5.6%, respectively, for hemorrhage (P=0.49). Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.

24324264	Cognitive deficits and disruption of neurogenesis in a mouse model of apolipoprotein E4 domain interaction.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131209 2014Jan31
Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) allele is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) due to the higher prevalence and earlier onset of AD in apoE4 carriers. Accumulating data suggest that the interaction between the N- and the C-terminal domains in the protein may be the main pathologic feature of apoE4. To test this hypothesis, we used Arg-61 mice, a model of apoE4 domain interaction, by introducing the domain interaction feature of human apoE4 into native mouse apoE. We carried out hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tests and related cellular and molecular assays on 12- and 3-month-old Arg-61 and age-matched background C57BL/6J mice. Learning and memory task performance were impaired in Arg-61 mice at both old and young ages compared with C57BL/6J mice. Surprisingly, young Arg-61 mice had more mitotic doublecortin-positive cells in the subgranular zone; mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB were also higher in 3-month-old Arg-61 hippocampus compared with C57BL/6J mice. These early-age neurotrophic and neurogenic (proliferative) effects in the Arg-61 mouse may be an inadequate compensatory but eventually detrimental attempt by the system to "repair" itself. This is supported by the higher cleaved caspase-3 levels in the young animals that not only persisted, but increased in old age, and the lower levels of doublecortin at old age in the hippocampus of Arg-61 mice. These results are consistent with human apoE4-dependent cognitive and neuro-pathologic changes, supporting the principal role of domain interaction in the pathologic effect of apoE4. Domain interaction is, therefore, a viable therapeutic/prophylactic target for cognitive impairment and AD in apoE4 subjects.  
24487797	Alzheimer disease and cellular mechanisms of memory storage.
J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.  2014Mar
Most ongoing efforts to combat Alzheimer disease (AD) are focused on treating its clinical symptoms, but the neuropathologic changes underlying AD appear decades earlier and become essentially irreversible by the time the disease reaches its clinical stages. This necessitates treating AD at preclinical stages, which requires a better understanding of the primary mechanisms leading to AD pathology. Here I argue that such an understanding calls for addressing perhaps the most puzzling question in AD-why the underlying pathology selectively impairs neurons that are involved in memory formation and storage. Memory formation is associated with epigenetic chromatin modifications and may, therefore, be accompanied by the synthesis of proteins unique to neurons involved in memory. These proteins could be recognized by the immune system as "nonself" antigens. This does not happen in the healthy brain because of its isolation from the immune system by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). All risk factors for AD impair the BBB, which may allow the immune system to attack memory-involved neurons and make them vulnerable to AD-associated pathology. This hypothesis is testable and, if confirmed, could redirect therapeutic efforts toward maintaining BBB integrity people belonging to AD risk groups rather than treating them when it is too late.  
24553930	A sensitive aÎ² oligomer assay discriminates Alzheimer's and aged control cerebrospinal fluid.
J. Neurosci.  2014Feb19
A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is the amyloid Î² (AÎ²) plaque, which is comprised of AÎ² peptides. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that AÎ² oligomers are more toxic than other peptide forms. We sought to develop a robust assay to quantify oligomers from CSF. Antibody 19.3 was compared in one-site and competitive ELISAs for oligomer binding specificity. A two-site ELISA for oligomers was developed using 19.3 coupled to a sensitive, bead-based fluorescent platform able to detect single photons of emitted light. The two-site ELISA was &gt;2500Ã— selective for AÎ² oligomers over AÎ² monomers with a limit of detection âˆ¼ 0.09 pg/ml in human CSF. The lower limit of reliable quantification of the assay was 0.18 pg/ml and the antibody pairs recognized AÎ² multimers comprised of either synthetic standards, or endogenous oligomers isolated from confirmed human AD and healthy control brain. Using the assay, a significant 3- to 5-fold increase in AÎ² oligomers in human AD CSF compared with comparably aged controls was demonstrated. The increase was seen in three separate human cohorts, totaling 63 AD and 54 controls. CSF oligomers ranged between 0.1 and 10 pg/ml. AÎ² oligomer levels did not strongly associate with age or gender, but had an inverse correlation with MMSE score. The C statistic for the AÎ² oligomer ROC curve was 0.86, with 80% sensitivity and 88% specificity to detect AD, suggesting reasonable discriminatory power for the AD state and the potential for utility as a diagnostic marker. 
24423585	Screening of microRNAs associated with Alzheimer's disease using oxidative stress cell model and different strains of senescence accelerated mice.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20131215 2014Mar15
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the molecular mechanisms that control the neuron response to oxidative stress have been extensively studied. However, the effects of oxidative stress on miRNA expression in hippocampal neurons has not been investigated, and little is known about the roles of ROS-modulated miRNAs in cell function as yet. In this study, miRNA microarray technology was used to analyze the expression of miRNAs in the oxidative stressed primary hippocampal neurons, hippocampus of senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) and prone 10 (SAMP10). The targets of co-regulated microRNAs were also selected for computational prediction using miRWalk software and functional analysis by the DAVID software. In addition, the changes of co-regulated microRNA expression were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The results of microarray analysis showed that miR-329, miR-193b, miR-20a, miR-296, and miR-130b were all upregulated in H2O2-induced primary hippocampal neurons and different strains of senescence accelerated mice. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that these co-regulated microRNAs may be involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, signal transmission and cancer development. In which, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was one of the most significant pathways to be affected by 83 target genes of miR-329, miR-193b, miR-20a miR-296, and miR-130b. The quantitative real-time PCR data confirmed the alterations of the co-upregulated miRNAs. These results suggested that oxidative stress alters the miRNA expression profile of hippocampal neurons, and the deregulated miRNAs might play potential roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study provided a strong basis for the future study aiming at contributions of miRNAs induced by oxidative stress in AD.  
24447596	Changes in the brain and plasma AÎ² peptide levels with age and its relationship with cognitive impairment in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroscience 20140118 2014Mar28
Double transgenic mice expressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and mutant presenilin 1 (PS1dE9) are a model of Alzheimer-type amyloidosis and are widely used in experimental studies. In the present work, the relationships between brain and plasma amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) levels and cognitive impairments were examined in male APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice at different ages. When compared with non-transgenic littermates, APPswe/PS1dE9 mice exhibited significant learning deficits from the age of 6months (M6), which were aggravated at later stages of life (M8 and M12). Sporadic brain amyloid plaques were observed in mice as early as M3 and progressively increased in number and size up to M12. A similar increase was observed in brain insoluble AÎ² levels as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In particular, the levels of brain insoluble AÎ² peptides rose steeply from M4 to M6. Interestingly, this pronounced amyloid deposition was accompanied by a temporary fall in the concentration of brain soluble and membrane-bound AÎ² peptides at M6 that rose again at M8 and M12. The plasma levels of AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 decreased with advancing age up to M8, when they stabilized at M12. This decrease in plasma AÎ² levels coincided with the observed increase in insoluble brain AÎ² levels. These results could be useful for developing plasma AÎ² levels as possible biomarkers of the cerebral amyloidosis and provide advances in the knowledge of the AÎ² peptide biochemical changes that occur in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients.  
24586483	A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of microRNA-146a is associated with the risk of Alzheimer disease and the rate of cognitive decline in patients.
PLoS ONE 20140225 2014
miR146a is well known for its regulatory role in the immune response and inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated the links between miR146a and Alzheimer disease (AD) and suggested that miR146a may be involved in neuroinflammation and the metabolism of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), which are critical events in AD pathology. Although genetic studies have focused on the association between the miR146a gene and susceptibility to several diseases, no association study of miR146a variability with AD has been conducted. In this report, we performed a case-control association study to analyze the genotype and allele distributions of the miR146a, rs2910464 and rs57095329 polymorphisms in a Chinese population consisting of 292 AD cases and 300 healthy controls. We found a significant difference in the genotypes and allele frequencies of rs57095329 between the AD cases and the controls (p = 0.0147 and p = 0.0184, respectively), where the AA genotype of rs57095329 was associated with an increased risk of AD as well the cognitive decline in AD patients. Additionally, the AA genotype of rs57095329 exhibited significantly higher miR146a expression than the GG+GA genotypes of rs2910164 in the peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) of healthy individuals and had a stronger effect on the production of IL-6 and IL-1Î² when the cells were stimulated with LPS. Our data provide preliminary evidence that the rs57095329 polymorphism in the miR146a promoter is involved in the genetic susceptibility to AD, and this risk AA genotype may increase the expression of miR146a and influence certain proinflammatory cytokines, thus playing a role in the pathogenesis of AD. 
24586664	Impact of a community based implementation of REACH II program for caregivers of Alzheimer's patients.
PLoS ONE 20140227 2014
In 2009 an estimated 5.3 million people in the United States were afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative form of dementia. The impact of this disease is not limited to the patient but also has significant impact on the lives and health of their family caregivers. The Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH II) program was developed and tested in clinical studies. The REACH II program is now being delivered by community agencies in several locations. This study examines the impact of the REACH II program on caregiver lives and health in a city in north Texas. Family caregivers of Alzheimer's patients were assessed using an instrument covering the multi-item domains of Caregiver Burden, Depression, Self-Care, and Social Support upon enrollment in the program and at the completion of the 6 month intervention. The domain scores were analyzed using a multivariate paired t-test and Bonferroni confidence interval for the differences in pre- and post-service domain scores. A total of 494 families were enrolled in the program during the period January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012. Of these families 177 completed the 6 month program and have pre - and post service domain scores. The median age for the caregivers was 62 years. The domain scores for Depression and Caregiver Burden demonstrated statistically significant improvements upon program completion. The REACH II intervention was successfully implemented by a community agency with comparable impacts to those of the clinical trial warranting wider scale implementation. 
24587236	Metabotyping of docosahexaenoic acid - treated Alzheimer's disease cell model.
PLoS ONE 20140227 2014
Despite the significant amount of work being carried out to investigate the therapeutic potential of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the mechanism by which DHA affects amyloid-Î² precursor protein (AÎ²PP)-induced metabolic changes has not been studied. To elucidate the metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes) associated with DHA therapy via metabonomic profiling of an AD cell model using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOFMS). The lysate and supernatant samples of CHO-wt and CHO-AÎ²PP695 cells treated with DHA and vehicle control were collected and prepared for GC/TOFMS metabonomics profiling. The metabolic profiles were analyzed by multivariate data analysis techniques using SIMCA-P+ software. Both principal component analysis and subsequent partial least squares discriminant analysis revealed distinct metabolites associated with the DHA-treated and control groups. A list of statistically significant marker metabolites that characterized the metabotypes associated with DHA treatment was further identified. Increased levels of succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid and glycine and decreased levels of zymosterol, cholestadiene and arachidonic acid correlated with DHA treatment effect. DHA levels were also found to be increased upon treatment. Our study shows that DHA plays a role in mitigating AÎ²PP-induced impairment in energy metabolism and inflammation by acting on tricarboxylic acid cycle, cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and fatty acid metabolism. The perturbations of these metabolic pathways by DHA in CHO-wt and CHO-AÎ²PP695 cells shed further mechanistic insights on its neuroprotective actions. 
24707311	New Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, Kamikihito, Reverses Amyloid-Î²-Induced Progression of Tau Phosphorylation and Axonal Atrophy.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140223 2014
Aims. We previously reported that kamikihito (KKT), a traditional Japanese medicine, improved memory impairment and reversed the degeneration of axons in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying the effects of KKT remained unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism by which KKT reverses the progression of axonal degeneration. Methods. Primary cultured cortical neurons were treated with amyloid beta (A Î² ) fragment comprising amino acid residues (25-35) (10â€‰ Î¼ M) in an in vitro AD model. KKT (10â€‰ Î¼ g/mL) was administered to the cells before or after A Î² treatment. The effects of KKT on A Î² -induced tau phosphorylation, axonal atrophy, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity were investigated. We also performed an in vivo assay in which KKT (500â€‰mg/kg/day) was administered to 5XFAD mice once a day for 15 days. Cerebral cortex homogenates were used to measure PP2A activity. Results. KKT improved A Î² -induced tau phosphorylation and axonal atrophy after they had already progressed. In addition, KKT increased PP2A activity in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions. KKT reversed the progression of A Î² -induced axonal degeneration. KKT reversed axonal degeneration at least in part through its role as an exogenous PP2A stimulator.  
24480125	A label-free electrical impedimetric biosensor for the specific detection of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta oligomers.
Biosens Bioelectron 20131224 2014Jun15
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with over 37 million sufferers worldwide and a global cost of over $600 billion. There is currently no cure for AD and no reliable method of diagnosis other than post-mortem brain examination. The development of a point-of-care test for AD is an urgent requirement in order to provide earlier diagnosis and, thus, useful therapeutic intervention. Here, we present a novel, label-free impedimetric biosensor for the specific detection of amyloid-beta oligomers (AÎ²O), which are the primary neurotoxic species in AD. AÎ²O have been proposed as the best biomarker for AD and levels of AÎ²O in the blood have been found to correlate with cerebrospinal fluid load. The biorecognition element of our biosensor is a fragment of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C), residues 95-110), a highly expressed synaptic protein which mediates the neuronal binding and toxicity of AÎ²O. During the layer-by-layer sensor construction, biotinylated PrP(C) (95-110) was attached via a biotin/NeutrAvidin bridge to polymer-functionalised gold screen-printed electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy were used to validate biosensor assembly and functionality. EIS was employed for biosensor interrogation in the presence of AÎ² oligomers or monomers. The biosensor was specific for the detection of synthetic AÎ²O and gave a linear response, without significant detection of monomeric AÎ², down to an equivalent AÎ²O concentration of ~0.5 pM. The biosensor was also able to detect natural, cell-derived AÎ²O present in conditioned medium. The eventual commercialisation of this biosensor system could allow for the early diagnosis and disease monitoring of AD. 
24502897	Toxicological and pharmacological evaluation, antioxidant, ADMET and molecular modeling of selected racemic chromenotacrines {11-amino-12-aryl-8,9,10,12-tetrahydro-7H-chromeno[2,3-b]quinolin-3-ols} for the potential prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20140108 2014Mar3
The pharmacological analysis of racemic chromenotacrines (CT) 1-7, bearing the 11-amino-12-aryl-8,9,10,12-tetrahydro-7H-chromeno[2,3-b]quinolin-3-ol ring skeleton, in a series of experiments targeted to explore their potential use for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is reported. The toxicological evaluation showed that among all these chromenotacrines, CT6 is much less hepatotoxic than tacrine in a range of concentrations from 1 to 300 Î¼M, measured as cell viability in HepG2 cells. Moreover, CT6 did not significantly increase lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase release in HepG2 cells. Besides, CT6 treatment exerts a high protective effect against the lipid peroxidation induced after Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚-treated SH-SY5Y cells, in a concentration-dependent manner. CT6 showed an excellent antioxidant profile in the AAPH test, and protects against the decrease in cell viability induced by respiratory chain inhibitors (Oligomicyn A/Rotenone) and NO donors in neuronal cultures. This effect could be due to a mixed antiapoptotic and antinecrotic neuroprotective effect at low and intermediate CT6 concentrations, respectively. CT1-7 are potent and selective inhibitors of EeAChE in the submicromolar range. CT3 [ICâ‚…â‚€ (EeAChE) = 0.007 Â± 0.003 Î¼M], and CT6 [ICâ‚…â‚€ (EeAChE) = 0.041 Â± 0.001 Î¼M] are the most potent AChE inhibitors. Kinetic studies on the non-toxic chromenotacrine CT6 showed that this compound behaves as a non-competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.047 Â± 0.003 Î¼M), indicating that CT6 binds at the peripheral anionic site, a fact confirmed by molecular modeling analysis. In silico ADMET analysis showed also that CT6 should have a moderate BBB permeability. Consequently, non-toxic chromenotacrine CT6 can be considered as an attractive multipotent molecule for the potential treatment of AD. 
24582259	Synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with a DDNP-carboxyl derivative for in vitro magnetic resonance imaging of Alzheimer's disease.
Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl 20140109 2014Apr1
Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been proposed for use in magnetic resonance imaging as versatile ultra-sensitive nanoprobes for Alzheimer's disease imaging. In this work, we synthetized an efficient contrast agent of Alzheimer's disease using 1,1-dicyano-2-[6-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-2-yl]propene (DDNP) carboxyl derivative to functionalize the surface of SPIONs. The DDNP-SPIONs are prepared by conjugating DDNP carboxyl derivative to oleic acid-treated SPIONs through ligand exchange. The structure, size distribution and magnetic property were identified by IR, TGA-DTA, XRD, TEM, Zetasizer Nano and VSM. TEM and Zetasizer Nano observations indicated that the DDNP-SPIONs are relatively mono-dispersed spherical distribution with an average size of 11.7nm. The DDNP-SPIONs were then further analyzed for their MRI relaxation properties using MR imaging and demonstrated high T2 relaxivity of 140.57s(-1)FemM(-1), and the vitro experiment that DDNP-SPIONs binding to Î²-Amyloid aggregates were then investigated by fluorophotometry, the results showed that the combination had induced the fluorescence enhancement of the DDNP-SPIONs and displayed tremendous promise for use as a contrast agent of Alzheimer's disease in MRI.  
24373902	Pharmacological characterization of the novel Î³-secretase modulator AS2715348, a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease, in rodents and nonhuman primates.
Neuropharmacology 20131225 2014Apr
Î³-Secretase is the enzyme responsible for the intramembranous proteolysis of various substrates, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. Amyloid-Î² peptide 42 (AÎ²42) is produced through the sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP by Î²- and Î³-secretase and causes the synaptic dysfunction associated with memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we identified a novel cyclohexylamine-derived Î³-secretase modulator, {(1R*,2S*,3R*)-3-[(cyclohexylmethyl)(3,3-dimethylbutyl)amino]-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]cyclohexyl}acetic acid (AS2715348), that may inhibit this pathological response. AS2715348 was seen to reduce both cell-free and cellular production of AÎ²42 without increasing levels of APP Î²-carboxyl terminal fragment or inhibiting Notch signaling. Additionally, the compound increased AÎ²38 production, suggesting a shift of the cleavage site in APP. The inhibitory potency of AS2715348 on endogenous AÎ²42 production was similar across human, mouse, and rat cells. Oral administration with AS2715348 at 1Â mg/kg and greater significantly reduced brain AÎ²42 levels in rats, and no Notch-related toxicity was observed after 28-day treatment at 100Â mg/kg. Further, AS2715348 significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in APP-transgenic Tg2576 mice. Finally, AS2715348 significantly reduced brain AÎ²42 levels in cynomolgus monkeys. These findings collectively show the promise for AS2715348 as a potential disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer's disease.  
24462621	Tolfenamic acid downregulates BACE1 and protects against lead-induced upregulation of Alzheimer's disease related biomarkers.
Neuropharmacology 20140121 2014Apr
Environmental exposure to lead (Pb) early in life results in a latent upregulation of genes and products associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly the plaque forming protein amyloid beta (AÎ²). Furthermore, animals exposed to Pb as infants develop cognitive decline and memory impairments in old age. Studies from our lab demonstrated that tolfenamic acid lowers the levels of the amyloid Î² precursor protein (APP) and its aggregative cleavage product AÎ² by inducing the degradation of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1). These changes were accompanied by cognitive improvement in transgenic APP knock-in mice. In this study, we examined the effects of tolfenamic acid on beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) which is responsible for AÎ² production and tested its ability to reverse Pb-induced upregulation in the amyloidogenic pathway. Mice were administered tolfenamic acid for one month and BACE1 gene expression as well as its enzymatic activity were analyzed in the cerebral cortex. Tolfenamic acid was also tested for its ability to reverse changes in Sp1, APP and AÎ² that were upregulated by Pb inÂ vitro. Differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were either left unexposed, or sequentially exposed to Pb followed by tolfenamic acid. Our results show that tolfenamic acid reduced BACE1 gene expression and enzyme activity in mice. In neuroblastoma cells, Pb upregulated Sp1, APP and AÎ², while tolfenamic acid lowered their expression. These results along with previous data from our lab provide evidence that tolfenamic acid, a drug that has been used for decades for migraine, represents a candidate which can reduce the pathology of AD and may mitigate the damage of environmental risk factors associated with this disease.  
24586603	Cognitive and affective changes in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients undergoing switch of cholinesterase inhibitors: a 6-month observational study.
PLoS ONE 20140219 2014
Patients with Alzheimer's disease after an initial response to cholinesterase inhibitors may complain a later lack of efficacy. This, in association with incident neuropsychiatric symptoms, may worsen patient quality of life. Thus, the switch to another cholinesterase inhibitor could represent a valid therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the switch from one to another cholinesterase inhibitor on cognitive and affective symptoms in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease patients. Four hundred twenty-three subjects were included from the EVOLUTION study, an observational, longitudinal, multicentre study conducted on Alzheimer disease patients who switched to different cholinesterase inhibitor due either to lack/loss of efficacy or response, reduced tolerability or poor compliance. All patients underwent cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments, carried out before the switch (baseline), and at 3 and 6-month follow-up. A significant effect of the different switch types was found on Mini-Mental State Examination score during time, with best effectiveness on mild Alzheimer's disease patients switching from oral cholinesterase inhibitors to rivastigmine patch. Depressive symptoms, when measured using continuous Neuropsychiatric Inventory values, decreased significantly, while apathy symptoms remained stable over the 6 months after the switch. However, frequency of both depression and apathy, when measured categorically using Neuropsychiatric Inventory cut-off scores, did not change significantly during time. In mild to moderate Alzheimer disease patients with loss of efficacy and tolerability during cholinesterase inhibitor treatment, the switch to another cholinesterase inhibitor may represent an important option for slowing cognitive deterioration. The evidence of apathy stabilization and the positive tendency of depressive symptom improvement should definitively be confirmed in double-blind controlled studies.  
24586789	Galantamine slows down plaque formation and behavioral decline in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140221 2014
The plant alkaloid galantamine is an established symptomatic drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), providing temporary cognitive and global relief in human patients. In this study, the 5X Familial Alzheimer's Disease (5XFAD) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of chronic galantamine treatment on behavior and amyloid Î² (AÎ²) plaque deposition in the mouse brain. Quantification of plaques in untreated 5XFAD mice showed a gender specific phenotype; the plaque density increased steadily reaching saturation in males after 10 months of age, whereas in females the density further increased until after 14 months of age. Moreover, females consistently displayed a higher plaque density in comparison to males of the same age. Chronic oral treatment with galantamine resulted in improved performance in behavioral tests, such as open field and light-dark avoidance, already at mildly affected stages compared to untreated controls. Treated animals of both sexes showed significantly lower plaque density in the brain, i.e., the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, gliosis being always positively correlated to plaque load. A high dose treatment with a daily uptake of 26 mg/kg body weight was tolerated well and produced significantly larger positive effects than a lower dose treatment (14 mg/kg body weight) in terms of plaque density and behavior. These results strongly support that galantamine, in addition to improving cognitive and behavioral symptoms in AD, may have disease-modifying and neuroprotective properties, as is indicated by delayed AÎ² plaque formation and reduced gliosis.  
24587388	Blood platelets in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140228 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurotoxic amyloid-ÃŸ plaque formation in brain parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Besides CAA, AD is strongly related to vascular diseases such as stroke and atherosclerosis. Cerebrovascular dysfunction occurs in AD patients leading to alterations in blood flow that might play an important role in AD pathology with neuronal loss and memory deficits. Platelets are the major players in hemostasis and thrombosis, but are also involved in neuroinflammatory diseases like AD. For many years, platelets were accepted as peripheral model to study the pathophysiology of AD because platelets display the enzymatic activities to generate amyloid-ÃŸ (AÃŸ) peptides. In addition, platelets are considered to be a biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. Effects of AÃŸ peptides on platelets and the impact of platelets in the progression of AD remained, however, ill-defined. The present study explored the cellular mechanisms triggered by AÃŸ in platelets. Treatment of platelets with AÃŸ led to platelet activation and enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membrane scrambling, suggesting enhanced platelet apoptosis. More important, platelets modulate soluble AÃŸ into fibrillar structures that were absorbed by apoptotic but not vital platelets. This together with enhanced platelet adhesion under flow ex vivo and in vivo and platelet accumulation at amyloid deposits of cerebral vessels of AD transgenic mice suggested that platelets are major contributors of CAA inducing platelet thrombus formation at vascular amyloid plaques leading to vessel occlusion critical for cerebrovascular events like stroke.  
24625061	Microglia receptors and their implications in the response to amyloid Î² for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
J Neuroinflammation 20140313 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health problem with substantial economic and social impacts around the world. The hallmarks of AD pathogenesis include deposition of amyloid Î² (AÎ²), neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. For many years, research has been focused on AÎ² accumulation in senile plaques, as these aggregations were perceived as the main cause of the neurodegeneration found in AD. However, increasing evidence suggests that inflammation also plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Microglia cells are the resident macrophages of the brain and act as the first line of defense in the central nervous system. In AD, microglia play a dual role in disease progression, being essential for clearing AÎ² deposits and releasing cytotoxic mediators. AÎ² activates microglia through a variety of innate immune receptors expressed on these cells. The mechanisms through which amyloid deposits provoke an inflammatory response are not fully understood, but it is believed that these receptors cooperate in the recognition, internalization, and clearance of AÎ² and in cell activation. In this review, we discuss the role of several receptors expressed on microglia in AÎ² recognition, uptake, and signaling, and their implications for AD pathogenesis.  
23714377	Beta-amyloid, phospho-tau and alpha-synuclein deposits similar to those in the brain are not identified in the eyes of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients.
Brain Pathol. 20130628 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common neurodegenerative disorders, and are characterized by deposition of specific proteins in the brain. If similar abnormal protein deposits are present in the eye, it would facilitate noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. We therefore evaluated expression of proteins associated with AD and PD pathology in postmortem eyes and brains in a case-control study. Eyes from 11 cases of AD, 6 cases of PD or PD with dementia, and 6 age-matched controls were retrieved from the autopsy archives of The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Immunostains for Î²-amyloid, phospho-tau and Î±-synuclein and Congo red stains were performed in the same laboratory in both brains and eyes. No amyloid deposits or abnormal tau accumulations were detected in the lens, retina or other structures in the eyes of AD patients. Eyes also lacked definite Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites in either PD or AD cases. Patchy cytoplasmic Î±-synuclein positivity was seen in the retina of AD, PD and control cases, but did not correlate with the presence or extent of Lewy body pathology in the brain. Abnormal protein aggregations characteristic of AD and PD are thus not commonly present in the retinas or lens of affected patients when assayed using the same protocols as in the brain. This suggests that Î²-amyloid, phospho-tau and Î±-synuclein either do not deposit in the eye in a manner analogous to brain, or are present at lower levels or in different forms.  
24117759	Blocking the apolipoprotein E/amyloid Î² interaction in triple transgenic mice ameliorates Alzheimer's disease related amyloid Î² and tau pathology.
J. Neurochem. 20131106 2014Feb
Inheritance of the apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) genotype has been identified as the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that the binding between apoE and amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides occurs at residues 244-272 of apoE and residues 12-28 of AÎ². ApoE4 has been implicated in promoting AÎ² deposition and impairing clearance of AÎ². We hypothesized that blocking the apoE/AÎ² interaction would serve as an effective new approach to AD therapy. We have previously shown that treatment with AÎ²12-28P can reduce amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice and vascular amyloid in TgSwDI mice with congophilic amyloid angiopathy. In the present study, we investigated whether the AÎ²12-28P elicits a therapeutic effect on tau-related pathology in addition to amyloid pathology using old triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg, with PS1M146V , APPSwe and tauP30IL transgenes) with established pathology from the ages of 21 to 26 months. We show that treatment with AÎ²12-28P substantially reduces tau pathology both immunohistochemically and biochemically, as well as reducing the amyloid burden and suppressing the activation of astrocytes and microglia. These affects correlate with a behavioral amelioration in the treated Tg mice. 
24331205	Assessment of regional MR diffusion changes in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.
Int Psychogeriatr 20131216 2014Apr
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common forms of dementia, yet diagnosis is often difficult. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MR technique used to assess neuronal microstructural integrity that may help develop a better understanding of the differences between the conditions. We recruited subjects with DLB (n = 35), AD (n = 36), and similar aged healthy controls (n = 35). T1 weighted anatomical and diffusion MR images were acquired at 3 Tesla. Region of interest (ROI) analysis was used to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in five structures: precuneus, thalamus, pons, midbrain, and amygdala. Where appropriate diffusivity measures (FA, MD) were correlated with selected clinical measures. Compared to controls, DLB subjects were characterized by reduced FA (p = 0.016) and increased MD (p = 0.007) in the precuneus. Amygdala diffusivity was positively correlated with UPDRS-III score in DLB (p = 0.003). In AD, reduced FA in the precuneus was also observed compared to controls (p = 0.026), and was associated with impaired global cognition (MMSE score) (p = 0.03). Our findings highlight the potential importance of the precuneus in the pathogenesis of DLB as well as AD. Diffusion tensor MRI may shed new light on the different neurobiological changes underpinning the key clinical features of DLB and AD. 
24701363	Novel Point Mutations and A8027G Polymorphism in Mitochondrial-DNA-Encoded Cytochrome c Oxidase II Gene in Mexican Patients with Probable Alzheimer Disease.
Int J Alzheimers Dis 20140218 2014
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been thought to contribute to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis through the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations and net production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase plays a key role in the regulation of aerobic production of energy and is composed of 13 subunits. The 3 largest subunits (I, II, and III) forming the catalytic core are encoded by mitochondrial DNA. The aim of this work was to look for mutations in mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase gene II (MTCO II) in blood samples from probable AD Mexican patients. MTCO II gene was sequenced in 33 patients with diagnosis of probable AD. Four patients (12%) harbored the A8027G polymorphism and three of them were early onset (EO) AD cases with familial history of the disease. In addition, other four patients with EOAD had only one of the following point mutations: A8003C, T8082C, C8201T, or G7603A. Neither of the point mutations found in this work has been described previously for AD patients, and the A8027G polymorphism has been described previously; however, it hasn't been related to AD. We will need further investigation to demonstrate the role of the point mutations of mitochondrial DNA in the pathogenesis of AD.  
24352658	Pharmacologic stimulation of cytochrome P450 46A1 and cerebral cholesterol turnover in mice.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131218 2014Feb7
Cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) is a brain-specific cholesterol 24-hydroxylase responsible for the majority of cholesterol elimination from the brain. Genetically increased CYP46A1 expression in mice leads to improved cognition and decreases manifestations of Alzheimer disease. We found that four pharmaceuticals (efavirenz (EFV), acetaminophen, mirtazapine, and galantamine) prescribed for indications unrelated to cholesterol maintenance increased CYP46A1 activity in vitro. We then evaluated the anti-HIV medication EFV for the mode of interaction with CYP46A1 and the effect on mice. We propose a model for CYP46A1 activation by EFV and show that EFV enhanced CYP46A1 activity and cerebral cholesterol turnover in animals with no effect on the levels of brain cholesterol. The doses of EFV administered to mice and required for the stimulation of their cerebral cholesterol turnover are a hundred times lower than those prescribed to HIV patients. At such small doses, EFV may be devoid of adverse effects elicited by high drug concentrations. CYP46A1 could be a novel therapeutic target and a tool to further investigate the physiological and medical significance of cerebral cholesterol turnover.  
24366863	Oxidation-induced structural changes of ceruloplasmin foster NGR motif deamidation that promotes integrin binding and signaling.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131223 2014Feb7
Asparagine deamidation occurs spontaneously in proteins during aging; deamidation of Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) sites can lead to the formation of isoAsp-Gly-Arg (isoDGR), a motif that can recognize the RGD-binding site of integrins. Ceruloplasmin (Cp), a ferroxidase present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), contains two NGR sites in its sequence: one exposed on the protein surface ((568)NGR) and the other buried in the tertiary structure ((962)NGR). Considering that Cp can undergo oxidative modifications in the CSF of neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated the effect of oxidation on the deamidation of both NGR motifs and, consequently, on the acquisition of integrin binding properties. We observed that the exposed (568)NGR site can deamidate under conditions mimicking accelerated Asn aging. In contrast, the hidden (962)NGR site can deamidate exclusively when aging occurs under oxidative conditions, suggesting that oxidation-induced structural changes foster deamidation at this site. NGR deamidation in Cp was associated with gain of integrin-binding function, intracellular signaling, and cell pro-adhesive activity. Finally, Cp aging in the CSF from Alzheimer disease patients, but not in control CSF, causes Cp deamidation with gain of integrin-binding function, suggesting that this transition might also occur in pathological conditions. In conclusion, both Cp NGR sites can deamidate during aging under oxidative conditions, likely as a consequence of oxidative-induced structural changes, thereby promoting a gain of function in integrin binding, signaling, and cell adhesion.  
24368194	Induction of sestrin2 as an endogenous protective mechanism against amyloid beta-peptide neurotoxicity in primary cortical culture.
Exp. Neurol. 20131222 2014Mar
Accumulation of amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) in senile plaques, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been implicated in neurodegeneration. Recent studies suggested sestrin2 as a crucial mediator for reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and autophagy regulation that both play a pivotal role in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases. However, the potential link between sestrin2 and AÎ² neurotoxicity has never been explored. The present study was therefore undertaken to test whether sestrin2 may be induced by AÎ² and its possible role in modulating AÎ² neurotoxicity. We showed that sestrin2 expression was elevated in primary rat cortical neurons upon AÎ² exposure; a heightened extent of sestrin2 expression was also detected in the cortices of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mice. Exposure of cortical neurons to AÎ² led to formation of LC3B-II, an autophagic marker; an increased LC3B-II level was also observed in the cortices of 12-month-old AD transgenic mice. More importantly, downregulation of sestrin2 by siRNA abolished LC3B-II formation caused by AÎ² that was accompanied by more severe neuronal death. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 also enhanced AÎ² neurotoxicity. Together, these results indicate that sestrin2 induced by AÎ² plays a protective role against AÎ² neurotoxicity through, at least in part, regulation of autophagy.  
24524367	A pilot study on the use of interferon beta-1a in early Alzheimer's disease subjects.
J Neuroinflammation 20140213 2014
Despite the fact that multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share common neuroimmunological features, interferon beta 1a (IFNÎ²1a), the well-established treatment for the prevention of disease progression and cognitive decline in MS patients, has never been used in AD. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of IFNÎ²1a in subjects affected by mild-to-moderate AD in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter pilot study. Forty-two early Alzheimer's patients were randomized to receive either a 22 mcg subcutaneous injection of IFNÎ²1a or placebo three times per week. A treatment period of 28 weeks was followed by 24 weeks of observation. IFNÎ²1a was well tolerated and adverse events were infrequent and mild to moderate. Although not statistically significant, a reduction in disease progression during follow-up was measured in IFNÎ²1a-treated patients by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale. Interestingly, the treatment group showed significant improvements in the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Physical Self-maintenance Scale. This study suggests that IFNÎ²1a is safe and well tolerated in early AD patients, and its possible beneficial role should be further investigated in larger studies. 
24565007	Preventing cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Opin Pharmacol 20131113 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease leading to cognitive decline, dementia, and ultimately death. Despite extensive R&amp;D efforts, there are no diseases modifying treatments for AD available. The stage in which patients receive a clinical diagnosis of probable AD may be too late for disease modifying pharmacotherapy. Prevention strategies may be required to successfully tackle AD. Preclinical AD applies to over half of all healthy elderly subjects and manifests by signs of amyloid deposition and/or neuronal injury in the brain, preceding the stage in which symptoms of dementia, cognitive and functional impairment become observable. Prevention trials in preclinical AD require longer and larger clinical trials using biomarkers and cognitive endpoints, which requires collaboration across academia, government and industry.  
24568356	Lipidomics of Alzheimer's disease.
Bioanalysis  2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disease that leads to an irreversible loss of neurons and cognition. It is the most common cause of dementia and can be considered as a major public health problem. At the histological level, AD is characterized by senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Numerous studies involving genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have been published in order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in AD, and to find new biomarkers. Metabolomics, and in particular lipidomics, have recently offered new possibilities due to the development of robust and sensitive analytical methods, such as LC-MS. This review aims to illustrate how lipidomics can help understand the biological mechanisms inherent to AD and how lipids can be considered as relevant biomarkers of AD at early stages. 
24463050	Association of LRRTM3 polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.
Exp. Gerontol. 20140121 2014Apr
The leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 3 (LRRTM3) has been defined as a positional and functional candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease. Recently, four novel variants (rs16923760, rs1925608, rs1925609 and rs10997477) within LRRTM3 were reported to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians. To evaluate the association of the LRRTM3 polymorphisms with LOAD in Asians, we performed a case-control study of 2287 unrelated subjects (1129 cases and 1158 age- and gender-matched controls) in Han Chinese. The rs10997477 T allele was significantly associated with a decreased risk of LOAD in APOE Îµ4 allele noncarriers (OR=0.750, PC&lt;0.001). Besides, the rs16923760 C allele significantly increased the risk of LOAD in APOE Îµ4 allele carriers (OR=1.837, PC&lt;0.001). The genotype distribution of rs1925609 polymorphism also significantly differed in APOE Îµ4 allele noncarriers (PC=0.008). Moreover, the association was further demonstrated in multivariate logistic regression analysis (rs10997477: Recessive model: OR=0.156, PC=0.004; Additive model: OR=0.731, PC&lt;0.001; rs16923760: Dominant model: OR=1.944, PC=0.024; Additive model: OR=1.885, PC&lt;0.001; Recessive model: OR=3.565, PC=0.010; rs1925609: Recessive model: OR=0.421, PC=0.024). As for rs1925608, we failed to detect any association with LOAD. This study firstly provides the independent evidence that the LRRTM3 polymorphisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of LOAD in a Northern Han Chinese population. However, additional independent replication groups are required to further validate this association.  
24599114	Reelin delays amyloid-beta fibril formation and rescues cognitive deficits in a model of Alzheimer's disease.
Nat Commun 20140306 2014
Reelin is an extracellular matrix protein that is crucial for neural development and adult brain plasticity. While the Reelin signalling cascade has been reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the role of Reelin in this pathology is not understood. Here we use an in vitro approach to show that Reelin interacts with amyloid-Î² (AÎ²42) soluble species, delays AÎ²42 fibril formation and is recruited into amyloid fibrils. Furthermore, Reelin protects against both the neuronal death and dendritic spine loss induced by AÎ²42 oligomers. In mice carrying the APP(Swe/Ind) mutation (J20 mice), Reelin overexpression delays amyloid plaque formation and rescues the recognition memory deficits. Our results indicate that by interacting with AÎ²42 soluble species, delaying AÎ² plaque formation, protecting against neuronal death and dendritic spine loss and preventing AD cognitive deficits, the Reelin pathway deserves consideration as a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD pathogenesis. 
24670442	[Î²-amyloid peptide deposition and expression of related miRNAs in the cerebellum of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease].
Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao  2014Mar
To investigate the presence of Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²) deposition in the cerebellum and the expression of related miRNAs in the cerebellum of a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. Twelve 12-month-old APPswe/PSÎ´E9 double transgenic mice and 12 wild-type C57 mice were sacrificed and the brain tissues were taken for examination. The right hemisphere was stained with Congo red to observe the deposition of amyloid substances, and from the left hemisphere, the hippocampus and the cerebellum were dissected for detecting the expression of miRNA-135a-5p, miRNA-298-5p, miRNA-466b-3p and miR-669f-3p using real-time PCR. Congo red staining revealed the presence of AÎ² deposition in both the hippocampus and the cerebellum of the transgenic mice but not in the control mice. Real-time PCR showed a significantly lower expression of the 4 miRNAs in the hippocampus in the transgenic mice than in the control mice (P&lt;0.05). The expression of miRNA-135a-5p, miRNA-298-5p, and miR-669f-3p in the cerebellum was significantly lower in the transgenic mice than in the control mice (P&lt;0.05). The expression of miRNA-298-5p and miR-669f-3p in the hippocampus was significantly lower than that in the cerebellum of the transgenic mice (P&lt;0.05). Î² deposition also occurs in the cerebellum of APPswe/PSÎ´E9 double transgenic mice, and its formation might be related to the down-regulation of miRNA-135a-5p, miRNA-298-5p, and miR-669f-3p. 
24524276	Mitochondrial oxygen consumption deficits in skeletal muscle isolated from an Alzheimer's disease-relevant murine model.
BMC Neurosci 20140213 2014
Age is considered a primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is also now well understood that mitochondrial function declines with age. Mitochondrial deficits have been previously assessed in brain from both human autopsy tissue and disease-relevant transgenic mice. Recently it has been recognized that abnormalities of muscle may be an intrinsic aspect of AD and might contribute to the pathophysiology. However, deficits in mitochondrial function have yet to be clearly assessed in tissues outside the central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, we utilized a well-characterized AD-relevant transgenic mouse strain to assess mitochondrial respiratory deficits in both brain and muscle. In addition to mitochondrial function, we assessed levels of transgene-derived amyloid precursor protein (APP) in homogenates isolated from brain and muscle of these AD-relevant animals. We now demonstrate that skeletal muscles isolated from these animals have differential levels of mutant full-length APP depending on muscle type. Additionally, isolated muscle fibers from young transgenic mice (3 months) have significantly decreased maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption capacity compared to non-transgenic, age-matched mice, with similar deficits to those previously described in brain. This is the first study to directly examine mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle from an AD-relevant transgenic murine model. As with brain, these deficits in muscle are an early event, occurring prior to appearance of amyloid plaques. 
23959532	Awareness of cognitive deficits and clinical competence in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: their relevance in clinical practice.
Neurol. Sci.  2014Mar
Awareness of cognitive deficits and clinical competence were investigated in 79 mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. Awareness was assessed by the anosognosia questionnaire for dementia, and clinical competence by specific neuropsychological tests such as trail making test-A, Babcock story recall test, semantic and phonemic verbal fluency. The findings show that 66 % of the patients were aware of memory deficits, while the 34 % were unaware. Deficit in awareness correlated with lower scores on the Mini Mental State Examination test that, in the score range from 24.51 to 30 and from 19.50 to 24.50, appeared to be a significant predictor of level of awareness. None of the AD patients had fully preserved clinical competence, only 7 patients (9 %) had partially preserved clinical competence and 72 patients (91 %) had completely lost clinical competence. All the patients with partially preserved clinical competence (9 %) were aware of their memory deficit. The study indicates that neuropsychological tests used for the assessment of executive functions are not suitable for investigating clinical competence. Therefore, additional and specific tools for the evaluation of clinical competence are necessary. Indeed, these might allow clinicians to identify AD patients who, despite their deficits in selected functions, retain their autonomy of choice as well as recognize those patients who should proceed to the nomination of a legal representative. 
23965131	Assessing accuracy of knowledge of cognitive effects of normal ageing and mild stage of Alzheimer's disease.
Aging Ment Health 20130821 2014
This study aimed to develop and pilot the Alzheimer's Disease and Ageing Perception Scale (ADAPS), examine theory-consistent differences and convergent validity, and identify misconceptions of the cognitive effects of ageing and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). After piloting a large pool of items with a panel of ageing and dementia experts (n = 6), an item analysis yielded a 25-item version of the ADAPS (Î± = .70), comprising a Normal Ageing subscale (Î± = .68) and Mild AD subscale (Î± = .74). Participants from the general community (n = 251) and aged care professionals (n = 59) completed the ADAPS, Knowledge of Memory Ageing Questionnaire (KMAQ), and the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). Compared to matched controls, aged care professionals demonstrated greater accuracy of knowledge on the Mild AD subscale (p &lt; .05), but not the Normal Ageing subscale (p &gt; .05) of the ADAPS. The pattern of significant correlations between the ADAPS, KMAQ, and ADKS supported the convergent validity of the ADAPS. The most common misconceptions on the ADAPS indicated a tendency for participants to overgeneralise the cognitive effects of normal ageing. This preliminary study introduces a new tool for assessing accuracy of knowledge of cognitive effects associated with normal ageing and mild AD, and may assist in identifying misconceptions of the ageing process. 
24356464	Measuring life space in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease using mobile phone GPS.
Gerontology 20131212 2014
As an indicator of physical and cognitive functioning in community-dwelling older adults, there is increasing interest in measuring life space, defined as the geographical area a person covers in daily life. Typically measured through questionnaires, life space can be challenging to assess in amnestic dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While global positioning system (GPS) technology has been suggested as a potential solution, there remains a lack of data validating GPS-based methods to measure life space in cognitively impaired populations. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the construct validity of a GPS system to provide quantitative measurements of global movement for individuals with mild-to-moderate AD. Nineteen community-dwelling older adults with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score 14-28, age 70.7 Â± 2.2 years) and 33 controls (CTL; age 74.0 Â± 1.2 years) wore a GPS-enabled mobile phone during the day for 3 days. Measures of geographical territory (area, perimeter, mean distance from home, and time away from home) were calculated from the GPS log. Following a log-transformation to produce symmetrical distributions, group differences were tested using two-sample t tests. Construct validity of the GPS measures was tested by examining the correlation between the GPS measures and indicators of physical function [steps/day, gait velocity, and Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)] and affective state (Apathy Evaluation Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale). Multivariate regression was performed to evaluate the relative strength of significantly correlated factors. GPS-derived area (p &lt; 0.01), perimeter (p &lt; 0.01), and mean distance from home (p &lt; 0.05) were smaller in the AD group compared to CTL. The correlation analysis found significant associations of the GPS measures area and perimeter with all measures of physical function (steps/day, DAD, and gait velocity; p &lt; 0.01), symptoms of apathy (p &lt; 0.01), and depression (p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that gait velocity and dependence were the strongest variables associated with GPS measures. This study demonstrated that GPS-derived area and perimeter: (1) distinguished mild-to-moderate AD patients from CTL and (2) were strongly correlated with physical function and affective state. These findings confirm the ability of GPS technology to assess life space behaviour and may be particularly valuable to continuously monitor functional decline associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as AD. 
24557039	Innate immune system and inflammation in Alzheimer's disease: from pathogenesis to treatment.
Neuroimmunomodulation 20140214 2014
Immune activation and inflammation, likely triggered by amyloid-beta (AÎ²) deposition, play a remarkable role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly. The principal cellular elements of the brain innate immune system likely to be involved in such processes are microglia. In an attempt to search for new disease-modifying drugs, the immune system has been addressed, with the aim of removing deposition of AÎ² or tau by developing vaccines and humanized monoclonal antibodies. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence regarding the role played by microglia and inflammatory molecules in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, we will discuss the main active and passive immunotherapeutic approaches. 
24558437	A systematic review of biomarkers for disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140218 2014
Using surrogate biomarkers for disease progression as endpoints in neuroprotective clinical trials may help differentiate symptomatic effects of potential neuroprotective agents from true slowing of the neurodegenerative process. A systematic review was undertaken to determine what biomarkers for disease progression in Alzheimer's disease exist and how well they perform. MEDLINE and Embase (1950-2011) were searched using five search strategies. Abstracts were assessed to identify papers meriting review in full. Studies of participants with probable Alzheimer's disease diagnosed by formal criteria were included. We made no restriction on age, disease duration, or drug treatment. We only included studies with a longitudinal design, in which the putative biomarker and clinical measure were both measured at least twice, as this is the only appropriate study design to use when developing a disease progression biomarker. We included studies which attempted to draw associations between the changes over time in the biomarker used to investigate disease progression and a clinical measure of disease progression. Fifty-nine studies were finally included. The commonest biomarker modality examined was brain MRI (17/59, 29% of included studies). Median follow-up in included studies was only 1.0 (IQR 0.8-1.7) year and most studies only measured the putative biomarker and clinical measure twice. Included studies were generally of poor quality with small numbers of participants (median 31 (IQR 17 to 64)), applied excessively restrictive study entry criteria, had flawed methodologies and conducted overly simplistic statistical analyses without adjusting for confounding factors. We found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any biomarker as an outcome measure for disease progression in Alzheimer's disease trials. However, further investigation into the efficacy of using MRI measurements of ventricular volume and whole brain volume appeared to be merited. A provisional 'roadmap' to improve the quality of future disease progression biomarker studies is presented. 
24558469	Meta-analysis of peripheral blood apolipoprotein E levels in Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140218 2014
Peripheral blood Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels have been proposed as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but previous studies on levels of ApoE in blood remain inconsistent. This meta-analysis was designed to re-examine the potential role of peripheral ApoE in AD diagnosis and its potential value as a candidate biomarker. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and BIOSIS previews for case-control studies measuring ApoE levels in serum or plasma from AD subjects and healthy controls. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate the association between ApoE levels and AD risk. Eight studies with a total of 2250 controls and 1498 AD cases were identified and analyzed. The pooled WMD from a random-effect model of AD participants compared with the healthy controls was -5.59 mg/l (95% CI: [-8.12, -3.06]). The overall pattern in WMD was not varied by characteristics of study, including age, country, assay method, publication year, and sample type. Our meta-analysis supports a lowered level of blood ApoE in AD patients, and indicates its potential value as an important risk factor for AD. Further investigation employing standardized assay for ApoE measurement are still warranted to uncover the precise role of ApoE in the pathophysiology of AD. 
24579083	Factors determining disease duration in Alzheimer's disease: a postmortem study of 103 cases using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regression.
Biomed Res Int 20140122 2014
Factors associated with duration of dementia in a consecutive series of 103 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases were studied using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regression analysis (proportional hazard model). Mean disease duration was 7.1 years (range: 6 weeks-30 years, standard deviationâ€‰=â€‰5.18); 25% of cases died within four years, 50% within 6.9 years, and 75% within 10 years. Familial AD cases (FAD) had a longer duration than sporadic cases (SAD), especially cases linked to presenilin (PSEN) genes. No significant differences in duration were associated with age, sex, or apolipoprotein E (Apo E) genotype. Duration was reduced in cases with arterial hypertension. Cox regression analysis suggested longer duration was associated with an earlier disease onset and increased senile plaque (SP) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in the orbital gyrus (OrG), CA1 sector of the hippocampus, and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). The data suggest shorter disease duration in SAD and in cases with hypertensive comorbidity. In addition, degree of neuropathology did not influence survival, but spread of SP/NFT pathology into the frontal lobe, hippocampus, and basal forebrain was associated with longer disease duration.  
24331706	Multimodal nanoprobes to target cerebrovascular amyloid in Alzheimer's disease brain.
Biomaterials 20131209 2014Feb
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) results from the accumulation of AÎ² proteins primarily within the media and adventitia of small arteries and capillaries of the cortex and leptomeninges. CAA affects a majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and is associated with a rapid decline in cognitive reserve. Unfortunately, there is no pre-mortem diagnosis available for CAA. Furthermore, treatment options are few and relatively ineffective. To combat this issue, we have designed nanovehicles (nanoparticles-IgG4.1) capable of targeting cerebrovascular amyloid (CVA) and serving as early diagnostic and therapeutic agents. These nanovehicles were loaded with Gadolinium (Gd) based (Magnevist(Â®)) magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) agents, such as (125)I. In addition, the nanovehicles carry either anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic agents such as curcumin or immunosuppressants such as dexamethasone, which were previously shown to reduce cerebrovascular inflammation. Owing to the anti-amyloid antibody (IgG4.1) grafted on the surface, the nanovehicles are capable of specifically targeting CVA deposits. The nanovehicles effectively marginate from the blood flow to the vascular wall as determined by using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technology. They demonstrate excellent distribution to the brain vasculature and target CVA, thus providing MRI and SPECT contrast specific to the CVA in the brain. In addition, they also display the potential to carry therapeutic agents to reduce cerebrovascular inflammation associated with CAA, which is believed to trigger hemorrhage in CAA patients.  
24438528	Genetic variants conferring susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease in the general population; do they also predispose to dementia in Down's syndrome.
BMC Res Notes 20140117 2014
Down's syndrome (DS) is caused by either complete or partial triplication of chromosome 21, affecting approximately 1/1000 live births, and it is widely accepted that individuals with DS are more likely to develop dementia of Alzheimer's disease (DAD) compared with the general population. Recent collaborative genome-wide association studies of large case control data sets of individuals with and without Alzhemier's disease (AD) have revealed new risk variants for dementia, as well as confirming previously identified risk variants. In this study, nine AD-derived SNPs, near or within the CR1 (rs3818361), BIN1 (rs744373), CD2AP (rs9349407), EPHA1 (rs11767557), CLU (rs1532278), MS4A6A/4A (rs610932), PICALM (rs561655), ABCA7 (rs3764650) and CD33 (rs3865444) genes were genotyped in 295 individuals with DS. There were no significant associations between these nine GWAS-derived SNPs and DAD in British Caucasian individuals with DS. Interestingly the CR1 rs3818361 variant appeared to be associated with mortality in our cohort, particularly in the subjects without dementia. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this variant has been implicated as a determinant of mortality and the finding warrants further investigation in other cohorts with DS. This study shows negative associations of nine AD-derived SNPs with DAD in DS. This may be due to the modest size of our cohort, which may indicate that our study is insufficiently powered to pick up such associations. We cannot conclusively exclude a role for these SNPs in DAD in DS. Clearly, efforts to investigate genetic variants with small effects on disease risk require a much larger cohort of individuals with DS. In fact, we hypothesize that a sample size of 4465 individuals with DS would be needed to determine the role in DAD in DS of the nine AD-derived SNPs investigated in this study. We therefore recommend that all national and international clinics with access to individuals with DS should contribute DNA samples to form DS consortia. 
24409936	To what extent does destination recall induce episodic reliving? Evidence from Alzheimer's disease.
J Clin Exp Neuropsychol 20140113 2014
We compared destination memory to source memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the latter type of memory is believed to be severely deteriorated in AD. Control participants and AD patients were tested on two conditions, both of which had a study phase and a recognition phase. In the study phase of the first condition, participants had to tell a set of facts to the faces of a set of celebrities (destination memory). In the study phase of the second condition, they had to receive a different set of facts from a different set of celebrity faces (source memory). During the recognition phase, participants had to indicate, for destination memory, whether they had previously told a given fact to a given face (yes) or not (no) and, for source memory, whether they had previously received a given fact from a given face (yes) or not (no). In both conditions, they were asked to choose between "remember" or "know" options when answering "yes." AD patients showed reliable difficulties in destination recall, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of "remember" responses they gave. AD-related destination memory decline may be attributed to the perturbation of episodic memory and its autonoetic reliving. The potential neural bases of this decline are discussed in terms of hippocampal failures.  
24199868	Single point mutations induce a switch in the molecular mechanism of the aggregation of the Alzheimer's disease associated AÎ²42 peptide.
ACS Chem. Biol. 20131125 2014Feb21
Single point mutations in the Alzheimer's disease associated AÎ²42 peptide are found to alter significantly its neurotoxic properties in vivo and have been associated with early onset forms of this devastating condition. We show that such mutations can induce structural changes in AÎ²42 fibrils and are associated with a dramatic switch in the fibril-dependent mechanism by which AÎ²42 aggregates. These observations reveal how subtle perturbations to the physicochemical properties of the AÎ² peptide, and the structural properties of fibrils that it forms, can have profound effects on the mechanism of its aggregation and pathogenicity.  
24597901	Effects of curcuminoids identified in rhizomes of Curcuma longa on BACE-1 inhibitory and behavioral activity and lifespan of Alzheimer's disease Drosophila models.
BMC Complement Altern Med 20140305 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of presenile and senile dementia. The human Î²-amyloid precursor cleavage enzyme (BACE-1) is a key enzyme responsible for amyloid plaque production, which implicates the progress and symptoms of AD. Here we assessed the anti-BACE-1 and behavioral activities of curcuminoids from rhizomes of Curcuma longa (Zingiberaceae), diarylalkyls curcumin (CCN), demethoxycurcumin (DMCCN), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMCCN) against AD Drosophila melanogaster models. Neuro-protective ability of the curcuminoids was assessed using Drosophila melanogaster model system overexpressing BACE-1 and its substrate APP in compound eyes and entire neurons. Feeding and climbing activity, lifespan, and morphostructural changes in fly eyes also were evaluated. BDMCCN has the strongest inhibitory activity toward BACE-1 with 17Â Î¼M IC50, which was 20 and 13 times lower than those of CCN and DMCCN respectively. Overexpression of APP/BACE-1 resulted in the progressive and measurable defects in morphology of eyes and locomotion. Remarkably, supplementing diet with either 1Â mM BDMCCN or 1Â mM CCN rescued APP/BACE1-expressing flies and kept them from developing both morphological and behavioral defects. Our results suggest that structural characteristics, such as degrees of saturation, types of carbon skeleton and functional group, and hydrophobicity appear to play a role in determining inhibitory potency of curcuminoids on BACE-1. Further studies will warrant possible applications of curcuminoids as therapeutic BACE-1 blockers. 
24366666	cdc-like/dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases inhibitor leucettine L41 induces mTOR-dependent autophagy: implication for Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Pharmacol. 20131223 2014Mar
Leucettines, a family of pharmacological inhibitors of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinases and cdc-like kinases (CLKs), are currently under investigation for their potential therapeutic application to Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. We here report that leucettine L41 triggers bona fide autophagy in osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells and immortalized mouse hippocampal HT22 cells, characterized by microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 membrane translocation and foci formation. Leucettine L41-triggered autophagy requires the Unc-51-like kinase and is sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin and 3-methyladenine, suggesting that it acts through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/PI3K-dependent pathway. Leucettine L41 does not act by modifying the autophagic flux of vesicles. Leucettine L41-induced autophagy correlates best with inhibition of CLKs. Leucettine L41 modestly inhibited phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase, FYVE domain-containing activity as tested both in vitro and in vivo, which may also contribute to autophagy induction. Altogether these results demonstrate that leucettines can activate the autophagic mTOR/PI3K pathway, a characteristic that may turn advantageous in the context of Alzheimer's disease treatment.  
24415571	Satiety-related hormonal dysregulation in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.
Neurology 20140110 2014Feb11
To investigate whether patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) have dysregulation in satiety-related hormonal signaling using a laboratory-based case-control study. Fifty-four participants (19 patients with bvFTD, 17 patients with Alzheimer disease dementia, and 18 healthy normal controls [NCs]) were recruited from a tertiary-care dementia clinic. During a standardized breakfast, blood was drawn before, during, and after the breakfast protocol to quantify levels of peripheral satiety-related hormones (ghrelin, cortisol, insulin, leptin, and peptide YY) and glucose. To further explore the role of patients' feeding abnormalities on hormone levels, patients were classified into overeating and nonovereating subgroups based on feeding behavior during separate laboratory-based standardized lunch feeding sessions. Irrespective of their feeding behavior in the laboratory, patients with bvFTD, but not patients with Alzheimer disease dementia, have significantly lower levels of ghrelin and cortisol and higher levels of insulin compared with NCs. Furthermore, while laboratory feeding behavior did not predict alterations in levels of ghrelin, cortisol, and insulin, only patients with bvFTD who significantly overate in the laboratory demonstrated significantly higher levels of leptin compared with NCs, suggesting that leptin may be sensitive to particularly severe feeding abnormalities in bvFTD. Despite a tendency to overeat, patients with bvFTD have a hormonal profile that should decrease food intake. Aberrant hormone levels may represent a compensatory response to the behavioral or neuroanatomical abnormalities of bvFTD. 
24529521	How does brain insulin resistance develop in Alzheimer's disease?
Alzheimers Dement  2014Feb
Compelling preclinical and clinical evidence supports a pathophysiological connection between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes. Altered metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance are key pathological features of both diseases. For many years, it was generally considered that the brain was insensitive to insulin, but it is now accepted that this hormone has central neuromodulatory functions, including roles in learning and memory, that are impaired in AD. However, until recently, the molecular mechanisms accounting for brain insulin resistance in AD have remained elusive. Here, we review recent evidence that sheds light on how brain insulin dysfunction is initiated at a molecular level and why abnormal insulin signaling culminates in synaptic failure and memory decline. We also discuss the cellular basis underlying the beneficial effects of stimulation of brain insulin signaling on cognition. Discoveries summarized here provide pathophysiological background for identification of novel molecular targets and for development of alternative therapeutic approaches in AD. 
24529523	First clinical data of the neuroprotective effects of nasal insulin application in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Feb
Previous reviews have outlined the important role of insulin in the brain, and the observation that insulin signaling is desensitized in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because insulin is used to treat diabetes and insulin desensitization in the periphery, this motivated the design and execution of clinical pilot trials in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment. Because insulin has powerful effects on blood sugar levels, a new technique was used by which insulin is applied as a spray. This method avoids high levels of insulin in the periphery and makes use of the transport system, via the nasal epithelium, into the brain. First trials in healthy subjects showed improvement in attention and memory tasks, and confirmed the concept that insulin signaling plays an important role in neuronal function and cognition. In a series of small clinical trials in patients with mild cognitive impairment/AD, nasal application of insulin or long-lasting insulin analogs showed improvements in memory tasks, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and in a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic study. In a more recent trial, two patient subgroups were identified, in which the insulin-resistant group improved after drug treatment whereas a subgroup that did not show insulin desensitization deteriorated. This highlights the need to conduct additional studies and demonstrates clearly that the hypothesis that insulin signaling plays in important role in cognition and AD has merit, and that this is a worthwhile target that shows great promise for future drug developments that improve insulin signaling. Insulin itself may not be the best choice, and other drugs that have been developed to treat diabetes that do not enhance insulin desensitization may be a better choice.  
24529525	The incretin hormones glucagonlike peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are neuroprotective in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Feb
The incretin hormones glucagonlike peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes and also act as growth factors. We have tested several long-acting incretin mimetics in the amyloid precursor protein (APP)(Swe)/presenilin 1 (PS1)(Î”E9) model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that liraglutide, lixisenatide, and D-Ala2-GIP cross the blood-brain barrier and prevent the impairment in memory formation and synaptic plasticity, increase synapse numbers, reduce amyloid plaque load and soluble amyloid-Î² levels, reduce oxidative stress and the chronic inflammation response in the brain, enhance the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells, and increase neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. In an (18)fluorodeoxyglucoe positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic imaging study in PLB1-triple mice, a mouse model that expresses human mutated APP, PS1, and tau proteins, glucose metabolism was found to be normalized in forebrain areas after liraglutide treatment, demonstrating that neuronal metabolic activity was normalized. A clinical trial testing liraglutide in patients with AD is currently ongoing. 
24529528	Inflammation, defective insulin signaling, and neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimers Dement  2014Feb
A link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and metabolic disorders has been established, with patients with type 2 diabetes at increased risk of developing AD and vice versa. The incidence of metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is increasing at alarming rates worldwide, primarily as a result of poor lifestyle habits. In parallel, as the world population ages, the prevalence of AD, the most common form of dementia in the elderly, also increases. In addition to their epidemiologic and clinical association, mounting recent evidence indicates shared mechanisms of pathogenesis between metabolic disorders and AD. We discuss the concept that peripheral and central nervous system inflammation link the pathogenesis of AD and metabolic diseases. We also explore the contribution of brain inflammation to defective insulin signaling and neuronal dysfunction. Last, we review recent evidence indicating that targeting neuroinflammation may provide novel therapeutic avenues for AD. 
24270002	Proteasome inhibition induces stress kinase dependent transport deficits--implications for Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 20131121 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of two misfolded and aggregated proteins, Î²-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau. Both cellular systems responsible for clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins, the lysosomal and the proteasomal, have been shown to be malfunctioning in the aged brain and more so in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. This malfunction could be contributing to Î²-amyloid and tau accumulation, eventually aggregating in plaques and tangles. We have investigated the impact of decreased proteasome activity on tau phosphorylation as well as on microtubule stability and transport. To do this, we used our recently developed neuronal model where human SH-SY5Y cells obtain neuronal morphology and function through differentiation. We found that exposure to low doses of the proteasome inhibitor MG-115 caused tau phosphorylation, microtubule destabilization and disturbed neuritic transport. Furthermore, reduced proteasome activity activated several proteins implicated in tau phosphorylation and AD pathology, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, c-Jun and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2. Restoration of the microtubule transport was achieved by inhibiting ERK 1/2 activation, and simultaneous inhibition of both ERK 1/2 and c-Jun reversed the proteasome inhibition-induced tau phosphorylation. Taken together, this study suggests that a decrease in proteasome activity can, through activation of c-Jun and ERK 1/2, result in several events related to neurodegenerative diseases. Restoration of proteasome activity or modulation of ERK 1/2 and c-Jun function can open new treatment possibilities against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.  
24246047	Atomic and dynamic insights into the beneficial effect of the 1,4-naphthoquinon-2-yl-L-tryptophan inhibitor on Alzheimer's AÎ²1-42 dimer in terms of aggregation and toxicity.
ACS Chem Neurosci 20131122 2014Feb19
Aggregation of the amyloid Î² protein (AÎ²) peptide with 40 or 42 residues is one key feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 1,4-naphthoquinon-2-yl-L-tryptophan (NQTrp) molecule was reported to alter AÎ² self-assembly and reduce toxicity. Though nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and various simulations provided atomic information about the interaction of NQTrp with AÎ² peptides spanning the regions of residues 12-28 and 17-42, none of these studies were conducted on the full-length AÎ²1-42 peptide. To this end, we performed extensive atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of AÎ²1-42 dimer with two NQTrp molecules in explicit solvent, by using a force field known to fold diverse proteins correctly. The interactions between NQTrp and AÎ²1-42, which change the AÎ² interface by reducing most of the intermolecular contacts, are found to be very dynamic and multiple, leading to many transient binding sites. The most favorable binding residues are Arg5, Asp7, Tyr10, His13, Lys16, Lys18, Phe19/Phe20, and Leu34/Met35, providing therefore a completely different picture from in vitro and in silico experiments with NQTrp with shorter AÎ² fragments. Importantly, the 10 hot residues that we identified explain the beneficial effect of NQTrp in reducing both the level of AÎ²1-42 aggregation and toxicity. Our results also indicate that there is room to design more efficient drugs targeting AÎ²1-42 dimer against AD. 
24328060	Flavonoids as therapeutic compounds targeting key proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease.
ACS Chem Neurosci 20140103 2014Feb19
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by pathological aggregation of protein tau and amyloid-Î² peptides, both of which are considered to be toxic to neurons. Naturally occurring dietary flavonoids have received considerable attention as alternative candidates for Alzheimer's therapy taking into account their antiamyloidogenic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties. Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that certain flavonoids may protect against Alzheimer's disease in part by interfering with the generation and assembly of amyloid-Î² peptides into neurotoxic oligomeric aggregates and also by reducing tau aggregation. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the ability of flavonoids to prevent the onset or to slow the progression of the disease. Some mechanisms include their interaction with important signaling pathways in the brain like the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways that regulate prosurvival transcription factors and gene expression. Other processes include the disruption of amyloid-Î² aggregation and alterations in amyloid precursor protein processing through the inhibition of Î²-secretase and/or activation of Î±-secretase, and inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² activation, preventing abnormal tau phosphorylation. The interaction of flavonoids with different signaling pathways put forward their therapeutic potential to prevent the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and to promote cognitive performance. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to give additional insight into the specific mechanisms by which flavonoids exert their potential neuroprotective actions in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients.  
24481173	A canine model of Alzheimer's disease generated by overexpressing a mutated human amyloid precursor protein.
Int. J. Mol. Med. 20140128 2014Apr
Canines are considered the most authentic model for studying multifactorial human diseases, as these animals typically share a common environment with man. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology along with genetic engineering of nuclear donor cells provides a unique opportunity for examining human diseases using transgenic canines. In the present study, we generated transgenic canines that overexpressed the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene containing well-characterized familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutations. We successfully obtained five out of six live puppies by SCNT. This was confirmed by observing the expression of green fluorescence protein in the body as a visual transgenic marker and the overexpression of the mutated APP gene in the brain. The transgenic canines developed AD-like symptoms, such as enlarged ventricles, an atrophied hippocampus, and Î²-amyloid plaques in the brain. Thus, the transgenic canines we created can serve as a novel animal model for studying human AD.  
24551135	Combining PET images and neuropsychological test data for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140213 2014
In recent years, several approaches to develop computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for dementia have been proposed. Some of these systems analyze neurological brain images by means of machine learning algorithms in order to find the patterns that characterize the disorder, and a few combine several imaging modalities to improve the diagnostic accuracy. However, they usually do not use neuropsychological testing data in that analysis. The purpose of this work is to measure the advantages of using not only neuroimages as data source in CAD systems for dementia but also neuropsychological scores. To this aim, we compared the accuracy rates achieved by systems that use neuropsychological scores beside the imaging data in the classification step and systems that use only one of these data sources. In order to address the small sample size problem and facilitate the data combination, a dimensionality reduction step (implemented using three different algorithms) was also applied on the imaging data. After each image is summarized in a reduced set of image features, the data sources were combined and classified using three different data combination approaches and a Support Vector Machine classifier. That way, by testing different dimensionality reduction methods and several data combination approaches, we aim not only highlighting the advantages of using neuropsychological scores in the classification, but also implementing the most accurate computer system for early dementia detention. The accuracy of the CAD systems were estimated using a database with records from 46 subjects, diagnosed with MCI or AD. A peak accuracy rate of 89% was obtained. In all cases the accuracy achieved using both, neuropsychological scores and imaging data, was substantially higher than the one obtained using only the imaging data.  
24085249	Registration of Alzheimer's disease in Taiwan: patient and informant.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131001 2014Feb
To obtain updated data of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their informants in Taiwan with the aim of fostering and supporting collaborative research. In total, 691 patients with the diagnosis of AD were recruited at 6 sites in Taiwan. The Uniform Data Set (UDS; form A) was administrated. The mean age of the patients with AD was 79.3 Â± 7.7 years and the mean age of informants was 57.5 Â± 13.7 years. In all, 69% of the informants lived with patients and 77% of patients lived with spouse, partner, or children; 11% had 1 sibling with dementia, 1.8% had 2 siblings with dementia, and 0.5% had 3 or more siblings with dementia. We have reported the updated status of AD in Taiwan through a UDS that will foster future collaboration among countries using UDS. The updated information of patients with AD and their informants will direct the future care of AD in Taiwan. 
24085254	Hippocampal and mesial temporal sclerosis in early-onset frontotemporal lobar degeneration versus Alzheimer's disease.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131001 2014Feb
Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) may occur with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as with normal aging. Prior studies suggest that HS/MTS may be more closely associated with FTLD but have not directly compared the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HS/MTS between neuropathologically confirmed early-onset (age â‰¤ 65) cohorts of FTLD and AD. We identified patients with early-onset FTLD (n = 136) and AD (n = 267) from National Alzheimer's Center Consortium databases and compared neuropathological and clinical data between these 2 groups. The FTLD group had a significantly higher prevalence of HS/MTS than that of the AD group. However, HS/MTS was associated with increasing age and memory impairment in the AD group but not in the FTLD group. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that HS/MTS in FTLD occurs as part of the primary pathological process, rather than as a secondary, nonspecific effect of aging on memory and hippocampal function.  
24085256	The bedford Alzheimer nursing-severity scale to assess dementia severity in advanced dementia: a nonparametric item response analysis and a study of its psychometric characteristics.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131001 2014Feb
The Bedford Alzheimer Nursing-Severity Scale (BANS-S) assesses disease severity in patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease. Since Alzheimer is a progressive disease, studying the hierarchy of the items in the scale can be useful to evaluate the progression of the disease. Data from 164 Alzheimer's patients and 186 patients with other dementia were analyzed using the Mokken Scaling Methodology to determine whether respondents can be ordered in the trait dementia severity, and to study whether an ordering between the items exist. The scalability of the scale was evaluated by the H coefficient. Results showed that the BANS-S is a reliable and medium scale (0.4â‰¤H&lt;0.5) for the Alzheimer group. All items with the exception of the item about mobility could be ordered. When later item was eliminated from the scale, the H coefficient decreased indicating that the scalability of the scale in the original form is more accurate than in the shorter version. For the other dementia group, the BANS-S did not fit any of the Mokken Scaling models because the scale was not unidimensional. In this group, a shorter version of the scale without the sleeping cycle item and the mobility item has better reliability and scalability properties than the original scale.  
24164932	Serum trace metal levels in Alzheimer's disease and normal control groups.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131027 2014Feb
To determine whether serum trace metals are related to abnormal cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied serum lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and arsenic(As) in 89 patients with AD and in 118 cognitively normal individuals. We analyzed the results of the blood tests and the food intake. Serum Pb levels correlated with word list recall (P = .039) and word list recognition (P = .037). Without age adjustment, serum Cd levels (P = .044) were significantly higher in the AD group. After stratified age adjustment, the levels of selected trace metals did not differ significantly between AD and normal individuals. Food intakes regarding selected trace metals were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In this study, serum Pb, Cd, Hg, and As levels were not directly related to abnormal cognition in AD. Serum Pb levels were significantly negatively correlated with verbal memory scores. 
24164934	Global long interspersed nuclear element 1 DNA methylation in a colombian sample of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131027 2014Feb
Alterations in DNA methylation have implicated as an epigenetic event in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The objective of this work was to evaluate global DNA methylation levels for long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) repetitive sequences in Colombian patients with LOAD and controls. The LINE-1 DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood samples from 28 Colombian patients with LOAD and 30 healthy participants were assessed using a methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) quantitative assay. We did not find differences in LINE-1 methylation levels between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD; median 76.2%, interquartile range [IQR]: 69.8-81.9) and control participants (median 79.8%, IQR: 73.2-83.8; P = .3). Additional stratified analyses did not show differences in LINE-1 methylation levels for male or female patients versus controls nor for apolipoprotein E4 carriers and noncarriers. This is the first report of LINE-1 methylation levels in patients with LOAD using the cost-effective MS-HRM technique, and this is the first global DNA methylation study in Latin American patients with AD.  
24277910	Cerebrospinal fluid apolipoprotein e concentration and severity of cognitive impairment in patients with newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131124 2014Feb
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Altered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels have been previously reported in patients with AD. We hypothesized that CSF apoE levels of patients with newly diagnosed AD might be associated with their cognitive performance. Patients with AD (N = 71) enrolled into an observational study underwent neuropsychological testing (Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD [CERAD] plus) at time of diagnosis. The CSF was obtained, and apoE concentrations were determined. Generalized linear models were constructed to assess the associations of apoE and neuropsychological measures while adjusting for important potential confounders. No association of CSF apoE levels and cognitive function could be demonstrated. Still, the use of neuroleptic drugs, female gender, preprogression time, and lower education were linked to worse cognitive function in some domains. The CSF apoE appears not to be suitable as a biochemical surrogate of cognitive function in AD under the given circumstances. By means of longitudinal analyses, potential associations with the velocity of decline will be investigated in the near future. 
24381135	Related genes and potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: a preliminary study based on DNA microarray.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 20131230 2014Feb
The aim of this study is to extend our understanding of the molecular mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We downloaded the gene expression profile GSE18309 from Gene Expression Omnibus database, which includes 3 genechips from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 3 genechips from patients with AD, and 3 genechips from normal controls (NC). Linear Models for Microarray Data package was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MCI versus NC group and AD versus NC group. Then, we extracted the overlapping DEGs of 2 groups for functional and pathway enrichment analysis using FuncAssociate software accompanied by gene ontology and expressing analysis systematic explorer, respectively. Further, AutoDock4 (http://autodock.scripps.edu/) was used to predict the docking site between small molecule ligands and proteins of a key DEG. A total of 60 DEGs were identified. Biological processes associated with nutrient response and muscle development were significantly dysregulated in AD and MCI. In addition, we identified 2 active binding sites (A5 and L30) on protein structure of cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) for drug design. The DEGs including CCKAR might be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. However, further experimental studies are needed to confirm our results. 
24554143	Serum folic acid and RFC A80G polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen  2014Feb
Low level of vitamin B12 and folic acid has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). Serum folic acid and vitamin B12 were assayed in 80 AD and 50 VaD cases and in 120 healthy controls. The reduced folate carrier (RFC1) gene, rs1051266, which encodes the RFC 1, protein was analyzed for polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. It was observed that the patients having folic acid &lt;8.45 ng/mL had 2.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-4.5) times higher odds of having AD and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.2) times higher odds of having VaD than patients having folic acid â‰¥8.45 ng/mL. Serum vitamin B12 level did not show any such statistically significant effect in altering the odds. No direct association was found between variant (G) allele or genotype of rs1051266 with AD and VaD cases. On serum folate level no association was observed with gene polymorphism.  
24672477	Targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms with polyphenols for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease-experimental approach and therapeutic implications.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140314 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging and currently has no cure. Its onset and progression are influenced by multiple factors. There is growing consensus that successful treatment will rely on simultaneously targeting multiple pathological features of AD. Polyphenol compounds have many proven health benefits. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that combining three polyphenolic preparations (grape seed extract, resveratrol, and Concord grape juice extract), with different polyphenolic compositions and partially redundant bioactivities, may simultaneously and synergistically mitigate amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) mediated neuropathology and cognitive impairments in a mouse model of AD. We found that administration of the polyphenols in combination did not alter the profile of bioactive polyphenol metabolites in the brain. We also found that combination treatment resulted in better protection against cognitive impairments compared to individual treatments, in J20 AD mice. Electrophysiological examination showed that acute treatment with select brain penetrating polyphenol metabolites, derived from these polyphenols, improved oligomeric AÎ² (oAÎ²)-induced long term potentiation (LTP) deficits in hippocampal slices. Moreover, we found greatly reduced total amyloid content in the brain following combination treatment. Our studies provided experimental evidence that application of polyphenols targeting multiple disease-mechanisms may yield a greater likelihood of therapeutic efficacy.  
24678299	Biomarker-based diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease: how and what to tell. A kickstart to an ethical discussion.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140319 2014
New criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on biomarker results have recently been developed and are currently undergoing extensive validation. The next few years may represent a time window where the diagnostic validity of biomarkers will be studied in highly specialized research settings. Biomarkers results will be used to direct clinical diagnosis and, whenever appropriate, therapy and management. This piece aims to stimulate discussion by identifying the ethical challenges involved in the use of biomarkers to make a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment due to AD and disclose it to patients. At the individual level, these challenges are related to (i) the ethical appropriateness of implementing an ecological diagnostic research protocol, (ii) the related informed consent process, and (iii) the diagnostic disclosure. We justify the ethical legitimacy of implementing a research diagnostic protocol by referring to the respect of patients' subjectivity and autonomy, and we suggest guidelines for informed consent development and diagnostic disclosure. All of the above points are discussed in light of the unique features of AD, currently scanty treatment options, and knowledge and uncertainties regarding the diagnostic value of biomarkers.  
24678498	Treadmill exercise improves short-term memory by enhancing neurogenesis in amyloid beta-induced Alzheimer disease rats.
J Exerc Rehabil 20140228 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative disorders, and this disease is characterized by severe memory impairment and decline of cognition. Hippocampal neurons are vulnerable to injury induced by Alzheimer's disease. Physical exercise is known to promote cell survival and functional recovery after brain injuries. In the present study, we investigated the effects of treadmill exercise on short-term memory in relation with neurogenesis in the rats with amyloid Î²25-35 (AÎ²25-35)-induced Alzheimer's disease. The rat model of Alzheimer's disease was induced by the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of AÎ²25-35, using a stereotaxic instrument. The rats in the exercise group were forced to run on a treadmill for 30 min once daily for 4 consecutive weeks, starting 2 days after AÎ²25-35 injection. Presently, short-term memory was deteriorated and apical dendritic length in the hippocampus was shortened in the hippocampus by AÎ²25-35 injection. In contrast, treadmill exercise alleviated memory impairment and increased apical dendritic length in the AÎ²25-35-injected rats. Neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotorphic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase B (trkB) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were decreased by AÎ²25-35 injection. Treadmill exercise increased neurogenesis and expressions of BDNF and trkB expressions. The present study shows that treadmill exercise may provide therapeutic value for the alleviating symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.  
24240737	Staging TDP-43 pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Neuropathol. 20131116 2014Mar
TDP-43 immunoreactivity occurs in 19-57 % of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. Two patterns of TDP-43 deposition in AD have been described involving hippocampus (limbic) or hippocampus and neocortex (diffuse), although focal amygdala involvement has been observed. In 195 AD cases with TDP-43, we investigated regional TDP-43 immunoreactivity with the aim of developing a TDP-43 in AD staging scheme. TDP-43 immunoreactivity was assessed in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, hippocampal dentate gyrus, occipitotemporal, inferior temporal and frontal cortices, and basal ganglia. Clinical, neuroimaging, genetic and pathological characteristics were assessed across stages. Five stages were identified: stage I showed scant-sparse TDP-43 in the amygdala only (17 %); stage II showed moderate-frequent amygdala TDP-43 with spread into entorhinal and subiculum (25 %); stage III showed further spread into dentate gyrus and occipitotemporal cortex (31 %); stage IV showed further spread into inferior temporal cortex (20 %); and stage V showed involvement of frontal cortex and basal ganglia (7 %). Cognition and medial temporal volumes differed across all stages and progression across stages correlated with worsening cognition and medial temporal volume loss. Compared to 147 AD patients without TDP-43, only the Boston Naming Test showed abnormalities in stage I. The findings demonstrate that TDP-43 deposition in AD progresses in a stereotypic manner that can be divided into five distinct topographic stages which are supported by correlations with clinical and neuroimaging features. Given these findings, we recommend sequential regional TDP-43 screening in AD beginning with the amygdala. 
24252390	On the origin of Alzheimer's disease. Trials and tribulations of the amyloid hypothesis.
Ageing Res. Rev. 20131116 2014Jan
The amyloid cascade hypothesis, which implicates the amyloid AÎ² peptide as the pathological initiator of both familial and sporadic, late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), continues to guide the majority of research. We believe that current evidence does not support the amyloid cascade hypothesis for late onset AD. Instead, we propose that AÎ² is a key regulator of brain homeostasis. During AD, while AÎ² accumulation may occur in the long term in parallel with disease progression, it does not contribute to primary pathogenesis. This view predicts that amyloid-centric therapies will continue to fail, and that progress in developing successful alternative therapies for AD will be slow until closer attention is paid to understanding the physiological function of AÎ² and its precursor protein.  
24269312	The behavioral, pathological and therapeutic features of the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 strain as an Alzheimer's disease animal model.
Ageing Res. Rev. 20131121 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread and devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease. Disease-modifying treatments remain beyond reach, and the etiology of the disease is uncertain. Animal model are essential for identifying disease mechanisms and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Research on AD is currently being carried out in rodent models. The most common transgenic mouse model mimics familial AD, which accounts for a small percentage of cases. The senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) strain is a spontaneous animal model of accelerated aging. Many studies indicate that SAMP8 mice harbor the behavioral and histopathological signatures of AD, namely AD-like cognitive and behavioral alterations, neuropathological phenotypes (neuron and dendrite spine loss, spongiosis, gliosis and cholinergic deficits in the forebrain), Î²-amyloid deposits resembling senile plaques, and aberrant hyperphosphorylation of Tau-like neurofibrillary tangles. SAMP8 mice are useful in the development of novel therapies, and many pharmacological agents and approaches are effective in SAMP8 mice. SAMP8 mice are considered a robust model for exploring the etiopathogenesis of sporadic AD and a plausible experimental model for developing preventative and therapeutic treatments for late-onset/age-related AD, which accounts for the vast majority of cases.  
24132937	Neuronal and glial alterations, increased anxiety, and cognitive impairment before hippocampal amyloid deposition in PDAPP mice, model of Alzheimer's disease.
Hippocampus 20131112 2014Mar
In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), hippocampal alterations have been well described in advanced stages of the pathology, when amyloid deposition, inflammation and glial activation occur, but less attention has been directed to studying early brain and behavioral changes. Using an animal model of AD, the transgenic PDAPP-J20 mouse at 5 months of age, when no amyloid plaques are present and low cerebral levels of amyloid peptides are detectable, we found structural, morphological, and cellular alterations in the hippocampus. Young transgenic mice showed a reduced hippocampal volume with less number of pyramidal and granular neurons, which additionally exhibited cell atrophy. The neurogenic capability in this zone, measured as DCX+ cells, was strongly diminished and associated to alterations in cell maturity. A decrease in presynaptic synaptophysin optical density was detected in mossy fibers reaching CA3 subfield but not in Golgi stained- CA1 dendritic spine density. Employing confocal microscopy and accurate stereological tools we also found a reduction in the number of GFAP+ cells, along with decreased astrocyte complexity, suggesting a potential detriment of neural support. According with untimely neuroglial alterations, young PDAPP mice failed in the novel location recognition test, that depends on hippocampal function. Moreover, multivariate statistical analysis of the behavioral outcome in the open-field test evidenced an elevated anxiety score in Tg mice compared with age-matched control mice. In line with this, the transgenic group showed a higher number of c-Fos+ nuclei in central and basolateral amygdala, a result that supports the early involvement of the emotionality factor in AD pathology. Applying an integrative approach, this work focuses on early structural, morphological and functional changes and provides new and compelling evidence of behavioral alterations that precede manifest AD. 
24254700	Feasibility of lumbar puncture in the study of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: a multicenter study in Spain.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Lumbar puncture (LP) is increasingly performed in memory units due to the usefulness of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The feasibility of this procedure in this context, however, is controversial. Our aim was to analyze the incidence of complications and their associated factors so as to determine the impact of LP in the study of CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. In the context of a larger international initiative, we prospectively collected data from 689 participants who underwent LP in three memory units in Spain. Data included demographic factors, headache history, subjective attitude toward the procedure, patient positioning, needle characteristics, volume of CSF extracted, attempts needed, and resting time after CSF acquisition. Five to seven days after the procedure, we asked participants about complications through a semi-structured telephone interview. No adverse events were reported in 441 (64.0%) participants. The most frequent complication was headache, reported by 171 (24.8%) subjects. It was severe in only 17 (2.5%). Headache was more frequent in younger participants and when a cutting-edge needle was used. Back pain was present in 111 (16.1%) cases, and it was associated with female gender, cutting-edge needles, increased number of attempts, and longer resting time after LP. No major complications were reported. The use of pen-point needles showed a trend toward a higher frequency of hematic CSF. LP can be safely performed to study CSF biomarkers. The main complication is headache, associated with younger age and use of cutting-edge needles. 
24254703	GSK3 in Alzheimer's disease: mind the isoforms.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Understanding the molecular signaling pathways that go awry in Alzheimer's disease (AD) would provide insights into developing novel therapies for this devastating neurodegenerative disease. Previous work has established that hyperactive glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is linked to both "sporadic" and "genetic" forms of AD, suggesting a crucial role of GSK3 in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of GSK3 activity has been intensely investigated as a potential therapeutic intervention for AD. GSK3 exists in two isoforms: GSK3Î± and GSK3Î². Markedly, recent studies indicate specific contributions of each of the Î± and Î² isoforms of GSK3 to AD pathogenesis, suggesting a role of both isoforms in the disease. Here I review recent relevant work investigating isoform-specific roles of GSK3 in AD pathophysiology, highlighting the emerging role of GSK3Î±, which has been largely overlooked in favor of the more extensive studies of GSK3Î². 
24270206	Alteration of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Oxidative stress has an important role in the pathological process of most neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The glutaredoxin (Grx) and thioredoxin (Trx) systems are central in maintaining a reduced environment in the cell and thus render protection against oxidative stress. Here, we show that Trx1 and Grx1 were released to the cerebrospinal fluid in 120 cases examined, and that the levels of these proteins increased significantly in the early stages of AD in comparison to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Trx1 and Grx1 levels correlated with the established AD biomarkers tau and phospho-tau (p-tau). Moreover, by determining the levels of Trx1 and Grx1, discrimination between MCI converters and patients with stable MCI were possible. By applying the protein levels of Trx1 together with conventional diagnostic markers (Mini-Mental State Examination, tau, and p-tau) to a stepwise regression model, MCI stable, MCI converter, mild AD, and moderate AD was correctly diagnosed in 32 out of 33 cases. In order to further evaluate the involvement of these systems in AD, the immunoreactivity of Trx1, Trx2, Grx1, and Grx2 were investigated and the expression pattern was shown to be altered in hippocampus tissue sections from AD patients compared to controls. In conclusion, we introduce members of the thioredoxin super family of proteins as promising early biomarkers in the diagnosis of AD, suggesting their potential involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease. 
24284368	The new Qualitative Scoring MMSE Pentagon Test (QSPT) as a valid screening tool between autopsy-confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Visual-constructional apraxia is a prominent feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) that might help to clinically distinguish it from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main goal of this study was to assess performance on the copy intersecting-pentagon item of the Mini-Mental State Examination with the new Qualitative Scoring method for the Pentagon copy Test (QSPT). In order to determine which aspects of the drawings might differentiate DLB from AD, pentagon drawings of autopsy-verified DLB (n = 16) and AD (n = 15) patients were assessed using the QSPT. The qualitative scoring encompasses the assessment of different parameters of the drawing, such as number of angles, distance/intersection, closure/opening, rotation, and closing-in. The QSPT scores were compared between groups using linear analyses and artificial neural network analyses at four different time points. Linear analyses showed that during the first evaluation, number of angles was the only parameter that showed a significant difference between DLB and AD patients. A gradual decline in other parameters and total pentagon score occurred in both groups during subsequent years, with greater decline for the DLB group. The artificial neural network analyses using auto-contractive maps showed that, with disease progression, DLB became related to relatively lower qualitative pentagon scores, whereas AD became related to relatively higher qualitative scores. These findings suggest that the QSPT might be a sensitive measure of visuo-constructive abilities able to differentiate DLB from AD at disease onset and as the diseases progress, but further studies on larger population are necessary in order to establish its clinical relevance. 
24305499	Increased levels of plasma p3-AlcÎ±35, a major fragment of AlcadeinÎ± by Î³-secretase cleavage, in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
p3-AlcÎ± is a metabolic fragment of AlcadeinÎ± (AlcÎ±). Similar to the generation of the p3 fragment from amyloid-Î² protein precursor (AÎ²PP) processing, AlcÎ± is cleaved by Î±- and Î³-secretases, leading to the secretion of p3-AlcÎ± peptides into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). p3-AlcÎ± is also detected in the plasma, similar to amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), which is a metabolic fragment of AÎ²PP cleaved by amyloidogenic Î²- and Î³-secretases. Because p3-AlcÎ± is a non-aggregatable and stable peptide, unlike aggregatable AÎ² and metabolically labile p3 of AÎ²PP, the changes of p3-AlcÎ± in quality and/or quantity in CSF and plasma are expected to be a marker for assessing alteration of substrate cleavage by Î³-secretase, such as AÎ² generation from AÎ²PP. The present study describes a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for quantifying levels of p3-AlcÎ±35, the major form of the p3-AlcÎ± species, and examines levels of p3-AlcÎ±35 in the plasma of three independent Japanese cohorts. In two of the three cohorts, the p3-AlcÎ±35 levels were significantly increased with a concomitant decrease in the Mini-Mental State Examination score, or in clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, when compared with age-matched non-demented subjects. The values were significantly lower in AD subjects who were administered donepezil, when compared to AD subjects without donepezil treatment. The increase in plasma p3-AlcÎ±35 levels may indicate an endophenotype in subjects in whom AD is due to a progressing cognitive impairment in subjects with a Î³-secretase malfunction, or a disorder of the clearance of peptides. 
24305500	AÎ²38 in the brains of patients with sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease and transgenic mouse models.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be closely dependent on deposits of neurotoxic amyloid-Î² peptides (AÎ²), which become abundantly present throughout the central nervous system in advanced stages of the disease. The different AÎ² peptides existing are generated by subsequent cleavage of the amyloid-Î² protein precursor (AÎ²PP) and may vary in length and differ at their C-terminus. Despite extensive studies on the most prevalent species AÎ²40 and AÎ²42, AÎ² peptides with other C-termini such as AÎ²38 have not received much attention. In the present study, we used a highly specific and sensitive antibody against AÎ²38 to analyze the distribution of this AÎ² species in cases of sporadic and familial AD, as well as in the brains of a series of established transgenic AD mouse models. We found AÎ²38 to be present as vascular deposits in the brains of the majority of sporadic AD cases, whereas it is largely absent in non-demented control cases. AÎ²38-positive extracellular plaques were virtually limited to familial cases. Interestingly we observed AÎ²38-positive plaques not only among familial cases due to AÎ²PP mutations, but also in cases of familial AD caused by presenilin (PSEN) mutations. Furthermore we demonstrate that AÎ²38 deposits in the form of extracellular plaques are common in several AD transgenic mouse models carrying either only AÎ²PP, or combinations of AÎ²PP, PSEN1, and tau transgenes. 
24533166	Aggregate-depleted brain fails to induce AÎ² deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140212 2014
Recent studies in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) show that amyloid-beta (AÎ²) misfolding can be transmissible; however, the mechanisms by which this process occurs have not been fully explored. The goal of this study was to analyze whether depletion of aggregates from an AD brain suppresses its in vivo "seeding" capability. Removal of aggregates was performed by using the Aggregate Specific Reagent 1 (ASR1) compound which has been previously described to specifically bind misfolded species. Our results show that pre-treatment with ASR1-coupled magnetic beads reduces the in vivo misfolding inducing capability of an AD brain extract. These findings shed light respect to the active principle responsible for the prion-like spreading of Alzheimer's amyloid pathology and open the possibility of using seeds-capturing reagents as a promising target for AD treatment.  
24040810	Pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease: role of oxidative stress, amyloid-Î² peptides, systemic ammonia and erythrocyte energy metabolism.
CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets  2014Feb
AÎ² exerts prooxidant or antioxidant effects based on the metal ion concentrations that it sequesters from the cytosol; at low metal ion concentrations, it is an antioxidant, whereas at relatively higher concentration it is a prooxidant. Thus Alzheimer disease (AD) treatment strategies based solely on the amyloid-Î² clearance should be re-examined in light of the vast accumulating evidence that increased oxidative stress in the human brains is the key causative factor for AD. Accumulating evidence indicates that the reduced brain glucose availability and brain hypoxia, due to the relatively lower concentration of ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, may be associated with increased concentration of endogenous ammonia, a potential neurotoxin in the AD brains. In this review, we summarize the progress in this area, and present some of our ongoing research activities with regard to brain Amyloid-Î², systemic ammonia, erythrocyte energy metabolism and the role of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in AD pathogenesis.  
24166182	TMEM106B and APOE polymorphisms interact to confer risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.
J Neural Transm 20131029 2014Mar
Recent large genome-wide association studies have found variants in TMEM106B (top SNP rs1990622) as a strong risk factor for frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Moreover, the TMEM106B risk variant is also implicated in the pathologic presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we evaluated the association between TMEM106B rs1990622 polymorphism and late-onset AD (LOAD) in a Northern Han Chinese population consists of 1,133 LOAD patients and 1,159 controls. Our data demonstrate that TMEM106B and APOE interact to increase AD risk.  
24321755	Oxidative balance, homocysteine, and uric acid levels in older patients with Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease or Vascular Dementia.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20131204 2014Feb15
This study aimed to investigate whether Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) and Vascular Dementia (VAD) might be associated with a distinct profile of oxidative stress (OxS) peripheral markers. Serum levels of hydroperoxides, homocysteine, advanced oxidation protein products, uric acid, thiols, and total and residual antioxidant power were assessed in 103 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 89 LOAD, 54 VAD patients and 48 Controls. Compared with Controls, a similar oxidative unbalance (high hydroperoxides and low residual antioxidant power) was observed in MCI, LOAD and, although less pronounced, VAD. Moreover, individuals with simultaneously high levels of homocysteine and uric acid, both well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, had a high probability to be affected by VAD (O.R.:10.50; 95% C.I.: 2.33-47.2), but not LOAD (O.R.: 3.0; 95% C.I.:0.86-10.76) compared with individuals with normal values. Our data suggest that, although they might share a common OxS-related pathogenesis, VAD and LOAD might maintain some distinctive features, with a predominance of "vascular component" in VAD compared with LOAD.  
24378065	Cerebral white matter disease is independently associated with BPSD in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20131204 2014Feb15
To study the association between cerebral white matter disease and burden of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) among patients with moderate to severe AD. Patients with moderate to severe AD having undergone MRI brain, cognitive and behavioral evaluations were studied. BPSD was diagnosed based on established clinical guidelines. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) were quantified by a blinded rater. 122 AD patients were studied. Age [76.84 vs. 72.70, p = 0.014] and MMSE [11.69 vs. 15.16, p &lt; 0.001] was significantly higher in patients with BPSD. BPSD patients demonstrated higher periventricular [5.44 vs. 4.21, p &lt; 0.001], deep subcortical [5.07 vs. 3.43, p &lt; 0.001], and total WMH [10.51 vs. 7.65, p &lt; 0.001] compared to non-BPSD patients. Higher proportion of BPSD patients had WMH in the highest tertile of severity (82.22% vs. 45.45%, p &lt; 0.001). After correcting for age, baseline cognition and degree of MTA, total WMH remained significantly associated with a diagnosis of BPSD [odds ratio: 1.45 (1.14-1.85; p = 0.002)]. With severe WMH, the association is significantly increased [odds ratio: 4.3 (1.3-12.5); p = 0.016]. WMH is independently associated with BPSD in moderate to severe AD. Optimizing vascular risk factors may be a strategy to reduce the severity of BPSD in AD. 
24440006	A possible cause of Alzheimer's dementia - industrial soy foods.
Med. Hypotheses 20131207 2014Mar
Alzheimer's data indicate that at present, approximately one new case of this form of dementia is identified in the USA every 68 s and that by 2050 the incidence will be about every 33 s, with projections from the Alzheimer Association (USA) indicating that nearly 25% of Americans will be affected by Alzheimer's dementia by 2031. Despite the numerous advances in medical science and neurological research, the causes are still unknown and the incidence is not decreasing or levelling out. Most research on the causes of Alzheimer's dementia indicates the possible roles of viruses, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, psychological depression, high blood pressure, frequent inflammation, environmental or domestic chemicals and toxins, or inescapable genetic factors. Alzheimer's, being the degeneration of parts of the neural pathways in the brain, may indeed involve neuro-toxic compounds that can bypass the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it is necessary to examine what is prolific in the environment and, in particular, the food supply. One of the many suggestions in the literature is the ingestion of food items derived from unfermented soybean products; the anti-thyroid, anti-nutrient, and endocrine disruption properties of soy can have a deleterious effect in many individuals. Among the many theories and different factors that may be involved in dementiae, soy consumption may be a significant contributor to Alzheimer's dementia, and it cannot be excluded as a possible contributing cause. Our hypothesis argues that consumption of soy food products may contribute to the increasing incidence of Alzheimer's dementia and other dementiae. 
23436150	Cell signaling abnormalities may drive neurodegeneration in familial Alzheimer disease.
Neurochem. Res. 20130223 2014Mar
Presenilins (PSs) are catalytic components of the Î³-secretase complex that produces AÎ² peptides. Substrates of Î³-secretase are membrane-bound protein fragments deriving from the cleavage of extracellular sequence of cell surface proteins. APP-derived Î³-secretase substrates are cleaved at gamma (Î³) sites to produce AÎ² while cleavage at the epsilon (Îµ) site produces AICD proposed to function in transcription. In addition to APP, Î³-secretase promotes the Îµ-cleavage of a large number of cell surface proteins producing cytosolic peptides shown to function in cell signaling. A common hypothesis suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by AÎ² peptides or their products. Treatment of patients with inhibitors of AÎ² production however, showed no therapeutic benefits while inducing cytotoxicity. Similarly, treatments with anti-AÎ² antibodies yielded disappointing results. Importantly, recent evidence shows that PS familial AD (FAD) mutations cause a loss of Î³-secretase cleavage activity at Îµ site of substrates thus inhibiting production of biologically important cell signaling peptides while promoting accumulation of membrane-bound cytotoxic substrates. These data support a hypothesis that FAD mutations may increase neurotoxicity by inhibiting the Î³-secretase-catalyzed Îµ cleavage of substrates thus interfering with cell signaling while also promoting accumulation of cytotoxic peptides. Similar mechanisms may explain Î³-secretase inhibitor-associated toxicities observed in clinical trials. Here we discuss evidence that FAD neurodegeneration may be caused by loss of Î³-secretase cleavage function at Îµ sites of substrates.  
24316473	Treatment effects in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: a magnetic resonance spectroscopy study after passive immunization.
Neuroscience 20131204 2014Feb14
Despite the enormous public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), no disease-modifying treatment has yet been proven to be efficacious in humans. A rate-limiting step in the discovery of potential therapies for humans is the absence of efficient non-invasive methods of evaluating drugs in animal models of disease. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a non-invasive way to evaluate the animals at baseline, at the end of treatment, and serially to better understand treatment effects. In this study, MRS was assessed as potential outcome measure for detecting disease modification in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Passive immunization with two different antibodies, which have been previously shown to reduce plaque accumulation in transgenic AD mice, was used as intervention. Treatment effects were detected by MRS, and the most striking finding was attenuation of myo-inositol (mIns) increases in APP-PS1 mice with both treatments. Additionally, a dose-dependent effect was observed with one of the treatments for mIns. MRS appears to be a valid in vivo measure of anti-AÎ² therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical studies. Because it is noninvasive, and can detect treatment effects, use of MRS-based endpoints could substantially accelerate drug discovery.  
23751371	Cortical and subcortical atrophy in Alzheimer disease: parallel atrophy of thalamus and hippocampus.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jan-Mar
Brain atrophy is a key imaging hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we carried out an integrative evaluation of AD-related atrophy. Twelve patients with AD and 13 healthy controls were enrolled. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of total brain tissue volumes with SIENAX. Localized gray matter atrophy was identified with optimized voxel-wise morphometry (FSL-VBM), and subcortical atrophy was evaluated by active shape model implemented in FMRIB's Integrated Registration Segmentation Toolkit. SIENAX analysis demonstrated total brain atrophy in AD patients; voxel-based morphometry analysis showed atrophy in the bilateral mediotemporal regions and in the posterior brain regions. In addition, regarding the diminished volumes of thalami and hippocampi in AD patients, subsequent vertex analysis of the segmented structures indicated shrinkage of the bilateral anterior thalami and the left medial hippocampus. Interestingly, the volume of the thalami and hippocampi were highly correlated with the volume of the thalami and amygdalae on both sides in AD patients, but not in healthy controls. This complex structural information proved useful in the detailed interpretation of AD-related neurodegenerative process, as the multilevel approach showed both global and local atrophy on cortical and subcortical levels. Most importantly, our results raise the possibility that subcortical structure atrophy is not independent in AD patients.  
23842286	Cerebral subcortical small vessel disease in subjects with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease: a clinicopathologic study in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA).
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jan-Mar
The understanding of how cerebrovascular disease (CVD) contributes to dementia is hampered by a lack of agreed and validated pathologic methods to accord weight to the contribution of different aspects of CVD to dementia. A previous study from the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) validated a scheme for assessing the contribution of subcortical small vessel disease (SVD) toward dementia in the elderly by showing a significant inverse relationship between the severity of SVD and cognition in subjects without any other dementia pathology using this method. In the present paper, the method has been used to assess severity of SVD in 161 cases of neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease. The results showed there was no relationship between the SVD score and cognitive scores acquired in the last 2 years of life. SVD scores were significantly related to age (P&lt;0.0017) and were slightly but significantly higher in females than males (P&lt;0.049). SVD scores were not related to blood pressure at entry to OPTIMA and were significantly lower when compared with the cohort of OPTIMA cases with only CVD (mean 5.06 Â± 1.85 vs. 5.9 Â± 2.67; P&lt;0.0065). We conclude that when Alzheimer disease pathology is present in elderly subjects, it overwhelms the modest contribution that SVD makes to cognitive impairment. 
24113562	Social workers' and nurses' illness representations about Alzheimer disease: an exploratory study.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jan-Mar
Professionals' perceptions of patients' diseases (illness representations) are a major factor influencing the quality of treatment they provide. The aim of the study was to examine and compare Alzheimer disease (AD) illness representations among 2 main professional groups involved in the care of Alzheimer patients. A total of 327 nurses and social workers in Israel were asked to report their cognitive representations (dimensions of identity, cause, timeline, consequences, control, coherence, timeline cycle) and emotional representations. Knowledge about AD, demographic, and occupational characteristics were also obtained. Participants perceived AD as a chronic disease associated with severe consequences. Statistically significant differences were found between the groups, as nurses attributed psychological reasons to AD more than the social workers. Nevertheless, social workers perceived AD as more chronic with severe consequences compared with the nurses. Despite some resemblance, there were differences between the social workers and nurses regarding AD illness representations. Therefore, continuing to distribute materials to professionals regarding AD is recommended, with attention to the unique characteristics of each professional group. Furthermore, the findings encourage the development of training and support programs that will not only deal with the organizational and instrumental levels of treating AD patients but also with the assessment and consequences of professionals' illness representations.  
24126214	Body mass index, weight change, and clinical progression in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord  2014 Jan-Mar
The speed and severity of clinical progression after Alzheimer disease (AD) diagnosis varies and depends on multiple factors, most not well elucidated. We assessed whether body mass index (BMI) and 1-year weight change (WC) are associated with clinical progression in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and early-stage AD. Longitudinal data comprising 2268 aMCI and 1506 AD participants in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set were used to examine nuances of clinical progression by BMI and WC, as well as potential variations in associations by age, sex, BMI (WC model), or apolipoprotein E genotype. In aMCI, high BMI (vs. moderate BMI) was associated with slower progression; weight loss (vs. no WC) was associated with faster progression. In AD, no significant differences were observed in clinical progression by BMI or WC. The association between BMI and clinical progression varied significantly by apolipoprotein E genotype in AD, and the association between WC and clinical progression varied significantly by sex and BMI in aMCI. Baseline BMI and 1-year WC in late life may serve as early prognostic indicators in aMCI and early-stage AD. If replicated, these results may help in counseling patients on anticipated clinical progression and suggest windows of opportunity for intervention.  
24296900	Familial coaggregation of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis.
Neuroepidemiology 20131130 2014
Familial aggregation has been shown for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) separately, and it has been hypothesized that these diseases also coaggregate in families. The authors investigated familial coaggregation of AD and PD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed was searched for relevant studies published through the end of October 2012. Three independent investigators screened publications and extracted data. Relative risk estimates of AD risk associated with family history of PD or parkinsonism, or PD risk associated with family history of AD or dementia, were summarized into metaestimates using random effects models. Heterogeneity and publication bias were tested using Higgins' and Egger's tests, respectively. We included 16 studies in the review, with 14 included in any meta-analysis. AD risk associated with family history of PD yielded a summary hazard ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.00-1.39) based on 5 reconstructed cohort studies and a summary odds ratio (OR) of 1.40 (95% CI: 0.92-2.12) based on 7 case-control studies. PD risk associated with family history of AD yielded a summary OR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.49-1.16) based on 3 studies. There was no significant heterogeneity among studies, nor significant publication bias. There may be familial coaggregation of AD and PD, although the association was modest and only apparent when studying AD risk associated with family history of PD. 
24490853	Amyloid-based immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease in the time of prevention trials: the way forward.
Expert Rev Clin Immunol 20140204 2014Mar
Both active and passive anti-Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) immunotherapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have demonstrated clearance of brain AÎ² deposits. Among passive immunotherapeutics, two Phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate AD patients with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at the N-terminal sequence of AÎ², were disappointing. Also solanezumab, directed at the mid-region of AÎ², failed in two Phase III trials in mild-to-moderate AD. Another Phase III trial with solanezumab is ongoing in mildly affected AD patients based on encouraging results in this subgroup. Second-generation active AÎ² vaccines (CAD106, ACC-001, and Affitope AD02) and new passive anti-AÎ² immunotherapies (gantenerumab and crenezumab) have been developed and are under clinical testing. These new anti-AÎ² immunotherapies are being tested in prodromal AD, in presymptomatic subjects with AD-related mutations, or in asymptomatic subjects at risk of developing AD. These primary and secondary prevention trials will definitely test the AÎ² cascade hypothesis of AD. 
24550710	Significance of normalization on anatomical MRI measures in predicting Alzheimer's disease.
ScientificWorldJournal 20140106 2014
This study establishes a new approach for combining neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures for an optimal decisional space to classify subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This approach relies on a multivariate feature selection method with different MRI normalization techniques. Subcortical volume, cortical thickness, and surface area measures are obtained using MRIs from 189 participants (129 normal controls and 60 AD patients). Statistically significant variables were selected for each combination model to construct a multidimensional space for classification. Different normalization approaches were explored to gauge the effect on classification performance using a support vector machine classifier. Results indicate that the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) measure is most discriminative among single-measure models, while subcortical volume combined with MMSE is the most effective multivariate model for AD classification. The study demonstrates that subcortical volumes need not be normalized, whereas cortical thickness should be normalized either by intracranial volume or mean thickness, and surface area is a weak indicator of AD with and without normalization. On the significant brain regions, a nearly perfect symmetry is observed for subcortical volumes and cortical thickness, and a significant reduction in thickness is particularly seen in the temporal lobe, which is associated with brain deficits characterizing AD.  
24368848	Neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons are functionally integrated in cortical circuits in vivo.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 20131224 2014Jan7
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid-Î² plaques and intracellular aggregation of tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (1, 2). Progression of NFT pathology is closely correlated with both increased neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD (3) and other tauopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia (4, 5). The assumption that mislocalization of tau into the somatodendritic compartment (6) and accumulation of fibrillar aggregates in NFTs mediates neurodegeneration underlies most current therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing NFT formation or disrupting existing NFTs (7, 8). Although several disease-associated mutations cause both aggregation of tau and neurodegeneration, whether NFTs per se contribute to neuronal and network dysfunction in vivo is unknown (9). Here we used awake in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor neuronal function in adult rTg4510 mice that overexpress a human mutant form of tau (P301L) and develop cortical NFTs by the age of 7-8 mo (10). Unexpectedly, NFT-bearing neurons in the visual cortex appeared to be completely functionally intact, to be capable of integrating dendritic inputs and effectively encoding orientation and direction selectivity, and to have a stable baseline resting calcium level. These results suggest a reevaluation of the common assumption that insoluble tau aggregates are sufficient to disrupt neuronal function.  
24165480	Unfolded protein response signaling by transcription factor XBP-1 regulates ADAM10 and is affected in Alzheimer's disease.
FASEB J. 20131028 2014Feb
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), disturbed homeostasis of the proteases competing for amyloid precursor protein processing has been reported: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), the physiological Î±-secretase, is decreased in favor of the amyloid-Î²-generating enzyme BACE-1. To identify transcription factors that modulate the expression of either protease, we performed a screening approach: 48 transcription factors significantly interfered with ADAM10/BACE-1-promoter activity. One selective inducer of ADAM10 gene expression is the X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1). This protein regulates the unfolded protein-response pathway. We demonstrate that particularly the spliced XBP-1 variant dose dependently regulates ADAM10 expression, which can be synergistically enhanced by 100 nM insulin. Analysis of 2 different transgenic mouse models (APP/PS1 and 5xFAD) revealed that at early time points in pathology XBP-1 metabolism is induced. This is accompanied by a 2-fold augmented ADAM10 amount as compared with nontransgenic littermates (P=0.011). Along with aging of the mice, the system is counterregulated, and XBP-1 together with ADAM10 expression level decreased to âˆ¼50% as compared with control animals. Analyses of expression levels in human AD brains showed that ADAM10 mRNA correlated with active XBP-1 (r=0.3120), but expression did not reach levels of healthy age-matched controls, suggesting deregulation of XBP-1 signaling. Our results demonstrate that XBP-1 is a driver of ADAM10 gene expression and that disturbance of this pathway might contribute to development or progression of AD. 
24249638	Amyloid precursor protein Î±- and Î²-cleaved ectodomains exert opposing control of cholesterol homeostasis via SREBP2.
FASEB J. 20131118 2014Feb
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is ubiquitously expressed. Studies in neuronal cells have implicated APP or its fragments as negative regulators of cholesterol metabolism. In the current study, APP acted, via its Î±-cleavage, as a positive regulator of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2) signaling in human astrocytic cells (U251MG), hepatic cells (HepG2), and primary fibroblasts, leading to an approximate 30% increase in SRE-dependent gene expression and, consequently, enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL receptor levels. This effect was mediated via the secretory ectodomain APPsÎ±. The Î²-cleaved ectodomain, in turn, repressed SRE-dependent gene expression by up to âˆ¼ 30%. This resulted in decreased cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor content, establishing a physiological feedback loop in cholesterol-loaded cells, where APP undergoes preferential Î²-cleavage. Patients with familial Alzheimer's disease had decreased circulating lathosterol, reflecting hepatic cholesterol synthesis, and their fibroblasts had reduced LDL receptor content, which was alleviated by decreasing Î²-cleavage. These results show that APP regulates cholesterol metabolism in cells relevant for whole-body cholesterol balance and reveal that APP Î±- and Î²-cleavages produce opposing paracrine regulators of SREBP2 signaling. 
24107324	Memantine in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease: meta-analyses using realistic definitions of response.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131003 2014
We aimed to develop realistic definitions of clinical worsening in advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to use them in a post hoc responder analysis of memantine. 2,340 patients with moderate to severe AD (Mini-Mental State Examination &lt;20) were included from 9 multicentre, 16- to 28-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of memantine 20 mg/day versus placebo. Responder meta-analyses were performed, with definitions of response based on minimally important differences (MIDs) on cognitive, functional, and global assessment scales. Validated or established MIDs were used where available; otherwise, MIDs were estimated by a data-driven approach, using data from our moderate to severe AD population. Patients with moderate to severe AD treated with memantine had a lower incidence of worsening from baseline to endpoint than patients treated with placebo, in cognition [24.4 vs. 35.0%; odds ratio (OR) = 0.60; p &lt; 0.001], function (38.1 vs. 43.4%; OR = 0.81; p = 0.01), global status (39.8 vs. 48.6%; OR = 0.70; p &lt; 0.001), and in a combined 'triple' worsening measure (9.4 vs. 16.1%; OR = 0.54; p &lt; 0.001). New definitions of clinical worsening based on MIDs represent a more realistic functional decline in advanced stages of AD. Results of this new analysis show that memantine reduces the incidence of clinical worsening in key symptomatic domains in moderate to severe AD. 
24107364	Confrontation naming errors in Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131003 2014
Impairment in visual interpretation, semantic conception, or word retrieval may contribute to the naming errors identified in the Boston Naming Test (BNT). We investigated the possible cognitive mechanism of the naming difficulty in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by analyzing the error patterns presented in the BNT. The Chinese version of the 30-item BNT (BNT-30) was performed on 115 normal control (NC) subjects and 104 mild-to-moderate AD patients. Accurate rates after semantic and phonemic cues were analyzed. The frequencies of 7 types of error patterns in the AD patients and the NC subjects were compared. The accurate rate after semantic cues was significantly lower in the AD than in the NC groups, but phonemic cues were more helpful than semantic cues to achieve accurate naming in both groups. The AD patients made more errors in all error patterns. Particularly, the frequency of nonresponse errors (n = 806) in the AD group significantly exceeded that in the NC group (n = 382). However, the distribution of the error patterns did not differ between the two groups. Naming difficulties in AD might be attributed to progressive semantic knowledge degradation. The AD and the NC groups differ quantitatively but not qualitatively in the error patterns in confrontation naming. 
24107412	Evidence of the sensitivity of the MoCA alternate forms in monitoring cognitive change in early Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131008 2014
There is an increasing interest in using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test as a monitoring tool in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both research and clinical settings. Our aim was to investigate the utility of alternate forms of the MoCA in detecting cognitive deterioration in a sample of early AD patients followed longitudinally in an outpatient memory clinic. Twenty-five patients with early-stage AD (prodromal or mild dementia) were administered the original version and one of two previously validated alternate forms of the MoCA within an interval of about 1 year. The decline over time and the rate of change of the MoCA were compared to the total score of a standardized neuropsychological assessment battery (Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease; CERAD-Plus). Responsiveness to change was determined by calculating standard response means and the respective effect sizes. Sixty percent of the sample showed a clinical decline on the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale. There was significant deterioration in the MoCA and CERAD total scores. The results demonstrate that the MoCA is capable of detecting change over time and seems to be a valid tool with small to moderate sensitivity for monitoring cognitive change in early AD. 
24107621	Neuroinflammation and Î² amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease: in vivo quantification with molecular imaging.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131001 2014
Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its relationship with underlying Î² amyloid deposition remains unclear. In vivo visualization of microglial activation has become possible with the development of molecular imaging ligands when used with positron emission tomography (PET). The translocator protein (TSPO) is upregulated during neuroinflammation. Consequently, targeting TSPO with radiolabeled ligands for PET is an attractive biomarker for neuroinflammation. A review of the research literature on PET imaging which studied in vivo neuroinflammation in AD subjects and its relationship with amyloid load was performed, including papers published between 2001 and 2012. Six studies were included using either [(11)C]PK-11195 or another non-TSPO radioligand that binds to the monoaminooxidase B. All the studies evaluated amyloid load with [(11)C]PIB. Microglial activation and astrocytosis are potentially early phenomena in AD. However, the individual levels of amyloid deposition and microglial activation were not correlated. Noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging to visualize neuroinflammation in AD may contribute to our understanding of the kinetics of neuroinflammation and its relationship to the hallmarks of the disease. Both are important for the development of future therapeutic modalities and for quantifying the efficacy of future disease-modifying treatments. 
24107650	Serial position effects in patients with mild cognitive impairment and early and moderate Alzheimer's disease compared with healthy comparison subjects.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131003 2014
This study aimed to investigate whether the serial position effects in memory can differentiate patients with different subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls and patients with different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The serial position effects was tested with the CERAD word list task in 184 persons (39 healthy control subjects, 15 amnestic MCI single domain subjects, 23 amnestic MCI multiple domain subjects, 31 nonamnestic MCI subjects, 45 early or mild AD patients, and 31 moderate AD patients). With progression of dementia, memory deficits increased and the impairment in the primacy effect during the learning trials advanced, whereas the recall of recent items was less impaired. The serial position profile of nonamnestic MCI patients resembled that of healthy control subjects, whereas amnestic MCI patients showed poorer performance in all 3 positions but no significant difference as a function of serial word position. Analyses of the serial position effect may be a useful complement to clinical neuropsychological measures for distinguishing amnestic MCI patients from normal aging and patients with different stages of dementia. 
24107805	Impact of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genetic polymorphism on combined cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine treatment in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 20131003 2014
The impact of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 polymorphism on the steady-state plasma concentrations and therapeutic outcome of donepezil monotherapy and combination therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A total of 38 patients for donepezil and 17 patients for donepezil and memantine therapy, aged â‰¥ 55 years, were recruited meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was performed. The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used for estimation of drug levels of donepezil and memantine. Significant allele frequency was observed for CYP2D6*3 polymorphism in patients on donepezil monotherapy and combination therapy. Significant allele frequency for CYP2D6*4 was observed in the patients on donepezil monotherapy. CYP2D6 polymorphism, though not significant, might partially be involved in the plasma concentration of AD drug. 
24515678	Differences in anxiety among patients with early- versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci  2014Winter
The authors sought to evaluate the incidence and correlates of anxiety in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) versus the more typical late-onset AD (LOAD). A group of 23 EOAD and 22 LOAD patients were compared by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Anxiety subscale. Demographic and disease-related relationships with anxiety were evaluated, as well as types of anxiety symptoms that were endorsed. EOAD patients had significantly more anxiety symptoms than LOAD patients. Among those with EOAD, anxiety was associated with male gender, higher Mini-Mental State Exam score, and separation from caregivers. Among LOAD patients, anxiety was associated with psychotic and activating psychiatric symptoms. These results have implications for the management and alleviation of anxiety in AD.  
24047568	Ultra-structural analysis of the brain in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease using FIB/SEM microscopy.
Microscopy (Oxf) 20130918 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative brain diseases, has been extensively researched for years. However, its synaptic structure, which is a basis for understanding neurodegenerative disorders, has not yet been understood clearly. Defining the structures of neurons and their synaptic connections is the significant goal of brain research. To study synaptic connectivity, three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the nervous system are very helpful. In this study, the 3D structure of brain synapses in the Drosophila melanogaster Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutant, which is characterized by early onset AD, was analyzed using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). This technique is one of the most useful for 3D reconstruction, as the process of obtaining serial images is fully automated and thus avoids the problems inherent in hand-operated ultrathin serial sectioning. The 3D images of normal and AD brains reported in this study reveal characteristic features of AD such as appearance of autophagy, abnormal axon formation and increased mitochondrial size. This 3D analysis reveals structural change as a basis for understanding neurodegenerative disorder.  
23907243	Visual-statistical interpretation of (18)F-FDG-PET images for characteristic Alzheimer patterns in a multicenter study: inter-rater concordance and relationship to automated quantitative evaluation.
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 20130801 2014Feb
The role of (18)F-FDG-PET in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is increasing and should be validated. The aim of this study was to assess the inter-rater variability in the interpretation of (18)F-FDG-PET images obtained in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a multicenter clinical research project. This study analyzed 274 (18)F-FDG-PET scans (67 mild Alzheimer disease, 100 mild cognitive impairment, and 107 normal cognitive) as baseline scans for the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which were acquired with various types of PET or PET/CT scanners in 23 facilities. Three independent raters interpreted all PET images by using a combined visual-statistical method. The images were classified into 7 (FDG-7) patterns by the criteria of Silverman et al and further into 2 (FDG-2) patterns. Agreement among the 7 visual-statistical categories by at least 2 of the 3 readers occurred in &gt;94% of cases for all groups: Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal cognitive. Perfect matches by all 3 raters were observed for 62% of the cases by FDG-7 and 76 by FDG-2. Inter-rater concordance was moderate by FDG-7 (Îº = 0.57) and substantial in FDG-2 (Îº = 0.67) on average. The FDG-PET score, an automated quantitative index developed by Herholz et al, increased as the number of raters who voted for the AD pattern increased (Ï? = 0.59, P &lt; .0001), and the FDG-PET score decreased as those for normal pattern increased (Ï? = -0.64, P &lt; .0001). Inter-rater agreement was moderate to substantial for the combined visual-statistical interpretation of (18)F-FDG-PET and was also significantly associated with automated quantitative assessment. 
24387228	Microtubule-associated protein tau as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.
Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 20140103 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health problem in modern society and as yet, other than a few symptomatic drugs, there is no disease-modifying treatment for this disease available. Neurofibrillary pathology, which is made up from abnormally hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau, is both a hallmark and key lesion of AD and related tauopathies. The density of neurofibrillary pathology in the cerebral cortex correlates with the degree of dementia. Both experimental and transgenic animal studies have consistently shown that abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau causes cognitive impairment. Abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau converts it from a microtubule assembly-promoting to a microtubule-disrupting protein and promotes its self-assembly into paired helical filaments. To date, the bulk of studies have shown that abnormal hyperphosphorylation is the key gain of toxic function step though some cell culture and transgenic mouse studies have also reported that aggregated tau can lead to neurodegeneration. In this article, we have reviewed data from our lab and that from PubMed search on the molecular mechanism of tau pathology and the potential of tau as a therapeutic target for AD and related disorders. In our opinion, inhibition of abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau is the most rational therapeutic target. Therapeutic approaches include restoration of the activity of protein phosphatase-2A, which is the major regulator of tau phosphorylation and the activity of which is compromised in AD brain, inhibition of one or more tau protein kinases which include GSK-3Î², cyclin-dependent protein kinase-5, dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylated-regulated kinase 1A, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-activated protein kinase II and casein kinase I, enhancement of O-GlcNAcylation of tau, and tau immunization. 
24405291	Plant-based vaccines for Alzheimer's disease: an overview.
Expert Rev Vaccines 20140103 2014Mar
Plants are considered advantageous platforms for biomanufacturing recombinant vaccines. This constitutes a field of intensive research and some plant-derived vaccines are expected to be marketed in the near future. In particular, plant-based production of immunogens targeting molecules with implications on the pathology of Alzheimer's has been explored over the last decade. These efforts involve targeting amyloid beta and Î²-secretase with several immunogen configurations that have been evaluated in test animals. The results of these developments are analyzed in this review. Perspectives on the topic are identified, such as exploring additional antigen configurations and adjuvants in order to improve immunization schemes, characterizing in detail the elicited immune responses, and immunological considerations in the achievement of therapeutic humoral responses via mucosal immunization. Safety concerns related to these therapies will also be discussed.  
24523331	[Comparative analysis of structural changes in thrombocytes during Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases].
Georgian Med News  2014Jan
The paper deals with the study of the changes in the formed elements of blood during the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. While studying the structure of thrombocytes, a number of identical structural changes were identified in case of both diseases. The study has revealed various shapes of thrombocytes, the production of pseudopodia on their surface, high level of body outline, specific distribution of glycogen granules and their concentration on the periphery, glycogen eruption, dissociation of Alpha-granules towards the edge, and effective outline and density of the granules. There are frequent cases of the granule eruption from the body (exocytosis), the existence of vacuoles on the matrix, the rise in the number of gigantic thrombocytes and, consequently, considerable enhancement of the ability of absorption. Besides, there is a rise in the number of degenerated cells. The shape of thrombocytes is often changed and stretched on one side. The produced pseudopodia make the impression of participation in phagocytosis. As for the difference between changes, during Parkinson disease the amount of thrombocytes is low, more gigantic and distorted shape, less invagination of plasma membrane, low amount of granules and less intensity of alpha-granule eruption from the body. The changes revealed by the research show the activity of thrombocytes, which should be connected to their participation in protective functions of the body towards existing agent. And the diseases - although with similar but with different pathogenic mechanisms - are being developed with participation of non-specific agents.  
24523319	Sorting the role of SORLA in Alzheimer's disease.

Cell culture and mouse models unravel how the SORLA receptor negatively regulates Î²-amyloid (Caglayan et al.).  
24523320	Lysosomal sorting of amyloid-Î² by the SORLA receptor is impaired by a familial Alzheimer's disease mutation.
Sci Transl Med  2014Feb12
SORLA/SORL1 is a unique neuronal sorting receptor for the amyloid precursor protein that has been causally implicated in both sporadic and autosomal dominant familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain concentrations of SORLA are inversely correlated with amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) in mouse models and AD patients, suggesting that increasing expression of this receptor could be a therapeutic option for decreasing the amount of amyloidogenic products in affected individuals. We characterize a new mouse model in which SORLA is overexpressed, and show a decrease in AÎ² concentrations in mouse brain. We trace the underlying molecular mechanism to the ability of this receptor to direct lysosomal targeting of nascent AÎ² peptides. AÎ² binds to the amino-terminal VPS10P domain of SORLA, and this binding is impaired by a familial AD mutation in SORL1. Thus, loss of SORLA's AÎ² sorting function is a potential cause of AD in patients, and SORLA may be a new therapeutic target for AD drug development.  
24355211	Antisense oligonucleotide against GSK-3Î² in brain of SAMP8 mice improves learning and memory and decreases oxidative stress: Involvement of transcription factor Nrf2 and implications for Alzheimer disease.
Free Radic. Biol. Med. 20131216 2014Feb
Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3Î² is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in the pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the heightened levels of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-beta (AÎ²), and neurodegeneration. In this study we used 12-month-old SAMP8 mice, an AD model, to examine the effects GSK-3Î² may cause regarding the cognitive impairment and oxidative stress associated with AD. To suppress the level of GSK-3Î², SAMP8 mice were treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (GAO) directed at this kinase. We measured a decreased level of GSK-3Î² in the cortex of the mice, indicating the success of the antisense treatment. Learning and memory assessments of the SAMP8 mice were tested post-antisense treatment using an aversive T-maze and object recognition test, both of which observably improved. In cortex samples of the SAMP8 mice, decreased levels of protein carbonyl and protein-bound HNE were measured, indicating decreased oxidative stress. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor known to increase the level of many antioxidants, including glutathione-S transferase (GST), and is negatively regulated by the activity of GSK-3Î². Our results indicated the increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 and level of GST, suggesting the increased activity of the transcription factor as a result of GSK-3Î² suppression, consistent with the decreased oxidative stress observed. Consistent with the improved learning and memory, and consistent with GSK-3b being a tau kinase, we observed decreased tau phosphorylation in brain of GAO-treated SAMP8 mice compared to that of RAO-treated SAMP8 mice. Lastly, we examined the ability of GAO to cross the blood-brain barrier and determined it to be possible. The results presented in this study demonstrate that reducing GSK-3 with a phosphorothionated antisense against GSK-3 improves learning and memory, reduces oxidative stress, possibly coincident with increased levels of the antioxidant transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and decreases tau phosphorylation. Our study supports the notion of GAO as a possible treatment for AD.  
24491518	Brain stem hemorrhage due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy: the autopsy of a patient with Alzheimer's disease at a young age.
Leg Med (Tokyo) 20140117 2014Mar
We report findings from an autopsy of a male in his 40s who died of a brain stem hemorrhage associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are histopathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our immunohistochemical study demonstrated amyloid Î² (AÎ²) deposition in the small cerebral arteries and SPs. Although hypertension (178/132 mmHg) was detected, the subject was not treated accordingly. CAA coupled with hypertension might have caused the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). 
24438720	Health utility scores in Alzheimer's disease: differences based on calculation with American and Canadian preference weights.
Value Health  2014 Jan-Feb
Health utility scores quantify health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These scores are calculated by using preference weights derived from general population samples. We recruited persons with AD and their primary informal caregivers and examined differences in health utility scores calculated by using two sets of published preference weights. We recruited participants from nine clinics across Canada and administered the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire HRQOL instrument. We converted participants' EQ-5D questionnaire responses into two sets of health utility scores by using US and Canadian preference weights. We assessed agreement between sets by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Bland-Altman plots depicted individual-level differences between sets. For 216 persons with AD and their caregivers, mean health utility scores were higher when calculated with US instead of Canadian preference weights (P &lt; 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient (95% CI) was 0.79 (0.05-0.93) in the persons with AD group and 0.83 (0.30-0.94) in the caregiver group. Ninety-five percent of the individual differences in utility score fell between -0.16 and 0.03 for persons with AD and -0.15 and 0.05 for caregivers. Forty-three percent of these differences exceeded a minimum clinically important threshold of 0.074. In AD studies, researchers should calculate health utility scores by using preference weights obtained in the general population of their country of interest. Using weights from other countries' populations could bias the utilities and adversely affect the results of economic evaluations of AD treatments. 
24324263	Down-regulation of mortalin exacerbates AÎ²-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131209 2014Jan24
Mitochondrial dynamics greatly influence the biogenesis and morphology of mitochondria. Mitochondria are particularly important in neurons, which have a high demand for energy. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction is strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Until now various post-translational modifications for mitochondrial dynamic proteins and several regulatory proteins have explained complex mitochondrial dynamics. However, the precise mechanism that coordinates these complex processes remains unclear. To further understand the regulatory machinery of mitochondrial dynamics, we screened a mitochondrial siRNA library and identified mortalin as a potential regulatory protein. Both genetic and chemical inhibition of mortalin strongly induced mitochondrial fragmentation and synergistically increased AÎ²-mediated cytotoxicity as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly we determined that the expression of mortalin in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and in the triple transgenic-AD mouse model was considerably decreased. In contrast, overexpression of mortalin significantly suppressed AÎ²-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. Taken together, our results suggest that down-regulation of mortalin may potentiate AÎ²-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction in AD.  
24502805	How plausible is a link between HSV-1 infection and Alzheimer's disease?
Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther 20140206 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause of dementia with a multifactorial and still barely understood etiology. A growing body of epidemiologic and experimental data support a role for infectious agents in this process; herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), in particular, is a strong suspect. We briefly summarize the data pointing at a pathogenic role for HSV-1 in the development of Alzheimer's disease and review results indicating that antiviral might be beneficial in the therapy of this condition.  
24512022	Relationship between amyloid-beta and the ubiquitin-proteasome system in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurol. Res.  2014Mar
Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is the original causative factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the major intracellular protein quality control system in eukaryotic cells, is related to AD pathogenesis. There is growing evidence showing that there is a tight relationship between Abeta and UPS and this relationship plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. This article reviews the relationship between Abeta and the UPS in terms of the following three aspects: the interaction of the two factors, the ubiquitinating process of Abeta, and impact of dysfunctional UPS on Abeta production. The impairment in the UPS in AD could affect the degradation of Abeta and lead to an abnormal accumulation of Abeta. At the same time, Abeta inhibits the proteasomal activity and subsequently leads to impairment of multivesicular bodies (MVB) sorting pathway, forming an interacting relationship between Abeta and UPS. Mutant ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (UBL) ubiquilin-1 are related to Abeta accumulation. Meanwhile E2 conjugating enzymes, E3 ligases, and de-ubiquitinating enzymes, all of which function in the ubiquitination process, play a pivotal role in the proteasomal degradation of Abeta. Ubiquitin-proteasome system has an immense impact on the amyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing that generates Abeta. Upregulation in proteasomal degradation of BACE1 and components of gamma-secretase leads to decreased Abeta accumulation. A deep look into the mechanism underlying the interplay between Abeta and UPS may provide alternative therapeutic targets and lead to new drugs and therapies.  
24518227	Magnetic resonance imaging for monitoring therapeutic response in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease using voxel-based analysis of amyloid plaques.
Neuroreport  2014Mar5
In this study, we have shown the potential of a voxel-based analysis for imaging amyloid plaques and its utility in monitoring therapeutic response in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice using manganese oxide nanoparticles conjugated with an antibody of AÎ²1-40 peptide (HMON-abAÎ²40). T1-weighted MR brain images of a drug-treated AD group (n=7), a nontreated AD group (n=7), and a wild-type group (n=7) were acquired using a 7.0 T MRI system before (D-1), 24-h (D+1) after, and 72-h (D+3) after injection with an HMON-abAÎ²40 contrast agent. For the treatment of AD mice, DAPT was injected intramuscularly into AD transgenic mice (50 mg/kg of body weight). For voxel-based analysis, the skull-stripped mouse brain images were spatially normalized, and these voxels' intensities were corrected to reduce voxel intensity differences across scans in different mice. Statistical analysis showed higher normalized MR signal intensity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of AD mice over wild-type mice on D+1 and D+3 (P&lt;0.01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). After the treatment of AD mice, the normalized MR signal intensity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus decreased significantly in comparison with nontreated AD mice on D+1 and D+3 (P&lt;0.01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). These results were confirmed by histological analysis using a thioflavin staining. This unique strategy allows us to detect brain regions that are subjected to amyloid plaque deposition and has the potential for human applications in monitoring therapeutic response for drug development in AD.  
24550686	Icariin decreases the expression of APP and BACE-1 and reduces the Î²-amyloid burden in an APP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 20140121 2014
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and pharmacological mechanisms of icariin, which is the main component in the traditional Chinese herb Epimedium, on Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) production in an amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (Tg) mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). APPV717I Tg mice were randomly divided into a model group and icariin-treated (30 and 100 Î¼mol/kg per day) groups. Learning-memory abilities were determined by Morris water maze and object recognition tests. AÎ² contents were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunohistochemistry. Amyloid plaques were detected by Congo red staining and Bielschowsky silver staining. The levels of expression of APP and Î²-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) were measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Ten-month-old Tg mice showed obvious learning-memory impairments, and significant increases in AÎ² contents, amyloid plaques, and APP and BACE-1 levels in the hippocampus. The intragastric administration of icariin to Tg mice for 6 months (from 4 to 10 months of age) improved the learning-memory abilities and significantly decreased the AÎ² contents, amyloid plaques, and APP and BACE-1 levels in the hippocampus. Icariin reduced the AÎ² burden and amyloid plaque deposition in the hippocampus of APP transgenic mice by decreasing the APP and BACE-1 levels. These novel findings suggest that icariin may be a promising treatment in patients with AD. 
24666146	Predictors of Grief in Bereaved Family Caregivers of Person's With Alzheimer's Disease: A Prospective Study.
Death Stud 20131018 2014Jul
The purpose of this prospective study was to identify factors in 66 spouses and adult child caregivers of person's with Alzheimer's disease prior to the death that predicted higher levels of grief in bereavement. A hierarchical regression model was tested. Predeath grief, dysfunctional coping, depression, social support, and decreased positive states of mind explained 54.7% of the variance in postdeath grief. Factors that contributed significantly to postdeath grief included predeath grief and depression. Results from this study indicate that risk factors for postdeath grief can be predicted prior to the death.  
24220168	Reversal of metabolic deficits by lipoic acid in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: a 13C NMR study.
J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 20131113 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by deterioration of cognition and loss of memory. Several clinical studies have shown Alzheimer's disease to be associated with disturbances in glucose metabolism and the subsequent tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related metabolites like glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA). These metabolites have been viewed as biomarkers by (a) assisting early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and (b) evaluating the efficacy of a treatment regimen. In this study, 13-month-old triple transgenic mice (a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD)) were given intravenous infusion of [1-(13)C]glucose followed by an ex vivo (13)C NMR to determine the concentrations of (13)C-labeled isotopomers of Glu, Gln, aspartate (Asp), GABA, myo-inositol, and NAA. Total ((12)C+(13)C) Glu, Gln, and Asp were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography to calculate enrichment. Furthermore, we examined the effects of lipoic acid in modulating these metabolites, based on its previously established insulin mimetic effects. Total (13)C labeling and percent enrichment decreased by âˆ¼50% in the 3xTg-AD mice. This hypometabolism was partially or completely restored by lipoic acid feeding. The ability of lipoic acid to restore glucose metabolism and subsequent TCA cycle-related metabolites further substantiates its role in overcoming the hypometabolic state inherent in early stages of Alzheimer's disease.  
24443391	Investigation of association of serotonin transporter and monoamine oxidase-A genes with Alzheimer's disease and depression in the VITA study cohort: a 90-month longitudinal study.
Am. J. Med. Genet. B Neuropsychiatr. Genet. 20140117 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression (DE) are common psychiatric disorders strongly intertwined with one another. Nevertheless, etiology and early diagnosis of the disorders are still elusive. Several genetic variations have been suggested to associate with AD and DE, particularly in genes involved in the serotonergic system such as the serotonin transporter (SERT/SLC6A4), responsible for the removal from the synaptic cleft, and the monoamine-oxidase-A (MAOA), responsible for the presynaptic degradation of serotonin. Here, we attempt to characterize this pleiotropic effect for the triallelic SERT gene-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR) and for the MAOA-uVNTR, in participants in the Vienna-Transdanube-Aging (VITA)-study. The VITA-study is a community-based longitudinal study following a birth cohort (75 years old at baseline examination, n = 606) from Vienna for a period of 90 months with a regular follow-up interval of 30 months. Our main finding, confirming previous reports, is that the 5HTTLPR S-allele is a risk allele for DE (OR = 1.55 CI 95% 1.03-2.32) and its carriers had a steeper increase in SGDS sum score. No association to AD was found. MAOA-uVNTR did not associate with either AD or DE. However, in AD MAOA-uVNTR S-allele carriers a steeper increase of HAMD and STAI1 sum scores (P &lt; 0.05) was observed. Although the VITA-study cohort is rather small with low power to detect gene alterations, the uniqueness of this very thoroughly investigated and homogenous cohort strengthens the results through exceptional data collection. Still, reinvestigation in a larger cohort similar to this, as well as a meta-analysis, is important to confirm these results. 
24464990	A variant within FGF1 is associated with Alzheimer's disease in the Han Chinese population.
Am. J. Med. Genet. B Neuropsychiatr. Genet. 20140124 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (AÎ²) plaques and Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles in vulnerable brain areas. The progression of AD is well correlated with hippocampal neuron loss which highly suggests genes associated with neuron survival would be important for AD pathogenesis. According to the recent results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other reported studies, we selected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs3765728 within tumor protein p73 (P73), and rs34011 within fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), both genes were related to neuron survival. We analyzed the distribution of rs3765728 and rs34011 in 1,083 Chinese subjects including 429 unrelated sporadic AD patients and 654 unrelated age and gender-matched control subjects. We found that the genotype distribution of rs34011 was significantly different between AD and control group (Ï‡(2) = 9.048, df = 2, P = 0.011). Logistic regression manifested the risk of AD increased in TT genotype carriers in total subjects (Wald = 8.892, df = 1, P = 0.003, odds ratio [OR]:2.009, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.270-3.178). This effect was also found in APOE Ïµ4 carrier group (Wald = 7.844, df = 1, P = 0.005, OR: 4.201, 95%CI: 1.539-11.472), suggesting the rs34011 has a synergetic effect of APOE on AD risk. However, no association was observed between rs3765728 and AD in the Han Chinese population (Ï‡(2)â€‰= 0.431, df = 2, P = 0.806). 
24503708	Increased expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products in neurons and astrocytes in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Exp. Mol. Med. 20140207 2014
The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been reported to have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated RAGE levels in the hippocampus and cortex of a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) using western blotting and immunohistochemical double-labeling to assess cellular localization. Analysis of western blots showed that there were no differences in the hippocampal and cortical RAGE levels in 10-month-old adult 3xTg-AD mice, but significant increases in RAGE expression were found in the 22- to 24-month-old aged 3xTg-AD mice compared with those of age-matched controls. RAGE-positive immunoreactivity was observed primarily in neurons of aged 3xTg-AD mice with very little labeling in non-neuronal cells, with the notable exception of RAGE presence in astrocytes in the hippocampal area CA1. In addition, RAGE signals were co-localized with the intracellular amyloid precursor protein (APP)/amyloid beta (AÎ²) but not with the extracellular APP/AÎ². In aged 3xTg-AD mice, expression of human tau was observed in the hippocampal area CA1 and co-localized with RAGE signals. The increased presence of RAGE in the 3xTg-AD animal model showing critical aspects of AD neuropathology indicates that RAGE may contribute to cellular dysfunction in the AD brain.  
24164733	Differential effects of current specific treatments on behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a 12-month, randomized, open-label trial.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in up to 80% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and represent one of the most common reasons for early institutionalization and increase in management costs. Objectives: This study evaluated the effects of four drugs (memantine, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) in BPSD in AD patients. This was a prospective, longitudinal, randomized, open-label, 4-arm, parallel-group, 12-month clinical trial carried out in 177 AD patients. The severity of BPSD was evaluated at baseline and after treatment with memantine (n = 48), donepezil (n = 42), rivastigmine (n = 46), and galantamine (n = 41), by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) scales. The NPI and BEHAVE-AD total scores improved from baseline to month 12 in all groups. The improvements in both scales were statistically significant in the memantine, donepezil, and rivastigmine groups, but not in the galantamine group. Responder analyses showed that treatment with memantine and rivastigmine resulted in more patients improving on NPI and BEHAVE-AD score, respectively. Agitation/aggression was the NPI item with the highest improvements (significantly versus baseline in the memantine and in the rivastigmine groups), while aggression and anxiety/phobias were the mostly improved BEHAVE-AD items (significantly in the rivastigmine group for both and in the rivastigmine group only for anxiety/phobias). All treatments were well tolerated: most of adverse events reported were transient and of mild-to-moderate intensity. This study suggests that specific drugs for AD, especially memantine and rivastigmine, may be effective in the improvement of BPSD in patients with mild to moderate AD, without major side effects. 
24217273	Discrepancies regarding the quality of life of patients with Alzheimer's disease: a three-year longitudinal study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Cross-sectional studies report notable discrepancies between patient and caregiver ratings of the quality of life of patients (QoL-p) with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to identify the factors associated with any changes in QoL-p ratings and any discrepancies between patient and caregiver ratings of QoL-p. Three-year follow-up of a cohort of non-institutionalized patients (n = 119). QoL-p was assessed by the Quality of Life in AD (QoL-AD) scale. We analyzed the influence of functional and cognitive status and behavioral problems in patients, and burden and mental health in caregivers. Repeated measures analysis was applied to the scores of patients and caregivers on the QoL-AD, and to the discrepancies between them. Generally, patients' own ratings remained stable over time (F3,116 = 0.9, p = 0.439), whereas caregiver ratings showed a decline (F3,116 = 9.4, p &lt; 0.001). In the analysis of discrepancies, patients with anosognosia gave higher ratings (F1,117 = 11.9, p = 0.001), whereas caregiver ratings were lower when the patient showed greater agitation (F1,117 = 13.0, p &lt; 0.001), apathy (F1,117 = 15.4, p &lt; 0.001), and disabilities (F1,117 = 17.1, p &lt; 0.001), and when the caregiver experienced greater burden (F1,117 = 9.0, p = 0.003) and worse mental health (F1,117 = 10.1, p = 0.003). Patient ratings of QoL-p remain generally stable over time, whereas those of caregivers show a decline, there being significant discrepancies in relation to specific patient and caregiver factors.  
24217274	Increased myeloperoxidase plasma levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Increasing evidence supports the role of cardiovascular risk factors in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective: In the present pilot study, we investigated plasma concentrations of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and its possible association with plasma amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)1-42/1-40 ratio in AD patients and elderly healthy controls. The study sample included 28 AD patients and 27 elderly individuals with a normal cognitive status as a control group. The Mini-Mental Status Examination was used to determine the global cognition. MPO, AÎ²1-40, and AÎ²1-42 plasma concentrations were measured by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assays. ResULTS: AD patients showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of MPO in comparison to healthy elderly controls (AD versus healthy elderly controls (mean Â± SD): 132.8 Â± 114.8 ng/mL versus 55.0 Â± 42.6 ng/mL; p = 0.002). MPO plasma concentrations showed a significant positive correlation in the whole sample with the presence of AD (Ï? = 0.428, p &lt; 0.001) and its stage (Ï? = 0.331; p = 0.013) as well as with plasma concentrations of AÎ²1-42 (Ï? = 0.406; p = 0.004) and AÎ²1-42/1-40 ratio (Ï? = 0.354; p = 0.013). In a binary logistic regression model, plasma MPO concentrations were independently associated with the presence of AD (p = 0.014). AD patients showed significantly increased plasma levels of MPO, which could be an important molecular link between atherosclerosis and AD. Further studies should evaluate whether MPO may also be a useful biomarker and potential new treatment target in AD. 
24217277	Differentially disrupted functional connectivity in posteromedial cortical subregions in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have remarkable focal grey matter loss and hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex (PMC), which is composed of the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, suggesting an important association of the PMC with AD pathophysiology. Studies have also shown that the PMC is a structurally and functionally heterogeneous structure containing various subregions with distinct connectivity profiles. However, whether these PMC subregions show differentially disrupted connectivity patterns in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we addressed this issue by collecting resting-state functional MRI data from 32 AD patients and 38 healthy controls. We automatically identified the PMC subregions using a graph-based module detection algorithm and then mapped the whole-brain functional connectivity pattern of each subregion. The functional connectivity analysis was followed by a hierarchical clustering analysis to classify each subregion. Three distinct spatial connectivity patterns were observed across the PMC subregions: the anterior dorsal zone was functionally connected with the sensorimotor cortex; the posterior dorsal zone was functionally connected with the frontoparietal cortex; and the central and ventral zones were functionally connected with the default-mode regions. Group comparison analysis revealed that all three functional systems were significantly disrupted in the AD patients compared to the controls and these disruptions were positively correlated with the patients' cognitive performance. Collectively, we showed that the subregions of the PMC exhibit differentially disrupted neuronal circuitry in AD patients, which provides new insight into the functional neuroanatomy of the human PMC and the alterations that may be relevant to disease.  
24217278	Jugular venous reflux and white matter abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease: a pilot study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
To determine whether jugular venous reflux (JVR) is associated with cerebral white matter changes (WMCs) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we studied 12 AD patients 24 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 17 elderly age- and gender-matched controls. Duplex ultrasonography and 1.5T MRI scanning was applied to quantify cerebral WMCs [T2 white matter (WM) lesion and dirty-appearing-white-matter (DAWM)]. Subjects with severe JVR had more frequently hypertension (p = 0.044), more severe WMC, including increased total (p = 0.047) and periventricular DAWM volumes (p = 0.008), and a trend for increased cerebrospinal fluid volumes (p = 0.067) compared with the other groups. A significantly decreased (65.8%) periventricular DAWM volume (p = 0.01) in the JVR-positive AD individuals compared with their JVR-negative counterparts was detected. There was a trend for increased periventricular and subcortical T2 WMC lesion volumes in the JVR-positive AD individuals compared with their JVR-negative counterparts (p = 0.073). This phenomenon was not observed in either the control or MCI groups. In multiple regression analysis, the increased periventricular WMC lesion volume and decreased DAWM volume resulted in 85.7% sensitivity and 80% specificity for distinguishing between JVR-positive and JVR-negative AD patients. These JVR-WMC association patterns were not seen in the control and MCI groups. Therefore, this pilot study suggests that there may be an association between JVR and WMCs in AD patients, implying that cerebral venous outflow impairment might play a role in the dynamics of WMCs formation in AD patients, particularly in the periventricular regions. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm and validate our findings.  
24217280	Increased cerebrospinal fluid tau levels in logopenic variant of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Patients with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) display neuropathological differences from typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study was to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels between patients with lvPPA due to AD (lvPPA-AD), non-logopenic forms of AD (nlAD), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment due to AD (aMCI-AD). CSF biomarker concentrations were assessed in 124 patients divided into three groups matched for age, level of education, center, and disease duration: lvPPA-AD (n = 30), nlAD (n = 67). and aMCI-AD (n = 27). Results: p-Tau181 levels were higher in the lvPPA-AD group than in the aMCI-AD group (p &lt; 0.05). Total tau levels were higher in the lvPPA-AD group versus those in the nlAD (p &lt; 0.05) and aMCI-AD (p &lt; 0.001) groups. These results suggest a more pronounced involvement of a taupathy in lvPPA-AD compared to aMCI-AD and a more important neuronal death in lvPPA-AD than in nlAD or aMCI-AD. 
24240640	Structural diversity of Alzheimer's disease amyloid-Î² dimers and their role in oligomerization and fibril formation.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the formation of toxic amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)42 oligomers, and recent evidence supports a role for AÎ² dimers as building blocks for oligomers. Molecular dynamics simulation studies have identified clans for the dominant conformations of AÎ²42 forming dimers; however, it is unclear if a larger spectrum of dimers is involved and which set(s) of dimers might evolve to oligomers verse fibrils. Therefore, for this study we generated multiple structural conformations of AÎ²42, using explicit all-atom molecular dynamics, and then clustering the different structures based on key conformational similarities. Those matching a selection threshold were then used to model a process of oligomerization. Remarkably, we showed a greater diversity in AÎ² dimers than previously described. Depending on the clan family, different types of AÎ² dimers were obtained. While some had the tendency to evolve into oligomeric rings, others formed fibrils of diverse characteristics. Then we selected the dimers that would evolve to membranephilic annular oligomers. Nearly one third of the 28 evaluated annular oligomers had the dimer interfaces between the neighboring AÎ²42 monomers with possible salt bridges between the residue K28 from one side and either residue E22 or D23 on the other. Based on these results, key amino acids were identified for point mutations that either enhanced or suppressed the formation and toxicity of oligomer rings. Our studies suggest a greater diversity of AÎ² dimers. Understanding the structure of AÎ² dimers might be important for the rationale design of small molecules that block formation of toxic oligomers.  
24246418	Polygenic risk for Alzheimer's disease is not associated with cognitive ability or cognitive aging in non-demented older people.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-pathological cognitive aging have phenotypic similarities which may be influenced by an overlapping set of genetic variants. Genome-wide complex trait analysis estimates that common genetic variants account for about 24% of the variation contributing to liability for AD. It is also estimated that 24% of the variance of non-pathological cognitive aging is accounted for by common single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, although the APOE locus is associated with both AD and cognitive aging, it is not known to what extent other common genetic variants, with smaller effect sizes that influence both, overlap. We test the hypothesis that polygenic risk for AD is associated with cognitive ability and cognitive change in about 3,000 non-demented older people (Cognitive Ageing Genetics England and Scotland-CAGES-consortium). We found no significant association of polygenic risk for AD with cognitive ability or cognitive change in CAGES, indicating that the genetic etiologies of AD and non-pathological cognitive decline differ.  
24254701	Neuropsychological correlates of behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease, frontal variant of frontotemporal, subcortical vascular, and lewy body dementias: a comparative study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The aim of this study was to investigate the neuropsychological correlates of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) in patients affected by various forms of dementia, namely Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontal-variant frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD). 21 fvFTD, 21 LBD, 22 AD, and 22 SIVD patients matched for dementia severity received a battery of neuropsychological tests and the Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI). The possible association between performance on neuropsychological tests and severity of BPSD was assessed by correlational analysis and multivariate regression. BPSD were present in 99% of patients. Most behavioral symptoms were not related to a particular dementia group or to a specific cognitive deficit. Euphoria and disinhibition were predicted by fvFTD diagnosis. Hallucinations correlated with the severity of visuospatial deficits in the whole sample of patients and were predicted by LBD diagnosis. Apathy, which was found in all dementia groups, correlated with executive functions and was predicted by both reduced set-shifting aptitude and fvFTD diagnosis. The results confirm the high prevalence of BPSD in the mild to moderate stages of dementia and show that most BPSD are equally distributed across dementia groups. Most of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms are independent dimensions of the dementia syndromes. Nevertheless, hallucinations in LBD and euphoria and disinhibition in fvFTD are related to the structural brain alterations that are responsible for cognitive decline in these dementia groups. Finally, apathy arises from damage in the frontal cortical areas that are also involved in executive functions.  
24254702	Neurobiological correlates of apathy in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a critical review.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), apathy was associated with faster clinical deterioration. Studies involving neurobiological correlates such as neuroimaging and biomarkers have presented distinct results. This work aimed to analyze neurobiological correlates of apathy in AD and MCI based on evidence from the literature involving brain neuroimaging and classical AD biomarkers. Methods: This review comprised studies published from 1996 to June 2013 from the Pubmed database. The studies were divided into Part I (neuroimaging) and Part II (chemical biomarkers). The analysis included the identification of brain regions involved and assessments of apathy and cognition. We found 68 publications: 33 fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 35 were case reports or were not clear about the measurements of apathy and were excluded. From the 33 eligible studies, 26 were classified into part I, and 7 studies were included in part II. We created specific criteria to appropriately classify the quality level of each publication. Prefrontal regions and the anterior cingulate were the leading brain areas associated with apathy in AD and MCI. Other regions, including cortical and subcortical structures, have also been implicated in this syndrome. Abnormalities in frontal regions (associated with impairments in planning and decision making) and anterior cingulate (related to emotional blunting and loss of motivation) were the crucial structures associated with apathy in AD and MCI. 
24270205	Hippocampal sclerosis of aging is a key Alzheimer's disease mimic: clinical-pathologic correlations and comparisons with both alzheimer's disease and non-tauopathic frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) neuropathology was observed in more than 15% of aged individuals in prior studies. However, much remains unknown about the clinical correlates of HS-Aging pathology or the association(s) between HS-Aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology. Clinical and comorbid pathological features linked to HS-Aging pathology were analyzed using National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data. From autopsy data extending back to 1990 (n = 9,817 participants), the neuropathological diagnoses were evaluated from American AD Centers (ADCs). Among participants who died between 2005-2012 (n = 1,422), additional analyses identified clinical and pathological features associated with HS-Aging pathology. We also compared cognitive testing and longevity outcomes between HS-Aging cases and a subsample with non-tauopathy FTLD (n = 210). Reporting of HS-Aging pathology increased dramatically among ADCs in recent years, to nearly 20% of autopsies in 2012. Participants with relatively "pure" HS-Aging pathology were often diagnosed clinically as having probable (68%) or possible (15%) AD. However, the co-occurrence of HS-Aging pathology and AD neuropathology (AD-NP) did not indicate any pattern of correlation between the two pathologies. Compared with other pathologies, participants with HS-Aging pathology had higher overall cognitive/functional ability (versus AD-NP) and verbal fluency (versus both AD-NP and FTLD) but similar episodic memory impairment at one clinic visit 2-5 years prior to death. Patients with HS-Aging live considerably longer than patients with non-tauopathy FTLD. We conclude that the manifestations of HS-Aging, increasingly recognized in recent years, probably indicate a separate disease process of direct relevance to patient care, dementia research, and clinical trials.  
23929807	The hard Test Your Memory. Evaluation of a short cognitive test to detect mild Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130808 2014Mar
The aim of this study is the evaluation of a novel cognitive test, the hard Test Your Memory (H-TYM), in the detection of mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This paper uses a prospective study in an outpatient memory clinic. We recruited 97 patients with a diagnosis of mild AD or aMCI aged between 50 and 80â€‰years. All scored 20 or more on the mini mental state examination (MMSE). We recruited 200 controls from a similar background. The patients were given a novel short cognitive test (H-TYM) designed to test recall of newly learnt visual and verbal material together with the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment Revised, MMSE, and TYM test. Alzheimer's disease/aMCI patients completed the H-TYM with an average recall score of 6.69 (SD 3.45); control participants scored an average of 20.4 (SD 4.54). The H-TYM detected 95% of cases of mild AD/aMCI on the basis of an optimum cutoff point. The area under the receiver operating characteristic for the H-TYM ratio was calculated to be 0.989 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.980-0.997. The H-TYM test has an excellent ability to discriminate between AD/aMCI cases and healthy controls. The H-TYM is a useful tool for the detection of mild AD/aMCI, and it detects AD/aMCI in the majority of patients who "pass" the MMSE and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment Revised. 
24634832	ApoE4 effects on automated diagnostic classifiers for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroimage Clin 20140104 2014
Biomarkers are the only feasible way to detect and monitor presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). No single biomarker can predict future cognitive decline with an acceptable level of accuracy. In addition to designing powerful multimodal diagnostic platforms, a careful investigation of the major sources of disease heterogeneity and their influence on biomarker changes is needed. Here we investigated the accuracy of a novel multimodal biomarker classifier for differentiating cognitively normal (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects with and without stratification by ApoE4 genotype. 111 NC, 182 MCI and 95 AD ADNI participants provided both structural MRI and CSF data at baseline. We used an automated machine-learning classifier to test the ability of hippocampal volume and CSF AÎ², t-tau and p-tau levels, both separately and in combination, to differentiate NC, MCI and AD subjects, and predict conversion. We hypothesized that the combined hippocampal/CSF biomarker classifier model would achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating between the three diagnostic groups and that ApoE4 genotype will affect both diagnostic accuracy and biomarker selection. The combined hippocampal/CSF classifier performed better than hippocampus-only classifier in differentiating NC from MCI and NC from AD. It also outperformed the CSF-only classifier in differentiating NC vs. AD. Our amyloid marker played a role in discriminating NC from MCI or AD but not for MCI vs. AD. Neurodegenerative markers contributed to accurate discrimination of AD from NC and MCI but not NC from MCI. Classifiers predicting MCI conversion performed well only after ApoE4 stratification. Hippocampal volume and sex achieved AUCÂ =Â 0.68 for predicting conversion in the ApoE4-positive MCI, while CSF p-tau, education and sex achieved AUCÂ =Â 0.89 for predicting conversion in ApoE4-negative MCI. These observations support the proposed biomarker trajectory in AD, which postulates that amyloid markers become abnormal early in the disease course while markers of neurodegeneration become abnormal later in the disease course and suggests that ApoE4 could be at least partially responsible for some of the observed disease heterogeneity.  
24648641	The Effect of tDCS on Cognition and Neurologic Recovery of Rats with Alzheimer's Disease.
J Phys Ther Sci 20140228 2014Feb
[Purpose] This study examined the effect of the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on neurologic recovery and cognitive function of rats with Alzheimer-like dementia induced by scopolamine injections. [Subjects] To create a cognition dysfunction model, intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine was given to Sprague-Dawley rats that subsequently received tDCS for 4 weeks. [Methods] Changes in motor behavior were evaluated by conducting an open field test. Acetylcholine content in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was examined for a biochemical assessment. [Results] With respect to changes in motor behavior, group II showed the most meaningful difference after scopolamine injection, followed by group III. In the biochemical assessment, the results of the examination of acetylcholine content in the tissue of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus on the 14th and 28th days, respectively, showed the most significant increase in group II, followed by group III. [Conclusion] The above findings confirm that tDCS application after the onset of cognitive dysfunction caused by Alzheimer's disease leads to a positive effect on motor behavior and biochemical changes, and this effect is maintained over a specific period of time.  
24653696	What is the role of spatial processing in the decline of episodic memory in Alzheimer's disease? The "mental frame syncing" hypothesis.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140310 2014
The current theories on episodic memory suggest a crucial role of spatial processing for an effective retrieval. For a successful episodic recall, the long-term allocentric scene has to be translated into an egocentric scene. Here, we argue that a crucial role for an episodic retrieval is played by a "mental frame syncing" between two kinds of allocentric representations. This neurocognitive process allows an effective retrieval of our past experiences by synchronizing the allocentric view-point independent representation with the allocentric view-point dependent representation. If the "mental frame syncing" stops, even momentarily, it is difficult to reconstruct a coherent spatial scaffold upon which to effectively retrieve our previous events within an egocentric perspective. This is what apparently happens in Alzheimer's disease: a break in the "mental frame syncing" between these two kinds of allocentric representations, underpinned by damage to the hippocampus, may contribute significantly to the early deficit in episodic memory.  
24211070	Influence of population versus convenience sampling on sample characteristics in studies of cognitive aging.
Ann Epidemiol 20131012 2014Jan
We examined whether differences in findings of studies examining mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were associated with recruitment methods by comparing sample characteristics in two contemporaneous Australian studies, using population-based and convenience sampling. The Sydney Memory and Aging Study invited participants randomly from the electoral roll in defined geographic areas in Sydney. The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing recruited cognitively normal (CN) individuals via media appeals and MCI participants via referrals from clinicians in Melbourne and Perth. Demographic and cognitive variables were harmonized, and similar diagnostic criteria were applied to both samples retrospectively. CN participants recruited via convenience sampling were younger, better educated, more likely to be married and have a family history of dementia, and performed better cognitively than those recruited via population-based sampling. MCI participants recruited via population-based sampling had better memory performance and were less likely to carry the apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele than clinically referred participants but did not differ on other demographic variables. A convenience sample of normal controls is likely to be younger and better functioning and that of an MCI group likely to perform worse than a purportedly random sample. Sampling bias should be considered when interpreting findings. 
24481061	Apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1): potential as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Mol Sci 20140129 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by a decline in memory and cognitive function. Clinical manifestations of AD are closely associated with the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a mediator of the MAPK pathway, which regulates various cellular responses such as apoptosis, cell survival, and differentiation. Accumulating evidence indicates that ASK1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease and AD. Of particular interest, ASK1 is associated with many signaling pathways, which include endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis, AÎ²-induced neurotoxicity, tau protein phosphorylation, and insulin signal transduction. Here, we review experimental evidence that links ASK1 signaling and AD pathogenesis and propose that ASK1 might be a new point of therapeutic intervention to prevent or treat AD.  
24505314	Contrasting prefrontal cortex contributions to episodic memory dysfunction in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
PLoS ONE 20140204 2014
Recent evidence has questioned the integrity of episodic memory in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), where recall performance is impaired to the same extent as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While these deficits appear to be mediated by divergent patterns of brain atrophy, there is evidence to suggest that certain prefrontal regions are implicated across both patient groups. In this study we sought to further elucidate the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventromedial (VMPFC) prefrontal contributions to episodic memory impairment in bvFTD and AD. Performance on episodic memory tasks and neuropsychological measures typically tapping into either DLPFC or VMPFC functions was assessed in 22 bvFTD, 32 AD patients and 35 age- and education-matched controls. Behaviourally, patient groups did not differ on measures of episodic memory recall or DLPFC-mediated executive functions. BvFTD patients were significantly more impaired on measures of VMPFC-mediated executive functions. Composite measures of the recall, DLPFC and VMPFC task scores were covaried against the T1 MRI scans of all participants to identify regions of atrophy correlating with performance on these tasks. Imaging analysis showed that impaired recall performance is associated with divergent patterns of PFC atrophy in bvFTD and AD. Whereas in bvFTD, PFC atrophy covariates for recall encompassed both DLPFC and VMPFC regions, only the DLPFC was implicated in AD. Our results suggest that episodic memory deficits in bvFTD and AD are underpinned by divergent prefrontal mechanisms. Moreover, we argue that these differences are not adequately captured by existing neuropsychological measures.  
24461494	Synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of ebselen derivatives as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimics and cholinesterase inhibitors against Alzheimer's disease.
Bioorg. Med. Chem. 20140109 2014Feb15
A series of ebselen derivatives were designed, synthesised and evaluated as inhibitors of cholinesterases (ChEs) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimics. Most of the compounds were found to be potent against AChEs and BuChE, compounds 5e and 5i, proved to be the most potent against AChE with ICâ‚…â‚€ values of 0.76 and 0.46 Î¼M, respectively. Among these hybrids, most of the compounds were found to be good GPx mimics compare with ebselen. The selected compounds 5e and 5i were also used to determine the catalytic parameters and in vitro hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity. The results indicate that compounds 5e and 5i may be excellent multifunctional agents for the treatment of AD. 
24378710	Cannabinoid agonists showing BuChE inhibition as potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20131207 2014Feb12
Designing drugs with a specific multi-target profile is a promising approach against multifactorial illnesses as Alzheimer's disease. In this work, new indazole ethers that possess dual activity as both cannabinoid agonists CB2 and inhibitors of BuChE have been designed by computational methods. On the basis of this knowledge, the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking studies of a new class of indazoles has been performed. Pharmacological evaluation includes radioligand binding assays with [(3)H]-CP55940 for CB1R and CB2R and functional activity for cannabinoid receptors on isolated tissue. Additionally, inÂ vitro inhibitory assays of AChE/BuChE and the corresponding competition studies have been carried out. The results of pharmacological tests have revealed that three of these derivatives behave as CB2 cannabinoid agonists and simultaneously show BuChE inhibition. In particular, compounds 3 and 24 have emerged as promising candidates as novel cannabinoids that inhibit BuChE by a non-competitive or mixed mechanism, respectively. On the other hand, both molecules show antioxidant properties.  
23238869	Amyloid and its association with default network integrity in Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Brain Mapp 20121214 2014Mar
The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between functional connectivity and Î²-amyloid depositions in the default mode network (DMN) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy elderly. Twenty-five patients with AD, 12 patients with MCI, and 18 healthy controls were included in the study. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess functional connectivity in the DMN. In parallel, amyloid burden was measured in the same subjects using positron emission tomography with carbon-11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B as amyloid tracer. Functional connectivity of the DMN and amyloid deposition within the DMN were not associated across all subjects or within diagnostic groups. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine if amyloid depositions precede aberrant functional connectivity in the DMN. 
23307487	Predicting effective connectivity from resting-state networks in healthy elderly and patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Brain Mapp 20130110 2014Mar
Using functional neuroimaging techniques two aspects of functional integration in the human brain have been investigated, functional connectivity and effective connectivity. In this study we examined both connectivity types in parallel within an executive attention network during rest and while performing an attention task. We analyzed the predictive value of resting-state functional connectivity on task-induced effective connectivity in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy elderly. We found that in healthy elderly, functional connectivity was a significant predictor for effective connectivity, however, it was frequency-specific. Effective top-down connectivity emerging from prefrontal areas was related with higher frequencies of functional connectivity (e.g., 0.08-0.15 Hz), in contrast to effective bottom-up connectivity going to prefrontal areas, which was related to lower frequencies of functional connectivity (e.g., 0.001-0.03 Hz). In patients, the prediction of effective connectivity by functional connectivity was disturbed. We conclude that functional connectivity and effective connectivity are interrelated in healthy brains but this relationship is aberrant in very early AD. 
24114572	KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 8 ameliorates Alzheimer's disease by activating Î²-catenin.
J. Mol. Neurosci. 20131011 2014Feb
A sustained loss of Wnt signaling function may be involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) induces the activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, KLF8 may be related with the risk of AD. We want to know the role of KLF8 in the development of AD. A rat brain slice model for AD was established. Quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and fluorescence staining assays were carried out to examine the effects of KLF8 on the protein expression of some important molecules, which are associated with the development of AD. The enhanced expression level of KLF8 could increase the protein expression level of Î²-catenin, which interacted with and inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB). The protein levels of KLF8 and Î²-catenin were increased, while the level of NF-ÎºB was decreased in the AD model. The inhibition of NF-ÎºB was followed by the decrease of the protein expression levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and phosphorylated tau (Phospho-Tau). The protein level of KLF8 was decreasing from stages I to IV in patients with AD. This study provides evidence that KLF8 can inhibit the progression of AD. 
23771838	Targeting estrogen receptors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Neurobiol. 20130616 2014Feb
The significantly higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women than in men has been attributed to loss of estrogen and a variety of related mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, and hormonal levels, which subsequently elucidate neuroprotective roles of estrogen against AD-related pathology. Recent studies have proposed that beneficial effects of estrogen on AD are directly linked to its ability to reduce amyloid-Î² peptides and tau aggregates, two hallmark lesions of AD. Despite high expectations, large clinical trials with postmenopausal women indicated that the beneficial effects of estrogen therapies were insignificant and, in fact, elicited adverse effects. Here, we review the current status of AD prevention and treatment using estrogens focusing on recent understandings of their biochemical links to AD pathophysiology. This review also discusses development of selective ligands that specifically target either estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±) or ERÎ² isoforms, which are potentially promising strategies for safe and efficient treatment of AD.  
23853041	Amyloid precursor protein mutation disrupts reproductive experience-enhanced normal cognitive development in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Neurobiol. 20130714 2014Feb
Women experience dramatic changes in hormones, mood and cognition through different periods of their reproductive lives, particularly during pregnancy and giving birth. While limited human studies of early pregnancy and motherhood showed alteration of cognitive functions in later life, researches on rodents showed a persistent improvement of learning and memory performance in females with history of giving birth compared to virgin controls. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementia in elderly, is more prevalent in women than in men. One of the risk factors is related to the sharp reduction of estrogen in aged women. It is unknown whether the history of fertility activity plays any roles in altering risk of AD in females, such as altering cognitive function. Would reproductive experience alter the risk of AD in females? If so, what might be the mechanisms of the change? In this study, we examined the effects of reproductive experience on cognitive function in an AD transgenic mouse model (APP23) and age-matched wild-type non-transgenic control mice (WT). Our data showed an age-dependent effect of reproductive experience on learning and memory activity between breeders (had one or more litters) and non-breeders (virgins). More importantly, our data, for the first time, demonstrated a genotype-dependent effect of parity on cognitive function between APP23 and WT mice. At the age of 12Â months, WT breeders outperform non-breeders in spatial working and reference memory while APP23 breeders performed worse in spatial learning and memory than age-matched APP23 non-breeders. These genotype- and age-dependent effects of reproductive activity on cognitions are significantly associated with changes of neuropathology of AD in the APP23 mice, expression of proteins related to synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions in the brain.  
23853042	Targeting the mTOR signaling network for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
Mol. Neurobiol. 20130714 2014Feb
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that can sense environmental stimuli such as growth factors, energy state, and nutrients. It is essential for cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism, but dysregulation of mTOR signaling pathway is also associated with a number of human diseases. Encouraging data from experiments have provided sufficient evidence for the relationship between the mTOR signaling pathway and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Upregulation of mTOR signaling pathway is thought to play an important role in major pathological processes of AD. The mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin have been proven to ameliorate the AD-like pathology and cognitive deficits effectively in a broad range of animal models. Application of mTOR inhibitors indicates the potential value of reducing mTOR activity as an innovative therapeutic strategy for AD. In this review, we will focus on the recent process in understanding mTOR signaling pathway and the vital involvement of this signaling pathway in the pathology of AD, and discuss the application of mTOR inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD.  
23982747	CD33 in Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Neurobiol. 20130828 2014Feb
The amyloid-beta peptide (AÎ²) cascade hypothesis posits that AÎ² accumulation is the fundamental initiator of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mounting evidence suggests that impaired AÎ² clearance rather than its overproduction is the major pathogenic event for AD. Recent genetic studies have identified cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33) as a strong genetic locus linked to AD. As a type I transmembrane protein, CD33 belongs to the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, mediating the cell-cell interaction and inhibiting normal functions of immune cells. In the brain, CD33 is mainly expressed on microglial cells. The level of CD33 was found to be increased in the AD brain, which positively correlated with amyloid plaque burden and disease severity. More importantly, CD33 led to the impairment of microglia-mediated clearance of AÎ², which resulted in the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. In this article, we review the recent epidemiological findings of CD33 that related with AD and discuss the levels and pathogenic roles of CD33 in this disease. Based on the contributing effects of CD33 in AD pathogenesis, targeting CD33 may provide new opportunities for AD therapeutic strategies.  
23996345	intracerebroventricular streptozotocin exacerbates Alzheimer-like changes of 3xTg-AD mice.
Mol. Neurobiol. 20130831 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves several possible molecular mechanisms, including impaired brain insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. To investigate the role of metabolic insults in AD, we injected streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic compound if used in the periphery, into the lateral ventricle of the 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice and studied the cognitive function as well as AD-like brain abnormalities, such as tau phosphorylation and AÎ² accumulation, 3-6 weeks later. We found that STZ exacerbated impairment of short-term and spatial reference memory in 3xTg-AD mice. We also observed an increase in tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation, a disturbance of brain insulin signaling, and a decrease in synaptic plasticity and amyloid Î² peptides in the brain after STZ treatment. The expression of 20 AD-related genes, including those involved in the processing of amyloid precursor protein, cytoskeleton, glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, synaptic function, protein kinases, and apoptosis, was altered, suggesting that STZ disturbs multiple metabolic and cell signaling pathways in the brain. These findings provide experimental evidence of the role of metabolic insult in AD. 
24210593	Why Alzheimer trials fail: removing soluble oligomeric beta amyloid is essential, inconsistent, and difficult.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131019 2014May
Before amyloid formation, peptides cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) exist as soluble oligomers. These are extremely neurotoxic. Their concentration is strongly correlated with synaptic impairment in animals and parallel cognitive decline in animals and humans. Clinical trials have largely been aimed at removing insoluble beta amyloid in senile plaques and have not reduced soluble load. Even treatment that should remove soluble oligomers has not consistently reduced the load. Failure to significantly improve cognition has frequently been attributed to failure of the amyloid hypothesis or to irreversible alteration in the brain. Instead, trial failures may be because of failure to significantly reduce load of toxic AÎ² oligomers. Moreover, targeting only synthesis of AÎ² peptides, only the oligomers themselves, or only the final insoluble amyloid may fail to significantly reduce soluble load because of the interrelationship between these 3 points in the amyloid cascade. Thus, treatments may fail unless trials target simultaneously all 3 points in the equation-"triple therapy". Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and other monitoring tools may in the future provide reliable measurement of soluble load. But currently, only analysis of autopsied brains can provide this data and thus enable proper evaluation and explanation of the outcome of clinical trials. These data are essential before attributing trial failures to the advanced nature of the disease or asserting that failures prove that the theory linking Alzheimer's disease to products of amyloid precursor protein is incorrect.  
24262201	Type-1 interferon signaling mediates neuro-inflammatory events in models of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131029 2014May
A neuro-inflammatory response has been implicated in human patients and animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Type-1 interferons are pleiotropic cytokines involved in the initiation and regulation of the pro-inflammatory response; however, their role in AD is unknown. This study investigated the contribution of type-1 IFN signaling in the neuro-inflammatory response to amyloid-beta (AÎ²) inÂ vitro and in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed a 2-fold increase in IFNÎ± in APP/PS1 brains compared with control brains. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction also identified increased IFNÎ± and IFNÎ² expression in human pre-frontal cortex from AD patients. InÂ vitro studies in primary neurons demonstrated AÎ²-induced type-1 IFN expression preceded that of other classical pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1-Î², and IL-6. Significantly, ablation of type-1 interferon-Î± receptor 1 expression in BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells and primary neurons afforded protection against AÎ²-induced toxicity. This study supports a role for type-1 interferons in the pro-inflammatory response and neuronal cell death in AD and suggests that blocking type-1 interferon-Î± receptor 1 maybe a therapeutic target to limit the disease progression.  
24262202	SET translocation is associated with increase in caspase cleaved amyloid precursor protein in CA1 of Alzheimer and Down syndrome patients.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131105 2014May
Caspase cleaved amyloid precursor protein (APPcc) and SET are increased and mislocalized in the neuronal cytoplasm in Alzheimer Disease (AD) brains. Translocated SET to the cytoplasm can induce tau hyperphosphorylation. To elucidate the putative relationships between mislocalized APPcc and SET, we studied their level and distribution in the hippocampus of 5 controls, 3 Down syndrome and 10 Alzheimer patients. In Down syndrome and Alzheimer patients, APPcc and SET levels were increased in CA1 and the frequency of both localizations in the neuronal cytoplasm was high in CA1, and low in CA4. As the increase of APPcc is already present at early stages of AD, we overexpressed APPcc in CA1 and the dentate gyrus neurons of adult mice with a lentiviral construct. APPcc overexpression in CA1 and not in the dentate gyrus induced endogenous SET translocation and tau hyperphosphorylation. These data suggest that increase in APPcc in CA1 neurons could be an early event leading to the translocation of SET and the progression of AD through tau hyperphosphorylation.  
24268884	Neuropep-1 ameliorates learning and memory deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the brain, and causes reduction of amyloid beta plaques.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131029 2014May
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid beta (AÎ²) deposits, hyperphosphorylated tau deposition, and cognitive dysfunction. Abnormalities in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays an important role in learning and memory formation, have been reported in the brains of AD patients. A BDNF modulating peptide (Neuropep-1) was previously identified by positional-scanning synthetic peptide combinatorial library. Here we examine the neuroprotective effects of Neuropep-1 on several inÂ vitro neurotoxic insults, and triple-transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD). Neuropep-1 protects cultured neurons against oligomeric AÎ²1-42, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, and glutamate-induced neuronal cell death. Neuropep-1 injection also significantly rescues the spatial learning and memory deficits of 3xTg-AD mice compared with vehicle-treated control group. Neuropep-1 treatment markedly increases hippocampal and cortical BDNF levels. Furthermore, we found that Neuropep-1-injected 3xTg-AD mice exhibit dramatically reduced AÎ² plaque deposition and AÎ² levels without affecting tau pathology. Neuropep-1 treatment does not alter the expression or activity of full-length amyloid precursor protein, Î±-, Î²-, or Î³-secretase, but levels of insulin degrading enzyme, an AÎ² degrading enzyme, were increased. These findings suggest Neuropep-1 may be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AD.  
24332448	Reducing iron in the brain: a novel pharmacologic mechanism of huperzine A in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131113 2014May
Huperzine A (HupA), a natural inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase derived from a plant, is a licensed anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug in China and a nutraceutical in the United States. In addition to acting as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, HupA possesses neuroprotective properties. However, the relevant mechanism is unknown. Here, we showed that the neuroprotective effect of HupA was derived from a novel action on brain iron regulation. HupA treatment reduced insoluble and soluble beta amyloid levels, ameliorated amyloid plaques formation, and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic AD mice. Also, HupA decreased beta amyloid oligomers and amyloid precursor protein levels, and increased A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease Domain 10 (ADAM10) expression in these treated AD mice. However, these beneficial effects of HupA were largely abolished by feeding the animals with a high iron diet. In parallel, we found that HupA decreased iron content in the brain and demonstrated that HupA also has a role to reduce the expression of transferrin-receptor 1 as well as the transferrin-bound iron uptake in cultured neurons. The findings implied that reducing iron in the brain is a novel mechanism of HupA in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  
23892938	The CLU gene rs11136000 variant is significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease in Caucasian and Asian populations.
Neuromolecular Med. 20130728 2014Mar
Large-scale genomewide association studies have reported that the CLU rs11136000 polymorphism is significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in people of Caucasian ancestry. Recently, this association was investigated in Asian populations (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). However, these studies reported either a weak association or no association between the rs11136000 polymorphism and AD. We believe that this discrepancy may be caused by the relatively small sample size of the previous studies and the genetic heterogeneity of the rs11136000 polymorphism in AD among different populations. For this study, we searched the PubMed and AlzGene databases. We selected 18 independent studies (6 studies of Asian populations and 12 of populations of Caucasian ancestry) that evaluated the association between the rs11136000 polymorphism and AD using a case-control experimental design. We evaluated the genetic heterogeneity of the rs11136000 polymorphism in Caucasian and Asian populations. We then investigated the rs11136000 polymorphism by a meta-analysis in Asian populations using allele, dominant, and recessive models. We identified a significant association between rs11136000 and AD with the allele model (PÂ =Â 2.00Â Ã—Â 10(-4)) and the dominant model (PÂ =Â 5.00Â Ã—Â 10(-3)). Meanwhile, a similar genetic risk of the rs11136000 polymorphism in AD was observed in Asian and Caucasian populations. Further meta-analysis in pooled Asian and Caucasian populations indicated a more significant association with the allele (PÂ =Â 8.30Â Ã—Â 10(-24)), dominant (PÂ =Â 4.46Â Ã—Â 10(-17)), and recessive (PÂ =Â 3.92Â Ã—Â 10(-12)) models. Collectively, our findings from this meta-analysis indicate that the effect of the CLU rs11136000 polymorphism on AD risk in Asian cohorts (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) is consistent with the protective effect observed in Caucasian AD cohorts.  
24101586	Lysosomal network proteins as potential novel CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
Neuromolecular Med. 20131008 2014Mar
The success of future intervention strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) will likely rely on the development of treatments starting early in the disease course, before irreversible brain damage occurs. The pre-symptomatic stage of AD occurs at least one decade before the clinical onset, highlighting the need for validated biomarkers that reflect this early period. Reliable biomarkers for AD are also needed in research and clinics for diagnosis, patient stratification, clinical trials, monitoring of disease progression and the development of new treatments. Changes in the lysosomal network, i.e., the endosomal, lysosomal and autophagy systems, are among the first alterations observed in an AD brain. In this study, we performed a targeted search for lysosomal network proteins in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thirty-four proteins were investigated, and six of them, early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1), lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP-1, LAMP-2), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), Rab3 and Rab7, were significantly increased in the CSF from AD patients compared with neurological controls. These results were confirmed in a validation cohort of CSF samples, and patients with no neurochemical evidence of AD, apart from increased total-tau, were found to have EEA1 levels corresponding to the increased total-tau levels. These findings indicate that increased levels of LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LC3, Rab3 and Rab7 in the CSF might be specific for AD, and increased EEA1 levels may be a sign of general neurodegeneration. These six lysosomal network proteins are potential AD biomarkers and may be used to investigate lysosomal involvement in AD pathogenesis.  
24161345	The interactions of azure B, a metabolite of methylene blue, with acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase.
Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 20131023 2014Feb1
Methylene blue (MB) is reported to possess diverse pharmacological actions and is attracting increasing attention for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Among the pharmacological actions of MB, is the significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). These activities may, at least in part, underlie MB's beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease. MB is metabolized to yield N-demethylated products of which azure B, the monodemethyl metabolite, is the predominant species. Azure B has been shown to be pharmacologically active and also possesses a variety of biological actions. Azure B therefore may contribute to the pharmacological profile of MB. Based on these considerations, the present study investigates the possibility that azure B may, similar to MB, act as an inhibitor of human AChE and BuChE. The results document that azure B inhibits AChE and BuChE with IC50 values of 0.486Î¼M and 1.99Î¼M, respectively. The results further show that azure B inhibits AChE and BuChE reversibly, and that the modes of inhibition are most likely competitive. Although the AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities of azure B are twofold and fivefold, respectively, less potent than those recorded for MB [IC50(AChE)=0.214Î¼M; IC50(BuChE)=0.389Î¼M] under identical conditions, azure B may be a contributor to MB's in vivo activation of the cholinergic system and beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease.  
23942027	Î²-Amyloid precursor protein: function in stem cell development and Alzheimer's disease brain.
Neurodegener Dis 20130807 2014
Stem cell therapy may be a suitable approach for the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, one major impediment to the development of successful cell-based therapies is our limited understanding of the mechanisms that instruct neural stem cell behaviour, such as proliferation and cell fate specification. The Î²-amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may play an important role in neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Our recent work shows that in vitro, APP stimulates neural stem or progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. The effect on proliferation is mediated by an autocrine factor that we have identified as cystatin C. As cystatin C expression is also reported to inhibit the development of amyloid pathology in APP transgenic mice, our finding has implications for the possible use of cystatin C for the therapy of AD. 
23942061	Imaging and cognitive reserve studies predict dementia in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease subjects.
Neurodegener Dis 20130807 2014
There is strong evidence that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology starts decades before clinical onset. Cognitive reserve (CR) and brain reserve can be a good predictive model for AD development. Neuroimaging can help in describing cerebral reserves, as well as in detecting AD brain pathology before the onset of clinical dementia. Education and occupation act as proxies for CR and are associated with a lower risk of AD and delayed onset of symptoms. The apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-Îµ4 allele is a strong risk factor for AD and is associated with lower hippocampal volume even in normal aging. A fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography study of brain metabolism shows different metabolic phenotypes among subjects with different educational levels and ApoE genotypes. More highly educated subjects reach a clinical level when the cerebral areas involved in coping with network disruption are seriously impaired, and the AD-Îµ4 carriers show more global metabolic brain impairment compared with non-Îµ4 carriers. Thus, CR can counteract a genetically unfavorable background, suggesting a possible preventive strategy. AD research findings have already produced results, since recent epidemiological studies report a decreasing incidence of AD in the last years. 
23942173	How can we improve transfer of outcomes from randomized clinical trials to clinical practice with disease-modifying drugs in Alzheimer's disease?
Neurodegener Dis 20130807 2014
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for putative disease-modifying drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are using cognitive outcomes, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale--cognitive subscale, activities of daily living scales, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living, and time from mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia. It was the aim of this study to build clinically relevant outcomes for future use in clinical practice into RCT designs and help third-party payers to measure benefit. We used a literature review for analysis. The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) appears to be the most reliable primary outcome for RCT at different stages of AD, with the Relevant Outcome Scale for Alzheimer's Disease (ROSA) as a suitable alternative. The importance of current AD biomarkers vis-Ã - vis determination of efficacy of disease-modifying drugs has yet to be established; however, it is likely that at least one amyloid-specific test will be required prior to treatment with a drug acting predominantly on Î²-amyloid (AÎ²42). Furthermore, serial MRI may be required to monitor adverse side effects associated with such drugs. Global clinical scales such as CDR-SB and ROSA should be considered for use with treatments aiming at slowing disease progression. 
23942195	Inhibition of amyloid precursor protein processing leads to downregulation of apoptotic genes in Alzheimer's disease animal models.
Neurodegener Dis 20130807 2014
We previously reported the development of site-directed monoclonal antibodies able to inhibit the initiation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing site, named 'blocking Î² site 1' (BBS1). The beneficial effect of intracerebroventricular administration of these antibodies in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) showed improvement in cognitive functions and reduction in tau and amyloid pathology. Amyloid-Î² may not be the only active component of AD neurotoxicity and may involve other proteolytic APP fragments such as the APP intracellular domain, proposed to work as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of p53 and glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK3Î²) as well as affecting several physiological processes contributing to AD pathology. We show that inhibition of the Î²-secretase cleavage site via site-directed antibodies resulted in a major reduction in phosphorylated GSK3Î² levels, which is the active form of GSK3Î², as well as in p53 levels. A therapy that is capable of reducing not only the direct hallmarks of AD but also the components that lead to neuronal apoptosis might have neuroprotective potential in AD treatment. 
23942230	MRI for iron mapping in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurodegener Dis 20130807 2014
Monitoring iron deposition became possible with new dedicated quantitative MRI sequences. These sequences hold promise to determine the role of iron in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is currently unclear as to whether iron accumulation is pathogenically involved in AD or solely represents an epiphenomenon of the neurodegenerative process. We discuss currently available MR methods for quantitative iron mapping in the brain and provide an overview of results in animal models as well as in AD patients. A short literature review was used for analysis. R2*-based imaging is the best validated technique for iron detection. Current research applications include amyloid plaque detection in postmortem brains and in transgenic animal models and quantitative iron mapping in gray matter. AD patients have increased iron levels in the putamen, pulvinar thalamus, red nucleus, hippocampus, and temporal cortex. The clinical consequences of this finding and the dynamics of iron accumulation in AD are widely unknown. MRI allows to quantitatively map iron accumulation in the brain. The clinical significance of increased iron levels in AD needs to be determined in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The advent of ultra-high field imaging in clinical applications will increase image resolution and will allow in vivo iron detection in neocortical structures in AD patients both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. 
23969422	Comparing predictors of conversion to Alzheimer's disease using the disease state index.
Neurodegener Dis 20130822 2014
The Disease State Index (DSI) is a method which interprets data originating from multiple different sources, assisting the clinician in the diagnosis and follow-up of dementia diseases. We compared the differences in accuracy in differentiating stable mild cognitive impairment (S-MCI) and progressive MCI (P-MCI) obtained from different data combinations using the DSI. We investigated 212 cases with S-MCI and 165 cases with P-MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Data from neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) were included. The combination of all parameters gave the highest accuracy (accuracy 0.70, sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.68). In the different categories, neuropsychological tests (0.65, 0.65, 0.65) and hippocampal volumetry (0.66, 0.66, 0.66) achieved the highest accuracy. In addition to neuropsychological testing, MRI is recommended to be included for differentiating S-MCI from P-MCI. APOE genotype, CSF and PET may provide some additional information. 
23970097	Possible role of dynorphins in Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive deficits.
Neurodegener Dis 20130822 2014
Expression of dynorphin, an endogenous opioid peptide, increases with age and has been associated with cognitive deficits in rodents. Elevated dynorphin levels have been reported in postmortem samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and prodynorphin (PDYN) gene polymorphisms might be linked to cognitive function in the elderly. Activation of Îº-opioid receptors by dynorphins has been associated with stress-related memory impairments. Interestingly, these peptides can also modulate glutamate neurotransmission and may affect synaptic plasticity underlying memory formation. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazol-propionate (AMPA) ionotropic glutamate receptor levels generally decrease with aging, and their function is impaired in AD. Here, we compared the impact of aging on ionotropic glutamate receptor levels in the hippocampal formation of wild-type (WT) and Pdyn knock-out (KO) mice. We observed a significant reduction in GluR1 and GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits in the hippocampal formation of 18- to 25-month-old WT mice in comparison with 6-month-old mice. Conversely, the GluR1 protein level was maintained in old Pdyn KO mice, and the NMDA NR2B subunit level was increased by 42% when compared to old WT animals. These results suggest that elevated dynorphin expression occurring during aging and AD may mediate cognitive deficits by altering the glutamatergic system integrity. 
24008840	Stress impairs synaptic plasticity in triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice: rescue by ryanodine.
Neurodegener Dis 20130904 2014
A possible contributing factor to the development of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients involves the exposure to early life stress. Objective: We explored the impact of stress on synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP) of 6-month-old triple-transgenic mice (3Ã—Tg-AD). 3Ã—Tg-AD and control (NonTg) mice were exposed to three stressors at the age of 2 and 4 months. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of hippocampal slices, in a two-pathway paradigm. Slices taken from 3Ã—Tg-AD mice exhibited significant deficits in LTP compared with NonTg slices. Early stress led to a further decrease in LTP in these mice, while it did not affect NonTg mice. LTP in 3Ã—Tg-AD and stressed 3Ã—Tg-AD mice was rescued by pre-exposure to 0.2 ÂµM ryanodine. In an attempt to find a molecular correlate for the effects of stress in the 3Ã—Tg-AD mice, we found that stressed mice have an altered ratio of AÎ²42/40 both in the cortex and hippocampus. Stress experiences in young adults may accelerate the cognitive loss in AD mice, adding another dimension to the plethora of factors that lead to AD. 
24008996	Resting-state networks in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
Neurodegener Dis 20130904 2014
While there is good evidence for altered resting-state networks, particularly the default mode network (DMN), in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment preceding AD, there are rather conflicting data on changes in the DMN in Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD with cognitive impairment. This paper will focus on DMN study results, particularly in PD, as assessed by functional MRI. 
24009040	Functional interaction between amyloid-Î² precursor protein and peripherin neurofilaments: a shared pathway leading to Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?
Neurodegener Dis 20130904 2014
The pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons, comprises aberrant accumulations of neurofilaments; mutations in the peripherin subunit of neurofilaments have been identified in some forms of ALS. Recently, the amyloid-Î² precursor protein (APP), a key element for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), was linked to ALS. Here, we provide evidence that the generation of the N-terminal fragment of APP, sAPP, relies on peripherin neurofilaments. This finding could relate to a novel molecular mechanism dysregulated in ALS and/or AD. The production and the fate of sAPP were studied with the brainstem-derived, neuronal cell line, CAD, which expresses endogenous peripherin. We show that sAPP and C-terminal fragments (CTF) are generated to a large extent in the neuronal soma. We find that sAPP, but not CTF, associates with filamentous structures that delineate the nuclear lamina, extend to the cell periphery and immunostain for peripherin. The depletion of peripherin with siRNA eliminates the filamentous immunostaining of sAPP. Our results indicate that a fraction of APP is cleaved by Î²-secretase in the soma and that the generated sAPP becomes associated with perinuclear peripherin neurofilaments. These findings link the metabolism of APP--which is dysregulated in AD--to the organization of neurofilaments--which is abnormal in ALS--and suggest a possible crosstalk/overlap between the molecular mechanisms of these diseases. 
24021538	Neuroinflammatory phenotypes and their roles in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurodegener Dis 20130906 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. While once considered immunologically privileged due to the blood-brain barrier, it is now understood that the glial cells of the brain are capable of complex inflammatory responses. The goal of the study is to assess the neuroinflammatory state of the early and late AD brain using the macrophage categorizations of M1, M2a, M2b and M2c. We used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to assess a number of inflammatory markers in the frontal cortex and cerebellar tissue from early and late AD patients. We then used neuropathological and clinical outcomes to determine whether there were any correlations. We found that the AD brain is capable of generating all macrophage-like responses. In addition, we found that early AD is distinct from late AD with respect to the inflammatory profiles expressed in the brain. Most interestingly, however, we found that the early AD samples were biased to one of two phenotypes, M1 or M2a. Heterogeneity in the neuroinflammatory state of the early AD brain. 
24080821	The inside-out amyloid hypothesis and synapse pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurodegener Dis 20130924 2014
Cumulative evidence in brains and cultured neurons of Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic mouse models, as well as in human postmortem AD brains, highlights that age-related increases in Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²), particularly in endosomes near synapses, are involved in early synapse dysfunction. Our immunoelectron microscopy and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy studies show that this early subcellular AÎ² accumulation leads to progressive AÎ² aggregation and pathology, particularly within dystrophic neurites and synapses. These studies confirm that neuritic/synaptic AÎ² accumulation is the nidus of plaque formation. AÎ²-dependent synapse pathology in AD models is modulated by synaptic activity and is plaque independent. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is normally transported down neurites and appears to be preferentially processed to AÎ² at synapses. Synapses are sites of early AÎ² accumulation and aberrant tau phosphorylation in AD, which alter the synaptic composition at early stages of the disease. Elucidating the normal role of APP, and potentially of AÎ², at synapses should provide important insights into the mechanism(s) of AÎ²-induced synapse dysfunction in AD and how to therapeutically mitigate these dysfunctions. 
24080896	Can the calcium hypothesis explain synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease?
Neurodegener Dis 20130924 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the threat of modern humankind that is provoked by increased human lifespan. Despite extensive studies on AD pathology for more than 100 years, there are no disease-preventing therapies. Growing evidence suggests the role of calcium (Ca2+) in the pathogenesis of AD. The main purpose of the article is to understand whether modern science is able to explain the synapse loss observed in early AD and discuss the role of Ca2+ hypothesis in it. Based on results obtained in our laboratory and others, we propose that familial AD-associated mutations in presenilins cause a Ca2+ overload of endoplasmic reticulum stores which leads to compensatory downregulation of the neuronal store-operated Ca2+ (nSOC) entry pathway. We propose that synaptic nSOC is necessary for the stability of mature synaptic spines and that dysfunction of this pathway may play an important role in synaptic and memory loss in AD. 
24157626	The therapeutic effects of human adipose-derived stem cells in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.
Neurodegener Dis 20131023 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, still lacking proper clinical treatment. Therefore, many researchers have focused on the possibility of therapeutic use of stem cells for AD. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from adipose tissue, are well known for their pluripotency and their ability to differentiate into multiple tissue types and have immune modulatory properties similar to those of MSCs from other origins. Because of their biological properties, ASCs can be considered for cell therapy and neuroregeneration. Our recent results clearly showed the therapeutic potential of these cells after transplantation into Tg2576 mice (an AD mouse model). Intravenously or intracerebrally transplanted human ASCs (hASCs) greatly improved the memory impairment and the neuropathology, suggesting that hASCs have a high therapeutic potential for AD. 
24192327	Employing Alzheimer disease animal models for translational research: focus on dietary components.
Neurodegener Dis 20131030 2014
Translational research needs valid animal models of disease to discover new pathogenetic aspects and treatments. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), transgenic models are of great value for AD research and drug testing. It was the aim of this study to analyze the power of dietary polyphenols against neurodegeneration by investigating the effects of oleuropein aglycone (OLE), the main phenol in the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), a key component of the Mediterranean diet (MD), in a mouse model of amyloid-Î² deposition. TgCRND8 mice (3.5 months old), expressing the mutant KM670/671NL+V717F h-Î²APP695 transgene, and wild-type (wt) mice were used to study in vivo the effects of an 8-week dietary supplementation with OLE (50 mg/kg of diet) [Grossi et al: PLoS One 2013;8:e71702], following the European Communities Council Directive 86/609 (DL 116/92) and National Guidelines (permit number: 283/2012-B). OLE administration ameliorates memory dysfunction, raises a significant autophagic response in the cortex and promotes the proliferation of newborn cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Our findings support the beneficial effects of EVOO and highlight the possibility that continuous intake of high doses of OLE, both as a nutraceutical or as a food integrator, may prevent/delay the appearance of AD and reduce the severity of its symptoms. 
24192346	Impact of Vitamin D on amyloid precursor protein processing and amyloid-Î² peptide degradation in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurodegener Dis 20131030 2014
Ninety percent of the elderly population has a vitamin D hypovitaminosis, and several lines of evidence suggest that there might be a potential causal link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a non-sufficient supply with vitamin D. However, the mechanisms linking AD to vitamin D have not been completely understood. The aim of our study is to elucidate the impact of 25(OH) vitamin D3 on amyloid precursor protein processing in mice and N2A cells utilizing very moderate and physiological vitamin D hypovitaminosis in the range of 20-30% compared to wild-type mice. We found that already under such mild conditions, amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) is significantly increased, which is caused by an increased Î²-secretase activity and BACE1 protein level. Additionally, neprilysin (NEP) expression is downregulated resulting in a decreased NEP activity further enhancing the effect of decreased vitamin D on the AÎ² level. In line with the in vivo findings, corresponding effects were found with N2A cells supplemented with 25(OH) vitamin D3. Our results further strengthen the link between AD and vitamin D3 and suggest that supplementation of vitamin D3 might have a beneficial effect in AD prevention. 
24192578	Effect of donepezil in Alzheimer disease can be measured by a computerized human analog of the Morris water maze.
Neurodegener Dis 20131030 2014
Drug development for Alzheimer disease (AD) is challenged by the success in animal models tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the subsequent failures to meet primary outcome measures in phase II or III clinical trials in patients. The human variant of MWM (hMWM) enables us to examine allocentric and egocentric navigation as in the MWM. It was the aim of this study to examine the utility of a computerized hMWM to assess the effects of donepezil in mild AD. Donepezil 5 mg/day was started after initial hMWM testing in the treated group (n = 12), and after 28 days, the dose was increased to 10 mg/day. The performance after 3 months was compared to that of a non-treated group (n = 12). Donepezil stabilized or improved the spatial navigation performance after 3 months, especially in the allocentric delayed recall subtask (p = 0.014). The computerized hMWM has the potential to measure the effects of donepezil in mild AD. It is a sensitive cognitive outcome measure in AD clinical trials. 
24192669	Relative ratio and level of amyloid-Î² 42 surrogate in cerebrospinal fluid of familial Alzheimer disease patients with presenilin 1 mutations.
Neurodegener Dis 20131030 2014
Presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations associated with familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) generally increase the amyloid-Î² 42 (AÎ²42) to AÎ²40 ratio secreted in cultured cells. Some of these mutants reduce the secretion of AÎ²40 rather than increase that of AÎ²42. Since it has been difficult to estimate AÎ²42 secretion in brains of PS1-FAD patients due to substantial AÎ²42 accumulation, it remains unknown whether the enhanced AÎ²42 to AÎ²40 ratio in brains of FAD patients is caused by elevated AÎ²42 secretion or by reduced secretion of AÎ²40. Cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of PS1-FAD patients and neurological control patients (controls) were collected. Levels of CSF amyloid precursor-like protein-1-derived AÎ²-like peptide (APL1Î²), including APL1Î²28, an AÎ²42 surrogate marker, were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and AÎ²42 secretion in the brain was estimated. The relative ratio of CSF APL1Î²28 to total APL1Î² was higher in PS1-FAD patients than in controls. Importantly, CSF APL1Î²28 was not significantly higher. However, C-terminally shorter CSF APL1Î²25 and APL1Î²27 were significantly lower in PS1-FAD patients and, as expected, so were CSF AÎ²40 and AÎ²42. A higher relative ratio of the CSF AÎ²42 surrogate in PS1-FAD patients is not due to its increase in CSF, suggesting that massive AÎ²42 accumulation in the PS1-FAD brain occurs without an apparent increase in AÎ²42 secretion. 
24192711	Sustained Alzheimer's amyloid pathology in myeloid differentiation protein-88-deficient APPswe/PS1 mice.
Neurodegener Dis 20131030 2014
Most Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases arise sporadically and may involve innate immune activation of microglial expressed Toll-like receptors regulated through the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88) pathway. It was the aim of this study to test the innate immune involvement in AD pathology. We mated APPsw/PS1Î”E9 mice with MyD88-deficient mice. Progeny mice had similar levels of soluble amyloid-Î² peptides, amyloid plaque density and neuroimmune staining patterns. However, double-transgenic mice did show a significantly reduced life expectancy. Our findings indicate that impaired innate immune responses may play a role in AD pathology. 
24401335	We can treat Alzheimer's disease successfully in mice but not in men: failure in translation? A perspective.
Neurodegener Dis 20140107 2014
Animal models closely resembling the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed for research on disease mechanisms and for drug development. No natural model of AD is available, so big hopes arose from transgenic and knockout technology, expecting that modulation and expression of pathogenetically important proteins resemble human brain pathology and functional deficits in the expected morphological and temporal pattern. The real usefulness of these models should be discussed from an objective point of view. Not a single one of the published transgenic rodent models fulfils this hope, and even complex multiple transgenic animals do not suffer from real AD. It is crucial to be aware that all of the commonly used mice and rats are just models, and therefore results from drug efficacy testing have to be interpreted with care. Repeated experience with failed trials of new treatments that previously had been published as successful in animals has led to the wrong conclusion that animal models are of low predictive value or even of no use. Often clinical trials replicate exactly what was shown in the animal proof-of-concept studies. The value of animal models depends mainly on the careful experimentation and correct interpretation of results. Appropriate planning of experiments will help to increase the predictive value in drug development programs, though this may also increase negative findings. However, the early failure may enable a faster focus on more promising strategies. 
24434947	Molecular imaging in sporadic Alzheimer's disease populations and those genetically at risk.
Neurodegener Dis 20140109 2014
The time course and order of the pathological-physiological processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still under investigation and it is expected that molecular imaging will provide important insight into early brain pathology. Multi-tracer positron emission tomography studies visualizing fibrillar amyloid, inflammatory changes including astrocytosis and activation of microglia as well as cerebral glucose metabolism indicate that AD pathological processes are initiated and ongoing decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Therefore, prevention might be a new promising target for AD therapy. 
24634656	Regions of interest computed by SVM wrapped method for Alzheimer's disease examination from segmented MRI.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140220 2014
Accurate identification of the most relevant brain regions linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial in order to improve diagnosis techniques and to better understand this neurodegenerative process. For this purpose, statistical classification is suitable. In this work, a novel method based on support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is proposed to be applied on segmented brain MRI for detecting the most discriminant AD regions of interest (ROIs). The analyses are performed both on gray and white matter tissues, achieving up to 100% accuracy after classification and outperforming the results obtained by the standard t-test feature selection. The present method, applied on different subject sets, permits automatically determining high-resolution areas surrounding the hippocampal area without needing to divide the brain images according to any common template.  
24639647	Therapeutic effects of the transplantation of VEGF overexpressing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the hippocampus of murine model of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140307 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized by progressive memory loss, behavioral and learning dysfunction and cognitive deficits, such as alterations in social interactions. The major pathological features of AD are the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles together with neuronal and vascular damage. The double transgenic mouse model of AD (2xTg-AD) with the APPswe/PS1dE9 mutations shows characteristics that are similar to those observed in AD patients, including social memory impairment, senile plaque formation and vascular deficits. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), when transplanted into the brain, produce positive effects by reducing amyloid-beta (AÎ²) deposition in transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilins1 (PS1) mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), exhibits neuroprotective effects against the excitotoxicity implicated in the AD neurodegeneration. The present study investigates the effects of MSCs overexpressing VEGF in hippocampal neovascularization, cognitive dysfunction and senile plaques present in 2xTg-AD transgenic mice. MSC were transfected with vascular endothelial growth factor cloned in uP vector under control of modified CMV promoter (uP-VEGF) vector, by electroporation and expanded at the 14th passage. 2xTg-AD animals at 6, 9 and 12 months old were transplanted with MSC-VEGF or MSC. The animals were tested for behavioral tasks to access locomotion, novelty exploration, learning and memory, and their brains were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for vascularization and AÎ² plaques. MSC-VEGF treatment favored the neovascularization and diminished senile plaques in hippocampal specific layers. Consequently, the treatment was able to provide behavioral benefits and reduce cognitive deficits by recovering the innate interest to novelty and counteracting memory deficits present in these AD transgenic animals. Therefore, this study has important therapeutic implications for the vascular damage in the neurodegeneration promoted by AD.  
24314887	Is sertraline treatment or depression remission in depressed Alzheimer patients associated with improved caregiver well being? Depression in Alzheimer's disease study 2.
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry  2014Jan
We wanted to assess if sertraline treatment (versus placebo) or remission of depression at 12 weeks (versus nonremission) in Alzheimer patients is associated with improved caregiver well being. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of sertraline for the treatment of depression in individuals with Alzheimer disease in five clinical research sites across the United States. Participants were caregivers of patients enrolled in the Depression in Alzheimer's Disease Study 2 (NÂ = 131). All caregivers received standardized psychosocial support throughout the study. Caregiver outcome measures included depression (Beck Depression Inventory), distress (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), burden (Zarit Burden Interview), and quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey). Fifty-nine percent of caregivers were spouses, 63.4% were women, and 64.1% were white. Caregivers of patients in both treatment groups had significant reductions in distress scores over the 24-week study period, but there was not a greater benefit for caregivers of patients taking sertraline. However, caregivers of patients whose depression was in remission at week 12 had greater declines in distress scores over the 24 weeks than caregivers of patients whose depression did not remit by weekÂ 12. Patient treatment with sertraline was not associated with significantly greater reductions in caregiver distress than placebo treatment. Distress but not level of depression or burden lessened for all caregivers regardless of remission status and even more so for those who cared for patients whose depression remitted. Results imply an interrelationship between caregiver distress and patient psychiatric outcomes. 
24199958	Regional white matter hyperintensities: aging, Alzheimer's disease risk, and cognitive function.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131010 2014Apr
White matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin, as seen on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging, are known to increase with age and are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cognitive implications of these common markers are not well understood. Previous research has primarily focused on global measures of WMH burden and broad localizations that contain multiple white matter tracts. The aims of this study were to determine the pattern of WMH accumulation with age, risk for AD, and the relationship with cognitive function utilizing a voxel-wise analysis capable of identifying specific white matter regions. A total of 349 participants underwent T1-weighted and high-resolution T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing. Increasing age and lower cognitive speed and flexibility (a component of executive function), were both significantly associated with regional WMH throughout the brain. When age was controlled, lower cognitive speed and flexibility was independently associated with WMH in the superior corona radiata. Apolipoprotein E Îµ4 and parental family history of AD were not associated with higher burden of WMH. The results contribute to a larger body of literature suggesting that white matter measures are linked with processing speed, and illustrate the utility of voxel-wise analysis in understanding the effect of lesion location on cognitive function.  
24216223	Functional connectivity and graph theory in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131018 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a long preclinical phase in which amyloid and tau cerebral pathology accumulate without producing cognitive symptoms. Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated that brain networks degrade during symptomatic AD. It is unclear to what extent these degradations exist before symptomatic onset. In this study, we investigated graph theory metrics of functional integration (path length), functional segregation (clustering coefficient), and functional distinctness (modularity) as a function of disease severity. Further, we assessed whether these graph metrics were affected in cognitively normal participants with cerebrospinal fluid evidence of preclinical AD. Clustering coefficient and modularity, but not path length, were reduced in AD. Cognitively normal participants who harbored AD biomarker pathology also showed reduced values in these graph measures, demonstrating brain changes similar to, but smaller than, symptomatic AD. Only modularity was significantly affected by age. We also demonstrate that AD has a particular effect on hub-like regions in the brain. We conclude that AD causes large-scale disconnection that is present before onset of symptoms.  
24050316	Experimental traumatic brain injury induces rapid aggregation and oligomerization of amyloid-beta in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
J. Neurotrauma 20131210 2014Jan1
Soluble amyloid-beta (AÎ²) oligomers are hypothesized to be the pathogenic species in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and increased levels of oligomers in the brain subsequent to traumatic brain injury (TBI) may exacerbate secondary injury pathways and underlie increased risk of developing AD in later life. To determine whether TBI causes AÎ² aggregation and oligomerization in the brain, we exposed triple transgenic AD model mice to controlled cortical impact injury and measured levels of soluble, insoluble, and oligomeric AÎ² by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 1, 3, and 7 days postinjury. TBI rapidly increased levels of both soluble and insoluble AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 in the injured cortex at 1 day postinjury. We confirmed previous findings that identified damaged axons as a major site of AÎ² accumulation using both immunohistochemistry and biochemistry. We also report that soluble AÎ² oligomers were significantly increased in the injured cortex, as demonstrated by both ELISA and Western blot. Interestingly, the mouse brain is able to rapidly clear trauma-induced AÎ², with both soluble and insoluble AÎ² species returning to sham levels by 7 days postinjury. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TBI causes acute accumulation and aggregation of AÎ² in the brain, including the formation of low- and high-molecular-weight AÎ² oligomers. The formation and aggregation of AÎ² into toxic species acutely after injury may play a role in secondary injury cascades after trauma and, chronically, may contribute to increased risk of developing AD in later life. 
24150110	Regional differences in white matter breakdown between frontotemporal dementia and early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
White matter abnormalities have been associated with both behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures, we compared white matter integrity between patients with bvFTD and those with early-onset AD and correlated these biomarkers with behavioral symptoms involving emotional blunting. We studied 8 bvFTD and 12 AD patients as well as 12 demographically-matched healthy controls (NCs). Using four DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity), we assessed the frontal lobes (FWM) and genu of the corpus callosum (GWM), which are vulnerable late-myelinating regions, and a contrasting early-myelinating region (splenium of the corpus callosum). The Scale for Emotional Blunting Scale (SEB) was used to assess emotional functioning of the study participants. Compared to AD patients and NCs, the bvFTD subjects exhibited significantly worse FWM and GWM integrity on all four DTI metrics sensitive to myelin and axonal integrity. In contrast, AD patients showed a numerical trend toward worse splenium of the corpus callosum integrity than bvFTD and NC groups. Significant associations between SEB ratings and GWM DTI measures were demonstrated in the combined bvFTD and AD sample. When examined separately, these relationships remained robust for the bvFTD group but not the AD group. The regional DTI alterations suggest that FTD and AD are each associated with a characteristic distribution of white matter degradation. White matter breakdown in late-myelinating regions was associated with symptoms of emotional blunting, particularly within the bvFTD group. 
21871692	[Does Alzheimer's disease exist in all primates? Alzheimer pathology in non-human primates and its pathophysiological implications (II)].
Neurologia 20110825 2014 Jan-Feb
In the ageing process there are some species of non-human primates which can show some of the defining characteristics of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) of man, both in neuropathological changes and cognitive-behavioural symptoms. The study of these species is of prime importance to understand AD and develop therapies to combat this neurodegenerative disease. In this second part of the study, these AD features are discussed in the most important non-experimental AD models (Mouse Lemur -Microcebus murinus, Caribbean vervet -Chlorocebus aethiops, and the Rhesus and stump-tailed macaque -Macaca mulatta and M. arctoides) and experimental models (lesional, neurotoxic, pharmacological, immunological, etc.) non-human primates. In all these models cerebral amyloid neuropathology can occur in senility, although with different levels of incidence (100% in vervets;&lt;30% in macaques). The differences between normal and pathological (Alzheimer's) senility in these species are difficult to establish due to the lack of cognitive-behavioural studies in the many groups analysed, as well as the controversy in the results of these studies when they were carried out. However, in some macaques, a correlation between a high degree of functional brain impairment and a large number of neuropathological changes ("possible AD") has been found. In some non-human primates, such as the macaque, the existence of a possible continuum between "normal" ageing process, "normal" ageing with no deep neuropathological and cognitive-behavioural changes, and "pathological ageing" (or "Alzheimer type ageing"), may be considered. In other cases, such as the Caribbean vervet, neuropathological changes are constant and quite marked, but its impact on cognition and behaviour does not seem to be very important. This does assume the possible existence in the human senile physiological regression of a stable phase without dementia even if neuropathological changes appeared. 
23582372	[Rivastigmine as treatment for patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer disease under normal clinical practice conditions. The ENTERPRISE study].
Neurologia 20130410 2014 Jan-Feb
Alzheimer disease (AD) causes progressive cognitive decline leading to loss of independence for activities of daily living; rivastigmine is one of the drugs used for symptomatic management. To assess the therapeutic use of different pharmaceutical forms of rivastigmine in patients with AD in normal clinical practice. Cross-sectional, observational, multi-centre study conducted on patients with mild to moderate AD treated with rivastigmine in Spanish outpatient clinics specialising in Geriatrics, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Data regarding use of oral (OR) and transdermal (TDR) rivastigmine, compliance (degree of adherence), and caregiver satisfaction with treatment were evaluated. In total, 2252 patients with a mean age of 77.2 years were included; 60.2% were women. AD was moderate to moderately severe in 58.4%. Rivastigmine treatment was started orally in 54.4% of the patients and transdermally in 45.6%; 35.6% of those who started treatment by the OR route switched to TDR. A single dose adjustment was sufficient for 77.5% of patients on TDR treatment vs 11.8% of patients receiving OR treatment. More patients on TDR treatment (80.8% vs. 57.1% on OR treatment) reached the maximum therapeutic dose of rivastigmine and did so in a shorter period of time (51.6 vs 205.8 days). Compliance rates (60.5% vs 47.2%) and caregivers' satisfaction with treatment (89.4% vs 81.9%) were also higher for TDR. In normal clinical practice, using the TDR route of administration improves dose titration and drug compliance, allowing more patients to reach the maximum recommended dose of rivastigmine in a shorter time period. 
23582374	[Tractography of the uncinate fasciculus and the posterior cingulate fasciculus in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease].
Neurologia 20130410 2014 Jan-Feb
Brain tractography is a non-invasive medical imaging technique which enables in vivo visualisation and various types of quantitative studies of white matter fibre tracts connecting different parts of the brain. We completed a quantitative study using brain tractography with diffusion tensor imaging in patients with mild cognitive impairment, patients with Alzheimer disease, and normal controls, in order to analyse the reproducibility and validity of the results. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were measured across the uncinate fasciculus and the posterior cingulate fasciculus in images, obtained from a database and a research centre, representing 52 subjects distributed among the 3 study groups. Two observers took the measurements twice in order to evaluate intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. Measurements of FA and MD of the uncinate fasciculus delivered an intraclass correlation coefficient above 0.9; ICC was above 0.68 for the posterior cingulate fasciculus. Patients with Alzheimer disease showed lower values of FA and higher MD values in the right uncinate fasciculus in images from the research centre. A comparison of the measurements from the 2 centres revealed significant differences. We established a reproducible methodology for performing tractography of the tracts in question. FA and MD indexes may serve as early indicators of Alzheimer disease. The type of equipment and the method used to acquire images must be considered because they may alter results as shown by comparing the 2 data sets in this study. 
24395280	Novel effects of Rosa damascena extract on memory and neurogenesis in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurosci. Res. 20140102 2014Apr
The number of older people who are suffering from memory impairment is increasing among populations throughout the world. Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects about 5% of people over 65 years old. The hippocampus, a brain area critical for learning and memory, is especially vulnerable to damage in the early stages of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that loss of neurons and synapses are correlated with dementia in this devastating disease. Therefore, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in adulthood could serve as a preventive as well as a therapeutic target for AD. This study investigated the effect of Rosa damascena extract on neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in an animal model of AD. Molecular, cellular, and behavioral experiments revealed that this treatment could induce neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity and improve memory in AD. Our study suggests that R. damascena is a promising treatment for mild memory impairments and AD. 
24498013	Association between APOC1 polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease: a case-control study and meta-analysis.
PLoS ONE 20140131 2014
Previous association studies examining the relationship between the APOC1 polymorphism and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown conflicting results, and it is not clear if an APOC1 variant acts as a genetic risk factor in AD etiology across multiple populations. To confirm the risk association between APOC1 and AD, we designed a case-control study and also performed a meta-analysis of previously published studies. Seventy-nine patients with AD and one hundred fifty-six unrelated controls were included in case-control study. No association was found between the variation of APOC1 and AD in stage 1 of our study. However, our meta-analysis pooled a total of 2092 AD patients and 2685 controls. The APOC1 rs11568822 polymorphism was associated with increased AD risk in Caucasians, Asians and Caribbean Hispanics, but not in African Americans. APOE Îµ4 carriers harboring the APOC1 insertion allele, were more prevalent in AD patients than controls (Ï‡(2)â€Š=â€Š119.46, ORâ€Š=â€Š2.79, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š2.31-3.36, P&lt;0.01). The APOC1 insertion allele, in combination with APOE Îµ4, likely serves as a potential risk factor for developing AD. 
24445401	Is there still any hope for amyloid-based immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease?
Curr Opin Psychiatry  2014Mar
We reviewed clinical trials on active and passive anti-Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) immunotherapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with a particular focus on monoclonal antibodies against AÎ². Studies on anti-Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy published in the period from January 2012 to October 2013 were reviewed. Both active and passive anti-AÎ² immunotherapies were shown to clear brain AÎ² deposits. However, an active anti-AÎ² vaccine (AN1792) has been discontinued because it caused meningoencephalitis in 6% of Alzheimer's disease patients treated. Among passive immunotherapeutics, two Phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at the N-terminal sequence of AÎ², were disappointing. Another antibody, solanezumab, directed at the mid-region of AÎ², failed in two Phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. A third Phase III study with solanezumab is ongoing in mildly affected Alzheimer's disease patients based on encouraging results in this subgroup of patients. Second-generation active AÎ² vaccines (ACC-001, CAD106, and Affitope AD02) and new passive anti-AÎ² immunotherapies (gantenerumab and crenezumab) are being tested in prodromal Alzheimer's disease patients, in presymptomatic individuals with Alzheimer's disease-related mutations, or in asymptomatic individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease to definitely test the AÎ² cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease. 
24492450	Parallel improvement of cognitive functions and P300 latency following donepezil treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a case-control study.
J Clin Neurophysiol  2014Feb
To evaluate the effect of donepezil, one of the cholinesterase inhibitors, on P300 measurements in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and investigate the relationship between the subfactors of cognitive performance and P300 components. One hundred outpatients with AD were evaluated for cognitive function (cognitive ability screening instrument) and event-related potentials before and after 22 to 23 weeks of treatment with donepezil (5 mg/day). Twenty age-matched normal control subjects were recruited. The patients with AD showed prolonged P300 and N200 latency, no significant differences in N100 and P200 components, and poor performance in neuropsychological assessments compared with control subjects at baseline. After donepezil treatment, the patients with AD had reduction in P300 latency at Pz lead, which was associated with a parallel improvement in cognitive function in terms of remote memory, recent memory, visual instruction, and orientation. The pre-post treatment difference of P300 latency significantly correlated with the cognitive ability screening instrument score difference and recent memory score difference, respectively. The patients with AD still had intact early sensory processing but impaired higher-level cognitive processes that could influence behavior deviation. The donepezil treatment, which enhances higher-level cognitive processing time, revealed that P300 latency decreases as cognitive capability increases, especially improved in recent memory. 
24334212	GSK3Î², CREB, and BDNF in peripheral blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease and depression.
Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry 20131212 2014Apr3
Glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK3Î²), cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) play critical roles in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity and memory and participate in the pathophysiology of both depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was designed to determine the association of GSK3Î² activity, CREB activity and BDNF concentration in peripheral blood of patients with AD with or without depressive symptoms and in depressive patients without AD. GSK3Î² activity in platelets, CREB activity in lymphocytes and BDNF concentration in plasma, platelet-rich plasma or platelets were measured in 85 AD patients (36 of whom displayed co-morbid depressive symptoms), 65 non-AD patients with depressive disorder and 96 healthy controls. AD patients were clinically assessed for stage of dementia, cognitive impairment and severity of depressive symptoms. Depressive patients were clinically assessed for severity of depression. We observed increased CREB activity and GSK3Î² activity in AD with depressive symptoms or in AD at mild stage of dementia. Decreased BDNF concentration was found in platelet-rich plasma of AD patients at moderate to severe stages of dementia or in AD without depressive symptoms. An association was revealed of the severity of cognitive impairment with the increase of GSK3Î² in the platelets of AD patients with mild dementia. In depressive patients, a lower concentration of phosphorylated GSK3Î² was associated with a higher severity of depression. Association was confirmed between severity of depression, CREB activation, and BDNF concentration in drug-naÃ¯ve depressive patients. Our data demonstrated that AD is accompanied by increased CREB activity in lymphocytes and a decreased concentration of BDNF in platelet-rich plasma. The decreased BDNF concentration appears to correlate with moderate to severe stages of dementia in AD. Observation of decreased phosphorylation of GSK3Î² in platelets of both AD patients with depressive symptoms and depressive patients after treatment confirms the role of increased GSK3Î² activity in the pathophysiology of both AD and depressive disorder. Associations were confirmed between AD and platelet GSK3Î² activity, lymphocyte CREB activity and plasma BDNF. CREB activity and platelet BDNF concentration seems to be related to depressive disorder. 
24627867	Prevalence of hippocampal morphologic variants between healthy elderly subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Adv Biomed Res 20140127 2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with atrophic changes in the temporal lobe. Enlargement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, hippocampal sulcus (HS) enlargement, or an increase in the number or size of hippocampal cavities (HCs) could be associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA). In this study, we assessed the relation of these CSF spaces with AD. A total 36 demented patients with diagnosis of Alzheimer (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) â‰¤25) and 36 non-demented elderly individuals were referred for basic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initiating anti-dementia therapy in the demented group. Two observers assessed the maximal HS width, as well as the occurrence, number, and size of HCs, and the visual rating score of MTA on magnified coronal high-resolution T1-weighted MR images. The findings of our study indicate that the presence of hippocampal cavity (HC) (especially in the left side) and medial temporal lobe atrophy in demented patients was significantly higher in comparison with non-demented elderly subjects (P â‰¤ 0.05). There was a significant relationship between MTA and HS width (P = 0.003, r = 0.00323), and it also had a trend to be significant with size of HCs (P = 0.08, r = 0.00314). A correlation between MTA and number of HCs was not detected. HS width is associated with MTA in patients with AD. It may serve as a measure to evaluate MTA for identifying individuals at particularly high risk for Alzheimer progression, and could be employed for selecting subjects for clinical trials or for treatment decisions. 
24627820	Online Learning for Classification of Alzheimer Disease based on Cortical Thickness and Hippocampal Shape Analysis.
Healthc Inform Res 20140131 2014Jan
Mobile healthcare applications are becoming a growing trend. Also, the prevalence of dementia in modern society is showing a steady growing trend. Among degenerative brain diseases that cause dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common. The purpose of this study was to identify AD patients using magnetic resonance imaging in the mobile environment. We propose an incremental classification for mobile healthcare systems. Our classification method is based on incremental learning for AD diagnosis and AD prediction using the cortical thickness data and hippocampus shape. We constructed a classifier based on principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis. We performed initial learning and mobile subject classification. Initial learning is the group learning part in our server. Our smartphone agent implements the mobile classification and shows various results. With use of cortical thickness data analysis alone, the discrimination accuracy was 87.33% (sensitivity 96.49% and specificity 64.33%). When cortical thickness data and hippocampal shape were analyzed together, the achieved accuracy was 87.52% (sensitivity 96.79% and specificity 63.24%). In this paper, we presented a classification method based on online learning for AD diagnosis by employing both cortical thickness data and hippocampal shape analysis data. Our method was implemented on smartphone devices and discriminated AD patients for normal group. 
24365147	Mechanistic insights into mode of action of potent natural antagonists of BACE-1 for checking Alzheimer's plaque pathology.
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 20131221 2014Jan17
Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting in memory loss and decline in cognitive abilities. Accumulation of extracellular beta amyloidal plaques is one of the major pathology associated with this disease. Î²-Secretase or BACE-1 performs the initial and rate limiting step of amyloidic pathway in which 37-43 amino acid long peptides are generated which aggregate to form plaques. Inhibition of this enzyme offers a viable prospect to check the growth of these plaques. Numerous efforts have been made in recent years for the generation of BACE-1 inhibitors but many of them failed during the preclinical or clinical trials due to drug related or drug induced toxicity. In the present work, we have used computational methods to screen a large dataset of natural compounds to search for small molecules having BACE-1 inhibitory activity with low toxicity to normal cells. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze molecular interactions between the screened compounds and the active residues of the enzyme. Herein, we report two natural compounds of inhibitory nature active against Î²-secretase enzyme of amyloidic pathway and are potent lead molecules against Alzheimer's disease.  
24333259	Absence of amyloid-beta in lenses of Alzheimer patients: a confocal Raman microspectroscopic study.
Exp. Eye Res. 20131212 2014Feb
We have compared the protein profiles in plaques and tangles in the hippocampus of post-mortem Alzheimer brains and in opaque and clear regions in the deep cortex of eye lenses of the same donors. From the 7 Alzheimer donors studied, 1 had pronounced bilateral cortical lens opacities, 1 moderate and 5 only minor or no cortical opacities. We focused on beta-sheet levels, a hallmarking property of amyloid-beta, the major protein of plaques and tau protein, the major protein of tangles in Alzheimer brains. Confocal Raman microspectroscopy and imaging was used in combination with hierarchical cluster analysis. Plaques and tangles show high levels of beta-sheets with a beta-sheet to protein ratio of 1.67. This ratio is 1.12 in unaffected brain tissue surrounding the plaques and tangles. In the lenses this ratio is 1.17 independently of the presence or absence of opacities. This major difference in beta-sheet conformation between hippocampus and lens is supported by Congo red and immunostaining of amyloid-beta and tau which were positive for plaques and tangles in the hippocampus but fully negative for the lens irrespective of the presence or absence of opacities. In line with a previous study (Michael etÂ al., 2013) we conclude that cortical lens opacities are not typical for Alzheimer patients and are not hallmarked by accumulation of amyloid-beta, and can thus not be considered as predictors or indicators of Alzheimer disease as claimed by Goldstein etÂ al. (2003).  
24440716	miR-342-5p decreases ankyrin G levels in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse models.
Cell Rep 20140116 2014Jan30
MicroRNA alterations and axonopathy have been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in AD mouse models. We now report that miR-342-5p is upregulated in APP/PS1, PS1Î”E9, and PS1-M146V transgenic AD mice, and that this upregulation is mechanistically linked to elevated Î²-catenin, c-Myc, and interferon regulatory factor-9. The increased miR-342-5p downregulates the expression of ankyrin G (AnkG), a protein that is known to play a critical role at the axon initial segment. Thus, a specific miRNA alteration may contribute to AD axonopathy by downregulating AnkG.  
24350947	The Alzheimer pandemic: is paracetamol to blame?
Inflamm Allergy Drug Targets  2014Feb
The clinical recognition of a form of dementia closely resembling Alzheimer's disease dates from around 1800. The role of analgesics derived from coal-tar in the spread of the pandemic is traced in terms of the introduction of phenacetin (PN) in 1887; its nephrotoxicity; the observation of lesions characteristic of the disease by Fischer and Alzheimer; the discovery of paracetamol (PA) as the major metabolite of PN; the linking of kidney injury and dementia with high PN usage; and the failure of PN replacement by PA to halt and reverse the exponential, inexorable rise in the incidence of Alzheimer-type dementia. Fischer observed his first case before Alzheimer; it is proposed to rename the syndrome Fischer-Alzheimer disease (F-AD). Disease development: PA-metabolising enzymes are localised in the synaptic areas of the frontal cortex and hippocampus, where F-AD lesions arise. The initiating chemical lesions in liver poisoning comprise covalent binding of a highly reactive product of PA metabolism to proteins; similar events are believed to occur in brain, where alterations in the antigenic profiles of cerebral proteins activate the microglia. Î²-Amyloid forms, and, like PA itself, induces nitric oxide synthase. Peroxynitrite modifies cerebral proteins by nitrating tyrosine residues, further challenging the microglia and exacerbating the amyloid cascade. Spontaneous reinnervation, N-acetyl cysteine administration and tyrosine supplementation may attenuate the early stages of F-AD development. F-AD is primarily a man-made condition with PA as its principal risk factor. 
24489845	Diabetes mellitus and the risk of Alzheimer's disease: a nationwide population-based study.
PLoS ONE 20140129 2014
Possible association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been controversial. This study used a nationwide population-based dataset to investigate the relationship between DM and subsequent AD incidence. Data were collected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, which released a cohort dataset of 1,000,000 randomly sampled people and confirmed it to be representative of the Taiwanese population. We identified 71,433 patients newly diagnosed with diabetes (age 58.74 Â± 14.02 years) since January 1997. Using propensity score, we matched them with 71,311 non-diabetic subjects by time of enrollment, age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous stroke history. All the patients were followed up to December 31, 2007. The endpoint of the study was occurrence of AD. Over a maximum 11 years of follow-up, diabetic patients experienced a higher incidence of AD than non-diabetic subjects (0.48% vs. 0.37%, p&lt;0.001). After Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis, DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2.07, p&lt;0.001), age (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.10-1.12, p&lt;0.001), female gender (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46, p=0.008), hypertension (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.59, p=0.01), previous stroke history (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.28-2.50, p&lt;0.001), and urbanization status (metropolis, HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07-1.63, p=0.009) were independently associated with the increased risk of AD. Neither monotherapy nor combination therapy with oral antidiabetic medications were associated with the risk of AD after adjusting for underlying risk factors and the duration of DM since diagnosis. However, combination therapy with insulin was found to be associated with greater risk of AD (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.04-4.52, p=0.039). Newly diagnosed DM was associated with increased risk of AD. Use of hypoglycemic agents did not ameliorate the risk. 
24489866	Long-term oral administration of hop flower extracts mitigates Alzheimer phenotypes in mice.
PLoS ONE 20140129 2014
Coincident with the expanding population of aged people, the incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is rapidly increasing in most advanced countries. At present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological mechanisms proposed for AD, the "amyloid hypothesis" has been most widely accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of AÎ² is considered to be the initial event. Thus, prevention of AÎ² production would be an ideal strategy for the treatment or prevention of AD. AÎ² is produced via the proteolytic cleavage of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different enzymes, Î² and Î³-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the "amyloid hypothesis", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor Î³-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts significantly inhibit AÎ² production in cultured cells. A major component of the inhibitory activity was purified, and its chemical identity was determined by NMR to be Garcinielliptone HC. In vivo, oral administration of Hop extracts to AD model mice decreased AÎ² depositions in the cerebral cortex of the parietal lobe, hippocampus, and artery walls (amyloid angiopathy) in the brains. In a Morris water maze test, AD model mice that had daily consumed Hop extracts in their drinking water showed significant mitigation of memory impairment at ages of 9 and 12 months. Moreover, in the open field test oral administration of Hop extracts also prevented an emotional disturbance that appeared in the AD mice at 18 months. Despite lifelong consumption of Hop extracts, no deleterious side effects were observed at any age. These results support the "amyloid hypothesis", and indicate that Hop extract is a promising candidate for an effective prophylactic for AD.  
24624220	History and experience: a survey of traditional chinese medicine treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
Evid Based Complement Alternat Med 20140129 2014
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is practiced in the Chinese health care system for more than 2,000 years. In recent years, herbal medicines, which are used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) in China based on TCM or modern pharmacological theories have attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we discuss etiology and pathogenesis of AD, TCM therapy, and herbal extracts for the treatment of AD. There is evidence to suggest that TCM therapy may offer certain complementary cognitive benefits for the treatment of AD. Chinese herb may have advantages with multiple target regulation compared with the single-target antagonist in view of TCM.  
24616818	Working memory and the enactment effect in early Alzheimer's disease.
ISRN Neurol 20140128 2014
This study examines the enactment effect in early Alzheimer's disease using a novel working memory task. Free recall of action-object instruction sequences was measured in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (n = 14) and older adult controls (n = 15). Instruction sequences were read out loud by the experimenter (verbal-only task) or read by the experimenter and performed by the participants (subject-performed task). In both groups and for all sequence lengths, recall was superior in the subject-performed condition than the verbal-only condition. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease showed a deficit in free recall of recently learned instruction sequences relative to older adult controls, yet both groups show a significant benefit from performing actions themselves at encoding. The subject-performed task shows promise as a tool to improve working memory in early Alzheimer's disease.  
24225948	Characterization of intermediate steps in amyloid beta (AÎ²) production under near-native conditions.
J. Biol. Chem. 20131113 2014Jan17
Processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Î³-secretase results in generation of AÎ² peptides of different lengths ranging from 51 to 30 residues. Accumulation of AÎ² and in particular AÎ²42 is enhanced by familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) causing mutations in APP and is believed to play a pivotal role. The molecular mechanism underlying normal AÎ² production, the impact of FAD mutations on this process and how anti-amyloidogenic Î³-secretase modulators (GSMs) cause a selective decrease in AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 and an increase in shorter AÎ² peptides, however, is poorly understood. By using a combined immuno- and LC-MS-based assay we identify several major intermediates, i.e. 3- and 4-peptides that line up head to head across the entire APP transmembrane sequence from AÎ²51 to AÎ²31/AÎ²30 and from AÎ²49 to AÎ²30/31. FAD APP mutations displayed a relative increase in 3- and 4-peptides from AÎ²48 to AÎ²38 compared with AÎ²49 to AÎ²37. These findings correlate with an increase in the AÎ²42/40 ratio. GSMs caused a decrease in AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 and an increase in AÎ²37 and AÎ²38 paralleled by an increase of the intermediates AÎ²40-38 and AÎ²42-39. Collectively, these data provide a thorough characterization of all intermediate steps in AÎ² production in native cell membranes and provide key mechanistic insights to genetic and pharmacological modulation of AÎ² generation.  
24291256	Anthocyanins restore behavioral and biochemical changes caused by streptozotocin-induced sporadic dementia of Alzheimer's type.
Life Sci. 20131128 2014Feb6
The aim of this study was to analyze if the pre-administration of anthocyanin on memory and anxiety prevented the effects caused by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (icv-STZ) administration-induced sporadic dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT) in rats. Moreover, we evaluated whether the levels of nitrite/nitrate (NOx), Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase and acethylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in the cerebral cortex (CC) and hippocampus (HC) are altered in this experimental SDAT. Male Wistar rats were divided in 4 different groups: control (CTRL), anthocyanin (ANT), streptozotocin (STZ) and streptozotocin+anthocyanin (STZ+ANT). After seven days of treatment with ANT (200mg/kg; oral), the rats were icv-STZ injected (3mg/kg), and four days later the behavior parameters were performed and the animals submitted to euthanasia. A memory deficit was found in the STZ group, but ANT treatment showed that it prevents this impairment of memory (P&lt;0.05). Our results showed a higher anxiety in the icv-STZ group, but treatment with ANT showed a per se effect and prevented the anxiogenic behavior induced by STZ. Our results reveal that the ANT treatment (100Î¼M) tested displaces the specific binding of [(3)H] flunitrazepam to the benzodiazepinic site of GABAA receptors. AChE, Ca(+)-ATPase activities and NOx levels were found to be increased in HC and CC in the STZ group, which was attenuated by ANT (P&lt;0.05). STZ decreased Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity and ANT was able to prevent these effects (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that ANT is able to regulate ion pump activity and cholinergic neurotransmission, as well as being able to enhance memory and act as an anxiolytic compound in animals with SDAT. 
23728490	Compensating for synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease.
J Comput Neurosci 20130602 2014Feb
Confirming that synaptic loss is directly related to cognitive deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the focus of many studies. Compensation mechanisms counteract synaptic loss and prevent the catastrophic amnesia induced by synaptic loss via maintaining the activity levels of neural circuits. Here we investigate the interplay between various synaptic degeneration and compensation mechanisms, and abnormal cortical oscillations based on a large-scale network model consisting of 100,000 neurons exhibiting several cortical firing patterns, 8.5 million synapses, short-term plasticity, axonal delays and receptor kinetics. The structure of the model is inspired by the anatomy of the cerebral cortex. The results of the modelling study suggest that cortical oscillations respond differently to compensation mechanisms. Local compensation preserves the baseline activity of theta (5-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations whereas delta (1-4 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations are maintained via global compensation. Applying compensation mechanisms independently shows greater effects than combining both compensation mechanisms in one model and applying them in parallel. Consequently, it can be speculated that enhancing local compensation might recover the neural processes and cognitive functions that are associated with theta and alpha oscillations whereas inducing global compensation might contribute to the repair of neural (cognitive) processes which are associated with delta and beta band activity. Compensation mechanisms may vary across cortical regions and the activation of inappropriate compensation mechanism in a particular region may fail to recover network dynamics and/or induce secondary pathological changes in the network. 
24319058	Both targeted mass spectrometry and flow sorting analysis methods detected the decreased serum apolipoprotein e level in Alzheimer's disease patients.
Mol. Cell Proteomics 20131208 2014Feb
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphism has been appreciated as a valuable predictor of Alzheimer disease (AD), and the associated Îµ4 allele has been recognized as an indicator of susceptibility to this disease. However, serum ApoE levels have been a controversial issue in AD, due to the great variability regarding the different target detection methods, ethnicity, and the geographic variations of cohorts. The aim of this study was to validate serum ApoE levels in relation to AD, particularly using two distinct detection methods, liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry and microsphere-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, to overcome experimental variations. Also, comparison of serum ApoE levels was performed between the level of protein detection by FACS and peptide level by SRM in both control and AD patients. Results from the two detection methods were cross-confirmed and validated. Both methods produced fairly consistent results, showing a significant decrease of serum ApoE levels in AD patients relative to those of a control cohort (43 control versus 45 AD, p &lt; 0.0001). Significant correlation has been revealed between results from FACS and SRM (p &lt; 0.0001) even though lower serum ApoE concentration values were measured in protein by FACS analysis than in peptide-level detections by SRM. Correlation study suggested that a decrease of the serum ApoE level in AD is related to the mini-mental state exam score in both results from different experimental methods, but it failed to show consistent correlation with age, gender, or clinical dementia rating.  
23548054	Loss of person-specific knowledge in Alzheimer's disease: evidence from priming.
Neurocase 20130403 2014Jun
Semantic deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often more severe for items that are characterized by a unique semantic and lexical association, such as famous people. Whether these deficits are due to the degradation of semantic information or a deficit in the ability to intentionally access semantic knowledge remains controversial. To assess the integrity of the semantic system without explicitly accessing it, a priming paradigm was used. Semantic and repetition priming effects in individuals with AD (n = 7) and age-matched controls (n = 13) were measured in a familiarity judgment task using visually-presented names of famous people. A defective priming effect in AD subjects was observed in the semantic priming but not in the repetition priming condition. Therefore, the semantic impairments observed in AD may indicate a degraded representation of the semantic information concerning famous people.  
24380786	Comparing two different orientation strategies for promoting indoor traveling in people with Alzheimer's disease.
Res Dev Disabil 20131229 2014Feb
The present study compared two different types of orientation strategies: an assistive technology program (AT, i.e., remotely controlled sound/light devices) and a backward chaining procedure (BC) for promoting indoor traveling in four persons with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). A social validation assessment of the two strategies was also conducted employing undergraduate students as raters. For three out of four participants, AT intervention was more effective than the BC procedure, whilst for the fourth participant the two types of intervention had a comparably satisfying efficacy. A doubly Multivariate Analysis of Variance on social validation assessment data provided generally more positive scores for the AT intervention. These results suggest that AT programs (a) can be valuably employed for restoring and maintaining independence in indoor traveling in people with moderate to severe AD, and (b) might be perceived as preferable to conventional teaching strategies within daily contexts.  
23867063	Auditory post-processing in a passive listening task is deficient in Alzheimer's disease.
Clin Neurophysiol 20130715 2014Jan
To investigate whether automatic auditory post-processing is deficient in patients with Alzheimer's disease and is related to sensory gating. Event-related potentials were recorded during a passive listening task to examine the automatic transient storage of auditory information (short click pairs). Patients with Alzheimer's disease were compared to a healthy age-matched control group. A young healthy control group was included to assess effects of physiological aging. A bilateral frontal negativity in combination with deep temporal positivity occurring 500 ms after stimulus offset was reduced in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but was unaffected by physiological aging. Its amplitude correlated with short-term memory capacity, but was independent of sensory gating in healthy elderly controls. Source analysis revealed a dipole pair in the anterior temporal lobes. Results suggest that auditory post-processing is deficient in Alzheimer's disease, but is not typically related to sensory gating. The deficit could neither be explained by physiological aging nor by problems in earlier stages of auditory perception. Correlations with short-term memory capacity and executive control tasks suggested an association with memory encoding and/or overall cognitive control deficits. An auditory late negative wave could represent a marker of auditory working memory encoding deficits in Alzheimer's disease. 
24357133	Medication for Alzheimer's disease and associated fall hazard: a retrospective cohort study from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Drugs Aging  2014Feb
Falls are common in the elderly, especially in those with cognitive impairment. The elderly are often treated with several medications, which may have both beneficial and deleterious effects. The use and type of medication in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and association with falls is limited. We examined the association between falls and medication use in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Diagnosis, demographics, medication use, apolipoprotein E4 allele status and functional activity level at baseline were gathered for 810 participants enrolled in the ADNI, including healthy controls and subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's. Reports detailing adverse event falls were tabulated. Baseline characteristics were compared between subjects with and without one or more falls. Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to evaluate the association between subject characteristics and hazard of the first fall. Age (p &lt; 0.0001), Functional Activities Questionnaire (p = 0.035), Beers List (p = 0.0477) and medications for treating cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's (p = 0.0019) were associated with hazard of fall in the univariate model. In the final multivariate model, after adjusting for covariates, Alzheimer's medication use (p = 0.0005) was associated with hazard of fall. Medication was changed by the clinician after an adverse fall event in 9% of the falls. About 7% of the falls were reported as serious adverse events and 6% were reported to be severe. We found a significant association between the use of symptomatic medication treating cognitive symptoms in AD and hazard of fall after adjusting for age and Beers List medication use. Additional pharmacovigilance of the association between falls and Alzheimer's medication use is warranted. 
24388979	Targeting neurogenesis ameliorates danger assessment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Behav. Brain Res. 20131231 2014Mar15
Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 13% of the population over the age of 65. Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent and affect 80% of patients. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is impaired in AD, is involved in learning and memory. It remains unclear, however, whether increasing adult neurogenesis improves behavioral symptoms in AD. We report that in the 3xTgAD mouse model of AD, chronic Wnt3a overexpression in the ventral hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) restored adult neurogenesis to physiological levels. The restoration of adult neurogenesis led to full recovery of danger assessment impairment and the effect was blocked by ablation of neurogenesis with X-irradiation. Finally, using a bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) mRNA expression array, we found that the expression of the 5-HT1A receptor in 3xTgAD mice is selectively decreased and normalized by Wnt3a overexpression in the ventral hippocampus DG, and this normalization is neurogenesis dependent. These findings indicate that reestablishing a functional population of hippocampal newborn neurons in adult AD mice rescues behavioral symptoms, suggesting that adult neurogenesis may be a promising therapeutic target for alleviating behavioral deficits in AD patients.  
24189376	In vivo type 1 cannabinoid receptor availability in Alzheimer's disease.
Eur Neuropsychopharmacol 20131017 2014Feb
The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an important modulatory and potentially neuroprotective homeostatic system in the brain. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the role of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CBâ‚?R) is unclear, with contradictory findings in post-mortem studies showing upregulation, downregulation or unchanged CBâ‚?R status. We have investigated CBâ‚?R availability in vivo in patients with AD, in relation to amyloid deposition, cognitive functioning and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. Eleven AD patients and 7 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent combined [Â¹â?¸F]MK-9470 PET and [Â¹Â¹C]PIB PET scans to assess CBâ‚?R availability and amyloid deposition, respectively, and T1 volumetric MRI for partial volume correction. We found no difference in CBâ‚?R availability between AD and HV, VOI-based fractional uptake values (FUR) were 0.043Â±0.01 for AD and 0.045Â±0.01 for controls (p=0.9). CBâ‚?R availability did not correlate with neuropsychological test scores and was not modulated by ApoE genotype. As expected, global [Â¹Â¹C]PIB SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio) was increased in AD (SUVR 1.9Â±0.3) compared to HV (1.2Â±0.1) with p&lt;0.001, but no correlation was found between amyloid Î² (AÎ²) deposition and CBâ‚?R availability. In conclusion, we found no in vivo evidence for a difference in CBâ‚?R availability in AD compared to age-matched controls. Taken together with recently reported in vivo CBâ‚?R changes in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, these data suggest that the CBâ‚?R is differentially involved in neurodegenerative disorders. 
24001556	Biomarkers in pharmacology and drug discovery.
Biochem. Pharmacol. 20130831 2014Jan1
Biomarkers, quantitatively measurable indicators of biological or pathogenic processes, once validated play a critical role in disease diagnostics, the prediction of disease progression, and/or monitoring of the response to treatment. They may also represent drug targets. A number of different methods can be used for biomarker discovery and validation, including proteomics methods, metabolomics, imaging, and genome wide association studies (GWASs) and can be analysed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. The relative utility of single biomarkers compared to biomarker panels is discussed, along with paradigms for biomarker development, the latter in the context of three large-scale biomarker consortia, the Critical Path Predictive Safety Testing Consortium (PSTC), the NCI Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The importance of systematic optimization of many parameters in biomarker analysis, including validation, reproducibility, study design, statistical analysis and avoidance of bias are critical features used by these consortia. Problems including introduction of bias into study designs, data reporting or data analysis are also reviewed.  
24102330	A novel function for proSAAS as an amyloid anti-aggregant in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurochem. 20131024 2014Feb
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by an abnormal aggregation of misfolded beta-sheet rich proteins such as Î²-amyloid (AÎ²). Various ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperones control the correct folding of cellular proteins and prevent the accumulation of harmful species. We here describe a novel anti-aggregant chaperone function for the neuroendocrine protein proSAAS, an abundant secretory polypeptide that is widely expressed within neural and endocrine tissues and which has previously been associated with neurodegenerative disease in various proteomics studies. In the brains of 12-month-old APdE9 mice, and in the cortex of a human AD-affected brain, proSAAS immunoreactivity was highly colocalized with amyloid pathology. Immunoreactive proSAAS co-immunoprecipitated with AÎ² immunoreactivity in lysates from APdE9 mouse brains. In vitro, proSAAS efficiently prevented the fibrillation of AÎ²(1-42) at molar ratios of 1 : 10, and this anti-aggregation effect was dose dependent. Structure-function studies showed that residues 97-180 were sufficient for the anti-aggregation function against AÎ². Finally, inclusion of recombinant proSAAS in the medium of Neuro2a cells, as well as lentiviral-mediated proSAAS over-expression, blocked the neurocytotoxic effect of AÎ²(1-42) in Neuro2a cells. Taken together, our results suggest that proSAAS may play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathology. 
24382264	Changes in CNS cells in hyperammonemic portal hypertensive rats.
J. Neurochem. 20131024 2014Feb
Rats with pre-hepatic portal hypertension because of partial portal vein ligation develop minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) with hyperammonemia, impaired blood-brain barrier, mild brain edema, and severe mitochondrial changes in the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes of different neural cells in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. Animals were divided into two groups, MHE and sham. Astrocytes were studied by immunostaining with glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100Î² protein; neurons were immunostained with neuronal nuclear marker, microtubule associated protein-2, and NF-200 and capillaries with Nestin. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±) and its downstream proteins, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R), were also evaluated. Astrocytes were increased in area and number only in the hippocampus, while S100Î² increased in both brain areas in MHE animals. Microtubule associated protein-2 and NF-200 immunoreactivities (-ir) were significantly reduced in both areas. Hippocampal Nestin-ir was increased in MHE animals. These cellular changes were similar to those described in ischemic conditions, thus HIF-1Î±, P-gp, and Epo-R were also evaluated. A high expression of HIF-1Î± in cortical neurons was observed in the MHE group. It is likely that this hypoxia-like state is triggered via ammonia occupying the binding domain of HIF-1Î± and thereby preventing its degradation and inducing its stabilization, leading to the over-expression of P-gp and the Epo-R. 
24284078	Altered neurochemical metabolites in Alzheimer's disease patients with unawareness of deficits.
Int Psychogeriatr 20131128 2014Mar
Unawareness of deficits is common and is associated with poor outcomes in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, little is known about correlated neurobiochemical changes. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to examine neurobiochemical correlates of unawareness of deficits as assessed by the Dementia Deficit Scale in 36 patients with AD. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra were acquired from the anterior cingulate area and right orbitofrontal area. Concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), total creatine, and other neurometabolites were calculated. Nineteen (52.8%) participants had relative unawareness of deficits. This condition was negatively correlated with NAA/creatine in the anterior cingulate area (Î² = -0.36, p = 0.025) and positively correlated with NAA/creatine in the right orbitofrontal area (Î² = 0.41, p = 0.009) after controlling for dementia severity. These findings suggest unawareness of deficits in AD was associated with the altered neurochemical metabolites in the anterior cingulate area and right orbitofrontal area. However, the two areas might have opposite neuronal functions in unawareness of deficits. 
24284135	Acceptance of and attitudes towards Alzheimer's disease screening in elderly German adults.
Int Psychogeriatr 20131127 2014Mar
Considering the discussion on implementing routine dementia screening in Germany, the objective of the current study was to validate the German version of the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM-PC) questionnaire and to determine the acceptance of Alzheimer's disease screening in elderly German adults. The German version of the PRISM-PC was administered to a subsample of participants who attended the Berlin Aging Study II (n = 506). The questionnaire was validated by exploratory as well as confirmatory factor analysis. Regarding acceptance of Alzheimer's disease screening (Section B) a single factor structure fitted best. In terms of attitudes regarding Alzheimer's disease (Section D), a hierarchical factor structure was modeled with the higher-order factor "Harms" covering the domains "Family Burden," "Dependence," "Emotional Suffering," "Stigma," and "Medical Care" on the one hand and the domain "Future Planning" on the other hand. Internal consistency of the different scales reached from Î± = 0.67 to Î± = 0.94. Overall, 71.2% of the participants indicated that they wanted to be screened for Alzheimer's disease on a regular basis. This study suggests that acceptance can reliably be assessed with the section "Acceptance of Alzheimer's disease screenings" of the German PRISM-PC questionnaire. Furthermore, the majority of elderly German adults would like to be screened for Alzheimer's disease regularly, which might be an effective starting point in order to implement routine dementia screenings. As the sample is a convenience sample of (relatively) healthy older adults, generalizability of these results is limited. 
24284139	Utility of neuropsychiatric tools in the differential diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease: quantitative and qualitative findings.
Int Psychogeriatr 20131128 2014Mar
Discerning dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common and challenging differential diagnoses at the memory clinic. Although the neuropsychiatric manifestations have been widely reported as one of the main key points in the differential diagnosis between these two diseases, to date no neuropsychiatric questionnaire has been specifically devised for this purpose. We administered the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease (CUSPAD) to a memory clinic sample of 80 patients with probable DLB and 85 age- and severity-matched patients with probable AD. Diagnosis of probable DLB was supported with a positive dopamine transporter SPECT scan. We examined the usefulness of these two neuropsychiatric tools designed for AD in the differential diagnosis between DLB and AD. We also investigated the correlations between psychotic symptoms and measures of cognitive and functional decline. Auditory hallucinations were very specific of DLB and were usually preceded by visual hallucinations. Misinterpretation of real visual stimuli (illusions) was more frequent in DLB. Delusions were both quantitatively and qualitatively different between DLB and AD: delusional misidentifications were significantly more characteristic of DLB, while paranoid delusions did not show specificity for DLB. Neuropsychiatric tools are useful to discriminate DLB from AD. Hallucinations and delusions are not only more frequent in DLB than in AD but also have distinct qualitative characteristics and patterns of progression that can help clinicians to make a more accurate differential diagnosis. 
24343096	Characterization of metal profiles in serum during the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
Metallomics  2014Feb
Metal dyshomeostasis is closely related to Alzheimer's disease, so the characterization of the metal profiles in these patients is of special interest for studying associated neurodegenerative processes and to discover potential markers of disease. An analytical approach, based on non-denaturing precipitation of proteins, has been optimized for the fractionation of high molecular mass (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM) metal-species from serum, which were subjected to multielemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This methodology was applied to healthy controls, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients in order to study the progression of dementia. Thus, it was found that some metals, such as iron, copper, zinc and aluminium, suffer progressive changes along the advance of neurodegeneration, suggesting that these imbalances could be related to the decline of cognitive functions. On the other hand, elements such as manganese, lithium or vanadium allow discriminating between controls and diseased subjects, both AD and MCI, but no differences were found between these two clinical stages, so they could be considered as precursors in the early development of neurodegenerative failures. In addition, it should be noted the important role that low molecular mass fractions of iron, copper, aluminium and cobalt appear to play in pathogenesis of Alzheimer. Finally, correlation analysis indicated that these metal abnormalities can be interrelated, participating in common processes such as oxidative stress, altered homeostasis and uptake into brain, as well as impaired glucose metabolism.  
24353014	Clusterin in Alzheimer's disease: a player in the biological behavior of amyloid-beta.
Neurosci Bull 20131219 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major killer, and although its pathogenesis varies, one dominant feature is an increase in the expression, formation, and sedimentation of senile plaques of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) peptides in the brain. The chaperone protein clusterin has, since its first discovery at the end of the 20(th) century, been labeled as a cytoprotector. However, epigenetic studies showing that clusterin is associated with the severity and risk of AD, especially in the hippocampus, triggered studies to clarify its role in the pathogenesis of AD. It is true that clusterin can inhibit the aggregation of AÎ² and therefore prevent further formation of senile plaques in the AD brain, yet it induces the formation of soluble forms of AÎ² which are toxic to neurons. Another problematic finding is that clusterin is involved in a pathway through which AÎ² has neurodegenerative effects intracellularly. Although the role of clusterin in the pathogenesis of AD is still not clear, this review specifically discusses the interactions between clusterin and AÎ², to open up the possibility of a potential therapeutic approach for treating AD.  
24269515	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of imine resveratrol derivatives as multi-targeted agents against Alzheimer's disease.
Eur J Med Chem 20131104 2014Jan
A series of imine resveratrol derivatives (1-20) have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multi-targeted compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro studies show that most of the molecules exhibit a significant ability to inhibit self-induced and Cu(2+)-induced Î²-amyloid (AÎ²â‚?â‚‹â‚„â‚‚) aggregation, and to function as potential antioxidants and biometal chelators. In particular, compound 9 is a potential lead compound for AD treatment (for compound 9, ICâ‚…â‚€ = 14.1 Î¼M for the antioxidant activity using DPPH free radical method; 64.6% at 20 Î¼M for self-induced AÎ² aggregation). Moreover, it is capable of decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by Cu-AÎ² and shows good neuroprotective effects in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Taken together, these results suggest that 9 might be a promising lead compound for AD treatment. 
24550828	Network-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: review and future directions.
Front Aging Neurosci 20140204 2014
By 2050 it is estimated that the number of worldwide Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients will quadruple from the current number of 36 million people. To date, no single test, prior to postmortem examination, can confirm that a person suffers from AD. Therefore, there is a strong need for accurate and sensitive tools for the early diagnoses of AD. The complex etiology and multiple pathogenesis of AD call for a system-level understanding of the currently available biomarkers and the study of new biomarkers via network-based modeling of heterogeneous data types. In this review, we summarize recent research on the study of AD as a connectivity syndrome. We argue that a network-based approach in biomarker discovery will provide key insights to fully understand the network degeneration hypothesis (disease starts in specific network areas and progressively spreads to connected areas of the initial loci-networks) with a potential impact for early diagnosis and disease-modifying treatments. We introduce a new framework for the quantitative study of biomarkers that can help shorten the transition between academic research and clinical diagnosis in AD.  
24605123	Improvement of Screening Accuracy of Mini-Mental State Examination for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Non-Alzheimer's Disease Dementia by Supplementation of Verbal Fluency Performance.
Psychiatry Investig 20140121 2014Jan
THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE SUPPLEMENTATION OF VERBAL FLUENCY: Animal category test (VF) performance can improve the screening ability of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and their major subtypes. Six hundred fifty-five cognitively normal (CN), 366 MCI [282 amnestic MCI (aMCI); 84 non-amnestic MCI (naMCI)] and 494 dementia [346 Alzheimer's disease (AD); and 148 non-Alzheimer's disease dementia (NAD)] individuals living in the community were included (all aged 50 years and older) in the study. The VF-supplemented MMSE (MMSE+VF) score had a significantly better screening ability for MCI, dementia and overall cognitive impairment (MCI plus dementia) than the MMSE raw score alone. MMSE+VF showed a significantly better ability than MMSE for both MCI subtypes, i.e., aMCI and naMCI. In the case of dementia subtypes, MMSE+VF was better than the MMSE alone for NAD screening, but not for AD screening. The results support the usefulness of VF-supplementation to improve the screening performance of MMSE for MCI and NAD. 
24032632	Nucleic acid oxidation: an early feature of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurochem. 20131021 2014Jan
Studies of oxidative damage during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest its central role in disease pathogenesis. To investigate levels of nucleic acid oxidation in both early and late stages of AD, levels of multiple base adducts were quantified in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from the superior and middle temporal gyri (SMTG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and cerebellum (CER) of age-matched normal control subjects, subjects with mild cognitive impairment, preclinical AD, late-stage AD, and non-AD neurological disorders (diseased control; DC) using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Median levels of multiple DNA adducts in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA were significantly (p â‰¤ 0.05) elevated in the SMTG, IPL, and CER in multiple stages of AD and in DC subjects. Elevated levels of fapyguanine and fapyadenine in mitochondrial DNA suggest a hypoxic environment early in the progression of AD and in DC subjects. Overall, these data suggest that oxidative damage is an early event not only in the pathogenesis of AD but is also present in neurodegenerative diseases in general. Levels of oxidized nucleic acids in nDNA and mtDNA were found to be significantly elevated in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), preclinical Alzheimer's disease (PCAD), late-stage AD (LAD), and a pooled diseased control group (DC) of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) subjects compared to normal control (NC) subjects. Nucleic acid oxidation peaked early in disease progression and remained elevated. The study suggests nucleic acid oxidation is a general event in neurodegeneration. 
24176981	Effect of amyloid on memory and non-memory decline from preclinical to clinical Alzheimer's disease.
Brain 20131030 2014Jan
High amyloid has been associated with substantial episodic memory decline over 18 and 36 months in healthy older adults and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. However, the nature and magnitude of amyloid-related memory and non-memory change from the preclinical to the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease has not been evaluated over the same time interval. Healthy older adults (n = 320), individuals with mild cognitive impairment (n = 57) and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (n = 36) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study underwent at least one positron emission tomography neuroimaging scan for amyloid. Cognitive assessments were conducted at baseline, and 18- and 36-month follow-up assessments. Compared with amyloid-negative healthy older adults, amyloid-positive healthy older adults, and amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease showed moderate and equivalent decline in verbal and visual episodic memory over 36 months (d's = 0.47-0.51). Relative to amyloid-negative healthy older adults, amyloid-positive healthy older adults showed no decline in non-memory functions, but amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment showed additional moderate decline in language, attention and visuospatial function (d's = 0.47-1.12), and amyloid-positive individuals with Alzheimer's disease showed large decline in all aspects of memory and non-memory function (d's = 0.73-2.28). Amyloid negative individuals with mild cognitive impairment did not show any cognitive decline over 36 months. When non-demented individuals (i.e. healthy older adults and adults with mild cognitive impairment) were further dichotomized, high amyloid-positive non-demented individuals showed a greater rate of decline in episodic memory and language when compared with low amyloid positive non-demented individuals. Memory decline does not plateau with increasing disease severity, and decline in non-memory functions increases in amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The combined detection of amyloid positivity and objectively-defined decline in memory are reliable indicators of early Alzheimer's disease, and the detection of decline in non-memory functions in amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment may assist in determining the level of disease severity in these individuals. Further, these results suggest that grouping amyloid data into at least two categories of abnormality may be useful in determining the disease risk level in non-demented individuals.  
24277722	Fractalkine activates NRF2/NFE2L2 and heme oxygenase 1 to restrain tauopathy-induced microgliosis.
Brain 20131125 2014Jan
The chemokine fractalkine modulates microglial responses in neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies, but the mechanistic processes and their relevance in human brain pathologies is not yet known. Here, we show that hippocampal HT22 cells expressing human TAU(P301L) mutant protein produce fractalkine, which in microglia activates AKT, inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² and upregulates the transcription factor NRF2/NFE2L2 and its target genes including heme oxygenase 1. In a mouse model of tauopathy based on stereotaxic delivery in hippocampus of an adeno-associated viral vector for expression of TAU(P301L), we confirmed that tau-injured neurons express fractalkine. NRF2- and fractalkine receptor-knockout mice did not express heme oxygenase 1 in microglia and exhibited increased microgliosis and astrogliosis in response to neuronal TAU(P301L) expression, demonstrating a crucial role of the fractalkine/NRF2/heme oxygenase 1 pathway in attenuation of the pro-inflammatory phenotype. The hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease also exhibits increased expression of fractalkine in TAU-injured neurons that recruit microglia. These events correlated with increased levels of NRF2 and heme oxygenase 1 proteins, suggesting an attempt of the diseased brain to limit microgliosis. Our combined results indicate that fractalkine mobilizes NRF2 to limit over-activation of microglia and identify this new target to control unremitting neuroinflammation in tauopathies.  
24271788	Soluble pathological tau in the entorhinal cortex leads to presynaptic deficits in an early Alzheimer's disease model.
Acta Neuropathol. 20131124 2014Feb
Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, are intracellular silver and thioflavin S-staining aggregates that emerge from earlier accumulation of phospho-tau in the soma. Whether soluble misfolded but nonfibrillar tau disrupts neuronal function is unclear. Here we investigate if soluble pathological tau, specifically directed to the entorhinal cortex (EC), can cause behavioral or synaptic deficits. We studied rTgTauEC transgenic mice, in which P301L mutant human tau overexpressed primarily in the EC leads to the development of tau pathology, but only rare NFT at 16Â months of age. We show that the early tau lesions are associated with nearly normal performance in contextual fear conditioning, a hippocampal-related behavior task, but more robust changes in neuronal system activation as marked by Arc induction and clear electrophysiological defects in perforant pathway synaptic plasticity. Electrophysiological changes were likely due to a presynaptic deficit and changes in probability of neurotransmitter release. The data presented here support the hypothesis that misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau can impair neuronal function within the entorhinal-hippocampal network, even prior to frank NFT formation and overt neurodegeneration.  
24150103	Clinical profile of Alzheimer's disease: is the age of the patient a decisive factor? results of the INFLUENCE study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that dementia patients aged â‰¥ 85 years are biologically different from those aged 65-84. This study aimed to assess whether patients (&gt;85 years) have a distinct sociodemographic and clinical profile. Older patients had lower educational achievements, different carer relationships, and were more likely to take memantine/concomitant treatments and be institutionalized. Differences were observed with respect to concomitant disease/other risk factors (depression, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension). Oldest patients had greater impairment (more severe Global Deterioration Scale stage, lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores). Greater concomitant drug use and younger carers associated with older patients suggest higher management and social costs.  
24157723	MicroRNAs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid as potential markers for Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
The development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers remains an unmet challenge, and new approaches that can improve current AD biomarker strategies are needed. Recent reports suggested that microRNA (miRNA) profiling of biological fluids has emerged as a diagnostic tool for several pathologic conditions. In this study, we measured six candidate miRNAs (miR-9, miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-125b, and miR-146a) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD and normal subjects by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to evaluate their potential usability as AD biomarkers. The qRT-PCR results showed that plasma miR-34a and miR-146a levels, and CSF miR-34a, miR-125b, and miR-146a levels in AD patients were significantly lower than in control subjects. On the other hand, CSF miR-29a and miR-29b levels were significantly higher than in control subjects. Our results provide a possibility that miRNAs detected in plasma and CSF can serve as biomarkers for AD.  
24157724	The benefits of errorless learning for serial reaction time performance in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Identifying the conditions favoring new procedural skill learning in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could be important for patients' autonomy. It has been suggested that error elimination is beneficial during skill learning, but no study has explored the advantage of this method in sequential learning situations. In this study, we examined the acquisition of a 6-element perceptual-motor sequence by AD patients and healthy older adults (control group). We compared the impact of two preliminary sequence learning conditions (Errorless versus Errorful) on Serial Reaction Time performance at two different points in the learning process. A significant difference in reaction times for the learned sequence and a new sequence was observed in both conditions in healthy older participants; in AD patients, the difference was significant only in the errorless condition. The learning effect was greater in the errorless than the errorful condition in both groups. However, while the errorless advantage was found at two different times in the learning process in the AD group, in the control group this advantage was observed only at the halfway point. These results support the hypothesis that errorless learning allows for faster automation of a procedure than errorful learning in both AD and healthy older subjects.  
24164734	Acute aerobic exercise increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in elderly with Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Studies indicate the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Decreased BDNF levels may constitute a lack of trophic support and contribute to cognitive impairment in AD. The benefits of acute and chronic physical exercise on BDNF levels are well-documented in humans, however, exercise effects on BDNF levels have not been analyzed in older adults with AD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute aerobic exercise on BDNF levels in older adults with AD and to verify associations among BDNF levels, aerobic fitness, and level of physical activity. Using a controlled design, twenty-one patients with AD (76.3 Â± 6.2 years) and eighteen healthy older adults (74.6 Â± 4.7 years) completed an acute aerobic exercise. The outcomes included measures of BDNF plasma levels, aerobic fitness (treadmill grade, time to exhaustion, VO2, and maximal lactate) and level of physical activity (Baecke Questionnaire Modified for the Elderly). The independent t-test shows differences between groups with respect to the BDNF plasma levels at baseline (p = 0.04; t = 4.53; df = 37). In two-way ANOVA, a significant effect of time was found (p = 0.001; F = 13.63; df = 37), the aerobic exercise significantly increased BDNF plasma levels in AD patients and healthy controls. A significant correlation (p = 0.04; r = 0.33) was found between BDNF levels and the level of physical activity. The results of our study suggest that aerobic exercise increases BDNF plasma levels in patients with AD and healthy controls. In addition to that, BDNF levels had association with level of physical activity.  
24164736	Glutaminyl cyclase in human cortex: correlation with (pGlu)-amyloid-Î² load and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are characterized in part by the formation of high molecular weight aggregates of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides, which interfere with neuronal function and provoke neuronal cell death. The pyroglutamate (pGlu) modification of AÎ² was demonstrated to be catalyzed by the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) and to enhance pathogenicity and neurotoxicity. Here, we addressed the role of QC in AD pathogenesis in human cortex. Two sets of human postmortem brain tissue from a total of 13 non-demented controls and 11 AD cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and unbiased stereology, quantitative RT-PCR, and enzymatic activity assays for the expression level of QC in temporal and entorhinal cortex. Additionally, cortical AÎ² and pGlu-AÎ² concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Data on QC expression and AÎ² peptide concentrations were correlated with each other and with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of individual cases. In control cases, QC expression was higher in the more vulnerable entorhinal cortex than in temporal cortex. In AD brains, QC mRNA expression and the immunoreactivity of QC were increased in both cortical regions and frequently associated with pGlu-AÎ² deposits. The analyses of individual cases revealed significant correlations between QC mRNA levels and the concentration of insoluble pGlu-AÎ² aggregates, but not of unmodified AÎ² peptides. Elevated pGlu-AÎ² load showed a better correlation with the decline in MMSE than elevated concentration of unmodified AÎ². Our observations provide evidence for an involvement of QC in AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline by QC-catalyzed pGlu-AÎ² formation.  
24169237	Transthyretin stabilization by iododiflunisal promotes amyloid-Î² peptide clearance, decreases its deposition, and ameliorates cognitive deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and now represents 50-70% of total dementia cases. Over the last two decades, transthyretin (TTR) has been associated with AD and, very recently, a novel concept of TTR stability has been established in vitro as a key factor in TTR/amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) interaction. Small compounds, TTR stabilizers (usually non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs), bind to the thyroxine (T4) central binding channel, increasing TTR tetrameric stability and TTR/AÎ² interaction. In this work, we evaluated in vivo the effects of one of the TTR stabilizers identified as improving TTR/AÎ² interaction, iododiflunisal (IDIF), in AÎ² deposition and other AD features, using AÎ²PPswe/PS1A246E transgenic mice, either carrying two or just one copy of the TTR gene (AD/TTR+/+ or AD/TTR+/-, respectively), available and characterized in our laboratory. The results showed that IDIF administered orally bound TTR in plasma and stabilized the protein, as assessed by T4 displacement assays, and was able to enter the brain as revealed by mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. TTR levels, both in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, were not altered. In AD/TTR+/- mice, IDIF administration resulted not only in decreased brain AÎ² levels and deposition but also in improved cognitive function associated with the AD-like neuropathology in this mouse model, although no improvements were detectable in the AD/TTR+/+ animals. Further, in AD/TTR+/- mice, AÎ² levels were reduced in plasma suggesting TTR promoted AÎ² clearance from the brain and from the periphery. Taken together, these results strengthen the importance of TTR stability in the design of therapeutic drugs, highlighting the capacity of IDIF to be used in AD treatment to prevent and to slow the progression of the disease.  
24169238	White matter hyperintensities are positively associated with cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
White matter hyperintensities are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). White matter hyperintensities are believed to disconnect brain areas. We examined the topographical association between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness in controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients. We examined associations between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness among 18 older cognitively healthy participants, 18 amnestic MCI, and 17 mild AD patients. These associations were cluster-size corrected for multiple comparisons. In controls, a positive association between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness was found in lateral temporal gyri. In MCI patients, white matter hyperintensities were positively related to cortical thickness in frontal, temporal, and parietal areas. Positive associations between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness in AD patients were confined to parietal areas. The results of the interaction group by white matter hyperintensities on cortical thickness were consistent with the findings of positive associations in the parietal lobe for MCI and AD patients separately. In the frontal areas, controls and AD patients showed inverse associations between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness, while MCI patients still showed a positive association. These results suggest that a paradoxical relationship between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness could be a consequence of neuroinflammatory processes induced by AD-pathology and white matter hyperintensities. Alternatively, it might reflect a region-specific and disease-stage dependent compensatory hypertrophy in response to a compromised network.  
24217272	Reduced levels of mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFB8 and linked complex I + III oxidoreductase activity in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Bioenergetic failure is a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined mitochondrial function in the amyloid-Î² protein precursor transgenic 'TgCRND8' mouse model of AD. Activities of NADH: cytochrome c reductase (complex I + III) and cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) of the electron transport chain, as well as those of Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (Î±-KGDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were assessed in brains of 45 week-old mice. Complex I + III activity was reduced by almost 50%, whereas complex IV, Î±-KGDH, and PDH activities were unaffected. Reduced activity coincided with decreased expression of NDUFB8, a nuclear-DNA encoded subunit integral to the assembly of complex I. The composition and availability of cardiolipin, a major phospholipid in inner mitochondrial membranes, was not altered. To determine whether mitochondrial output is affected by the selective reduction in complex I + III activity, we examined tissue levels of high-energy phosphates. ATP was maintained whereas creatine increased in the cortex and hippocampus. These results suggest disruption of complex I function and the likely role of creatine in sustaining ATP at late stages of dysfunction in TgCRND8 mice.  
24435851	Predictive association of copper metabolism proteins with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: a preliminary perspective.
Biometals 20140117 2014Feb
Neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), constitute a major worldwide health problem. Several hypothesis have been put forth to elucidate the basis of onset and pathogenesis of AD and PD; however, till date, none of these seems to clearly elucidate the complex pathoetiology of these disorders. Notably, copper dyshomeostasis has been shown to underlie the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases including AD and PD. Numerous studies have concluded beyond doubt that imbalance in copper homeostatic mechanisms in conjunction with aging causes an acceleration in the copper toxicity elicited oxidative stress, which is detrimental to the central nervous system. Amyloid precursor protein and Î±-synuclein protein involved in AD and PD are copper binding proteins, respectively. In this review, we have discussed the possible association of copper metabolism proteins with AD and PD along with briefly outlining the expanding proportion of "copper interactome" in human biology. Using network biology, we found that copper metabolism proteins, superoxide dismutase 1 and ceruloplasmin may represent direct and indirect link with AD and PD, respectively.  
24473557	The thickness of posterior cortical areas is related to executive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
Clinics (Sao Paulo)  2014Jan
To establish whether alterations of brain structures in Alzheimer's disease are associated with executive dysfunction. Nineteen patients with Alzheimer's disease and 22 older control subjects underwent a comprehensive evaluation. The clock drawing test, digit span test, executive motor function test, Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome battery (Rule Shift Cards test), and Stroop test were used to evaluate executive dysfunction. A multiparametric approach using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite provided a description of volumetric and geometric features of the gray matter structures. The cortical thickness maps showed a negative correlation between the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome battery (Rule Shift Cards test) and the right middle frontal gyrus; a positive correlation between the executive motor function test and the left superior parietal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, bilateral supramarginal gyri, right middle frontal gyrus, and right precuneus; a negative correlation between the Stroop test (part III) and the right superior parietal gyrus; and a negative correlation between the Stroop test (part III) and the right middle temporal gyrus. Executive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease is correlated with alterations not only in the frontal areas but also within many temporal and parietal regions. 
24471710	Can stress increase Alzheimer's disease risk in women?
Expert Rev Neurother  2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of Î²-amyloid peptides and neurofibrilllary tangles in brain, resulting in neuronal death and loss of cognitive abilities. It has been hypothesized that longstanding psychological stress can result in neural degeneration and AD due to pathological alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In recent years several epidemiological studies been published on stress as a risk factor for AD. As women are more likely to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and clinical burnout syndrome, special effort has been made according to the gender differences in risk of AD. However, few studies have stratified for gender, due to small sample sizes and limited statistic power, and no reliable findings have been found. Additional longitudinal studies are therefore needed for studying gender differences and for determining what mediates the stress and AD association, in both genders.  
23934553	Up-regulation of Alzheimer's disease-associated proteins may cause enflurane anesthesia induced cognitive decline in aged rats.
Neurol. Sci. 20130811 2014Feb
Isoflurane anesthesia can cause post-operative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. As an isomer of isoflurane, enflurane may also account for cognitive dysfunction. However, the mechanism of enflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the effects of enflurane anesthesia on cognitive function and the possible roles of Î²-amyloid protein and phosphorylated tau protein in response to enflurane anesthesia in aged rats. After intraperitoneal injection of enflurane, the Morris water maze and the step-down passive avoidance tests were conducted to test the cognitive ability and memory. The enflurane group showed prolonged escape latency, extended space exploration time and increased number of errors at early stage after enflurane anesthesia, suggesting that enflurane should be responsible for the impairment of cognition in aged rats. In addition, we analyzed the expression level of Î²-amyloid and phosphorylation level of tau in the hippocampus by immunoblotting. Interestingly, the levels of Î²-amyloid and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus increased significantly at early stage and then restored to pre-anesthetic levels. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing of Î²-amyloid and phosphorylation of tau are important to cause cognitive decline in aged rats during initial stage after enflurane anesthesia.  
24511859	Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease: update for the primary care clinician.
J Ark Med Soc  2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects approximately 5.3 million Americans. Recently, new diagnostic criteria advanced by the National Institute of Aging have significantly improved our understanding of the AD continuum across several stages and is more scientifically based compared to the previously formulated criteria in 1984. Use by primary care physicians of these new clinical criteria coupled with the understanding of the role of biomarkers will help you to make accurate diagnoses earlier in the disease process when intervention can be most beneficial. 
23927914	Genetics of dementia.
Lancet 20130806 2014Mar1
25% of all people aged 55 years and older have a family history of dementia. For most, the family history is due to genetically complex disease, where many genetic variations of small effect interact to increase risk of dementia. The lifetime risk of dementia for these families is about 20%, compared with 10% in the general population. A small proportion of families have an autosomal dominant family history of early-onset dementia, which is often due to mendelian disease, caused by a mutation in one of the dementia genes. Each family member has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, which confers a lifetime dementia risk of over 95%. In this Review, we focus on the evidence for, and the approach to, genetic testing in Alzheimer's disease (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes), frontotemporal dementia (MAPT, GRN, C9ORF72, and other genes), and other familial dementias. We conclude by discussing the practical aspects of genetic counselling. 
24596678	LRP-1 polymorphism is associated with global and regional amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease in humans in-vivo.
Neuroimage Clin 20140205 2014
Impaired amyloid clearance has been proposed to contribute to Î²-amyloid deposition in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) is involved in the active outward transport of Î²-amyloid across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The C667T polymorphism (rs1799986) of the LRP-1 gene has been inconsistently associated with AD in genetic studies. We aimed to elucidate the association of this polymorphism with in-vivo brain amyloid load of AD patients using amyloid PET with [(11)C]PiB. 72 patients with very mild to moderate AD were examined with amyloid PET and C667T polymorphism was obtained using TaqMan PCR assays. The association of C667T polymorphism with global and regional amyloid load was calculated using linear regression and voxel based analysis, respectively. The effect of the previously identified modulator of amyloid uptake, the apolipoprotein E genotype, on this association was also determined. The regression analysis between amyloid load and C667T polymorphism was statistically significant (pÂ =Â 0.046, Î²Â =Â 0.236). In an additional analysis ApoE genotype and gender were identified to explain further variability of amyloid load. Voxel based analysis revealed a significant (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05) association between C667T polymorphism and amyloid uptake in the temporo-parietal cortex bilaterally. ApoE did not interact significantly with the LRP-1 polymorphism. In conclusion, C667T polymorphism of LRP-1 is moderately but significantly associated with global and regional amyloid deposition in AD. The relationship appears to be independent of the ApoE genotype. This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that impaired amyloid clearance contributes to amyloid deposition in late-onset sporadic AD. 
24600224	Neural basis of three dimensions of agitated behaviors in patients with Alzheimer disease.
Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat 20140217 2014
Agitated behaviors are frequently observed in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). The neural substrate underlying the agitated behaviors in dementia is unclear. We hypothesized that different dimensions of agitated behaviors are mediated by distinct neural systems. All the patients (n=32) underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Using the Agitated Behavior in Dementia scale, we identified the relationships between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns and the presence of each of three dimensions of agitated behavior (physically agitated behavior, verbally agitated behavior, and psychosis symptoms) in AD patients. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software was used to explore these neural correlations. Physically agitated behavior was significantly correlated with lower rCBF values in the right superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann 22) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 47). Verbally agitated behavior was significantly associated with lower rCBF values in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 46, 44) and the left insula (Brodmann 13). The psychosis symptoms were significantly correlated with lower rCBF values in the right angular gyrus (Brodmann 39) and the right occipital lobe (Brodmann 19). Our results support the hypothesis that three different agitated behaviors may represent distinct neural networks in AD patients. 
24316432	A tetra(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline ameliorates dendritic spine density and cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Exp. Neurol. 20131206 2014Feb
We recently reported that the tetra(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline, BTA-EG4, acts as an amyloid-binding small molecule that promotes dendritic spine density and cognitive function in wild-type mice. This raised the possibility that BTA-EG4 may benefit the functional decline seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we directly tested whether BTA-EG4 improves dendritic spine density and cognitive function in a well-established mouse model of AD carrying mutations in APP, PS1 and tau (APPswe;PS1M146V;tauP301L, 3xTg AD mice). We found that daily injections of BTA-EG4 for 2 weeks improved dendritic spine density and cognitive function of 3xTg AD mice in an age-dependent manner. Specifically, BTA-EG4 promoted both dendritic spine density and morphology alterations in cortical layers II/III and in the hippocampus at 6-10 months of age compared to vehicle-injected mice. However, at 13-16 months of age, only cortical spine density was improved without changes in spine morphology. The changes in dendritic spine density correlated with Ras activity, such that 6-10 month old BTA-EG4 injected 3xTg AD mice had increased Ras activity in the cortex and hippocampus, while 13-16 month old mice only trended toward an increase in Ras activity in the cortex. Finally, BTA-EG4 injected 3xTg AD mice at 6-10 months of age showed improved learning and memory; however, only minimal improvement was observed at 13-16 months of age. This behavioral improvement corresponds to a decrease in soluble AÎ² 40 levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that BTA-EG4 may be beneficial in ameliorating the synaptic loss seen in early AD. 
24162039	Impact of cerebro-spinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice: a multicentric study.
J. Neurol. 20131027 2014Jan
CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease are well validated in clinical research; however, their pragmatic utility in daily practice is still unappreciated. These biomarkers are used in routine practice according to Health Authority Recommendations. In 604 consecutive patients explored for cognitive disorders, questionnaires were prospectively proposed and filled. Before and after CSF biomarker results, clinicians provided a diagnosis and an estimate of their diagnostic confidence. Analysis has compared the frequency of diagnosis before and after CSF biomarker results using the net reclassification improvement (NRI) method. We have evaluated external validity comparing with data of French Bank National of AD (BNA). A total of 561 patients [Alzheimer's disease (AD), n = 253; non-AD, n = 308] were included (mean age, 68.6 years; women, 52 %). Clinically suspected diagnosis and CSF results were concordant in 65.2 % of cases. When clinical hypothesis and biological results were discordant, a reclassification occurred in favour of CSF biomarkers results in 76.9 %. The NRI was 39.5 %. In addition, the results show a statistically significant improvement in clinician confidence for their diagnosis. In comparison with BNA data, patients were younger and more frequently diagnosed with AD. Clinicians tend to heavily rely on the CSF AD biomarkers results and are more confident in their diagnoses using CSF AD biomarkers. Thus, these biomarkers appear as a key tool in clinical practice. 
24036895	Low platelet iPLAâ‚‚ activity predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease: a 4-year follow-up study.
J Neural Transm 20130915 2014Feb
Reduced phospholipase Aâ‚‚ (PLAâ‚‚) activity has been reported in the brain and in blood cells of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk of developing AD. In the present study, we determined the activity of distinct PLAâ‚‚ subgroups (iPLAâ‚‚, sPLAâ‚‚ and cPLAâ‚‚) in older adults with MCI as compared to patients with mild dementia due to AD and to cognitively healthy controls. We investigated whether decreased PLAâ‚‚ activity at baseline is associated with the progression of MCI to AD upon follow-up during a period of 4 years. The activity of PLAâ‚‚ subgroups was determined in platelets from 169 elderly adults. Progression of MCI to AD was ascertained by standard clinical criteria for AD upon follow-up. At baseline, iPLAâ‚‚ activity was significantly decreased (p = 0.001) in patients with AD and MCI as compared to controls. Patients with MCI who progressed to AD during follow-up showed significantly lower iPLAâ‚‚ activity at baseline as compared to patients with MCI who did not progress to AD (p = 0.009). Moreover, subjects from the control group at baseline who progressed to MCI during follow-up had lower sPLAâ‚‚ and cPLAâ‚‚ (p = 0.014 and p = 0.009, respectively). Our findings suggest that low platelet iPLAâ‚‚ activity may be a risk marker for AD in subjects with MCI. Moreover, low sPLAâ‚‚ and cPLAâ‚‚ were related to cognitive decline in healthy controls, suggesting a relationship with the very early stages of the disease. 
24061483	NRG3 gene is associated with the risk and age at onset of Alzheimer disease.
J Neural Transm 20130924 2014Feb
The Neuregulin 3 (NRG3) gene at 10q22-q24 has been implicated in multiple psychiatric traits such as cognitive impairment. We therefore hypothesized that NRG3 gene polymorphisms may play a role in Alzheimer disease (AD). This present study explored the association of NRG3 with the age at onset (AAO) of AD and the risk of developing AD. Secondary data analysis of 257 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NRG3 gene was performed in 806 Alzheimer's disease patients and 782 controls using logistic regression and linear regression analyses. Eight SNPs were associated with the risk of AD (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05), while linear regression analysis showed 33 SNPs associated with the AAO of AD (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Two-SNP haplotype analyses based on UNPHASED revealed that the G-C haplotype from rs17685233 and rs17101017 was significantly associated with AD (pÂ =Â 0.0031) and the A-G haplotype from rs504522 and rs474018 as well as the A-G haplotype from rs504522 and rs2483295 were more significantly associated with the AAO of AD (pÂ =Â 6.72Â Ã—Â 10(-5)). Using an independent family-based sample, we found one SNP rs11192423 associated with AAO both in the case-control sample (pÂ =Â 0.0155) and in the family sample (pÂ =Â 0.0166). In addition, we observed nominally significant associations with AD and AAO for several flanking SNPs (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). This is the first study demonstrating that genetic variants in the NRG3 gene play a role in AD. Our results also revealed that SNPs in the NRG3 genes were more strongly associated with AAO of AD.  
24316056	Distinct communication patterns during genetic counseling for late-onset Alzheimer's risk assessment.
Patient Educ Couns 20131105 2014Feb
To identify and characterize patient-provider communication patterns during disclosure of Alzheimer's disease genetic susceptibility test results and to assess whether these patterns reflect differing models of genetic counseling. 262 genetic counseling session audio-recordings were coded using the Roter Interactional Analysis System. Cluster analysis was used to distinguish communication patterns. Bivariate analyses were used to identify characteristics associated with the patterns. Three patterns were identified: Biomedical-Provider-Teaching (40%), Biomedical-Patient-Driven (34.4%), and Psychosocial-Patient-Centered (26%). Psychosocial-Patient-Centered and Biomedical-Provider-Teaching sessions included more female participants while the Biomedical-Patient-Driven sessions included more male participants (p=0.04). Communication patterns observed reflected the teaching model primarily, with genetic counseling models less frequently used. The emphasis on biomedical communication may potentially be at the expense of more patient-centered approaches. To deliver more patient-centered care, providers may need to better balance the ratio of verbal exchange with their patients, as well as their educational and psychosocial discussions. The delineation of these patterns provides insights into the genetic counseling process that can be used to improve the delivery of genetic counseling care. These results can also be used in future research designed to study the association between patient-centered genetic counseling communication and improved patient outcomes. 
24044981	Allopregnanolone as regenerative therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease: translational development and clinical promise.
Prog. Neurobiol. 20130914 2014Feb
Herein, we review a translational development plan to advance allopregnanolone to the clinic as a regenerative therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's. Allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid that declines with age and neurodegenerative disease, was exogenously administered and assessed for safety and efficacy to promote neuro-regeneration, cognitive function and reduction of Alzheimer's pathology. Allopregnanolone-induced neurogenesis correlated with restoration of learning and memory function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and was comparably efficacious in aged normal mice. Critical to success was a dosing and treatment regimen that was consistent with the temporal requirements of systems biology of regeneration in brain. A treatment regimen that adhered to regenerative requirements of brain was also efficacious in reducing Alzheimer's pathology. With an optimized dosing and treatment regimen, chronic allopregnanolone administration promoted neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, reduced neuroinflammation and beta-amyloid burden while increasing markers of white matter generation and cholesterol homeostasis. Allopregnanolone meets three of the four drug-like physicochemical properties described by Lipinski's rule that predict the success rate of drugs in development for clinical trials. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes, securing GMP material, development of clinically translatable formulations and acquiring regulatory approval are discussed. Investigation of allopregnanolone as a regenerative therapeutic has provided key insights into mechanistic targets for neurogenesis and disease modification, dosing requirements, optimal treatment regimen, route of administration and the appropriate formulation necessary to advance to proof of concept clinical studies to determine efficacy of allopregnanolone as a regenerative and disease modifying therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.  
24315805	[Premature immunosenescence in triple-transgenic mice for Alzheimer's disease].
Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol 20131207 2014 Jan-Feb
A deterioration of the neuroimmunoendocrine network has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the peripheral immune response has hardly been investigated in this pathology. Since some immune function parameters have been established as good markers of the rate of ageing, and can predict longevity, the aim of the present work was to study some of these functions in splenic leucocytes in transgenic mice for AD of different ages. Young female (4 Â± 1 months), adult (9 Â± 1 months), and mature (12 Â± 1 months) triple-transgenic mice for AD (3 xTgAD) and non-transgenic (NTg) control mice of the same ages were used. The chemotaxis, the anti-tumour activity of Â« natural killer Â» (NK) cells and the lymphoproliferative response in the presence of the mitogens concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide, functions that decrease with age, were determined in splenic leucocytes. In addition, the differences in lifespan between 3 xTgAD and NTg were studied in parallel using other animals, until their death through natural causes. In 3 xTgAD, with respect to NTg, chemotaxis decreased at all ages studied, whereas in lymphoproliferative response this reduction was shown at 4 months and 9 months. NK activity was diminished only in young 3 xTgAD with respect to NTg. The 3 xTgAD showed a shorter lifespan than the NTg control group. The 3 xTgAD mice show a premature immunosenescence, which could explain their early mortality. The determination of these immune functions at peripheral level could serve as a marker of the progression of the Alzheimer's disease. 
24467380	Curcumin-loaded nanoparticles potently induce adult neurogenesis and reverse cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease model via canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway.
ACS Nano 20131210 2014Jan28
Neurogenesis, a process of generation of new neurons, is reported to be reduced in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Induction of neurogenesis by targeting endogenous neural stem cells (NSC) could be a promising therapeutic approach to such diseases by influencing the brain self-regenerative capacity. Curcumin, a neuroprotective agent, has poor brain bioavailability. Herein, we report that curcumin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles (Cur-PLGA-NPs) potently induce NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation in vitro and in the hippocampus and subventricular zone of adult rats, as compared to uncoated bulk curcumin. Cur-PLGA-NPs induce neurogenesis by internalization into the hippocampal NSC. Cur-PLGA-NPs significantly increase expression of genes involved in cell proliferation (reelin, nestin, and Pax6) and neuronal differentiation (neurogenin, neuroD1, neuregulin, neuroligin, and Stat3). Curcumin nanoparticles increase neuronal differentiation by activating the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, involved in regulation of neurogenesis. These nanoparticles caused enhanced nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin, decreased GSK-3Î² levels, and increased promoter activity of the TCF/LEF and cyclin-D1. Pharmacological and siRNA-mediated genetic inhibition of the Wnt pathway blocked neurogenesis-stimulating effects of curcumin. These nanoparticles reverse learning and memory impairments in an amyloid beta induced rat model of AD-like phenotypes, by inducing neurogenesis. In silico molecular docking studies suggest that curcumin interacts with Wif-1, Dkk, and GSK-3Î². These results suggest that curcumin nanoparticles induce adult neurogenesis through activation of the canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway and may offer a therapeutic approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, by enhancing a brain self-repair mechanism.  
24102355	Dynamin-2 in nervous system disorders.
J. Neurochem. 20131023 2014Jan
Dynamin-2 is a pleiotropic GTPase whose best-known function is related to membrane scission during vesicle budding from the plasma or Golgi membranes. In the nervous system, dynamin-2 participates in synaptic vesicle recycling, post-synaptic receptor internalization, neurosecretion, and neuronal process extension. Some of these functions are shared with the other two dynamin isoforms. However, the involvement of dynamin-2 in neurological illnesses points to a critical function of this isoform in the nervous system. In this regard, mutations in the dynamin-2 gene results in two congenital neuromuscular disorders. One of them, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, affects myelination and peripheral nerve conduction, whereas the other, Centronuclear Myopathy, is characterized by a progressive and generalized atrophy of skeletal muscles, yet it is also associated with abnormalities in the nervous system. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the dynamin-2 gene have been associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. In the present review, we discuss the pathogenic mechanisms implicated in these neurological disorders. 
24117942	Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations at the same codon of amyloid precursor protein differentially alter AÎ² production.
J. Neurochem. 20131024 2014Jan
Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) or Presenilin (PSEN) genes. Studying the mechanisms underlying these mutations can provide insight into the pathways that lead to AD pathology. The majority of biochemical studies on APP mutations to-date have focused on comparing mechanisms between mutations at different codons. It has been assumed that amino acid position is a major determinant of protein dysfunction and clinical phenotype. However, the differential effect of mutations at the same codon has not been sufficiently addressed. In the present study we compared the effects of the aggressive ADAD-associated APP I716F mutation with I716V and I716T on APP processing in human neuroglioma and CHO-K1 cells. All APP I716 mutations increased the ratio of AÎ²42/40 and changed the product line preference of Î³-secretase towards AÎ²38 production. In addition, the APP I716F mutation impaired the Îµ-cleavage and the fourth cleavage of Î³-secretase and led to abnormal APP Î²-CTF accumulation at the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data indicate that APP mutations at the same codon can induce diverse abnormalities in APP processing, some resembling PSEN1 mutations. These differential effects could explain the clinical differences observed among ADAD patients bearing different APP mutations at the same position. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) I716F mutation is associated with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease with the youngest age-at-onset for the APP locus. Here, we describe that this mutation, when compared to two other familial Alzheimer's disease mutations at the same codon (I716V and I716T), interfered distinctly with Î³-secretase cleavage. While all three mutations direct Î³-secretase cleavage towards the 48â†’38 production line, the APP I716F mutation also impaired the Îµ-cleavage and the fourth cleavage of Î³-secretase, resembling a PSEN1 mutation. These features may contribute to the aggressiveness of this mutation. 
24411731	Increased brain penetration and potency of a therapeutic antibody using a monovalent molecular shuttle.
Neuron  2014Jan8
Although biotherapeutics have vast potential for treating brain disorders, their use has been limited due to low exposure across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We report that by manipulating the binding mode of an antibody fragment to the transferrin receptor (TfR), we have developed a Brain Shuttle module, which can be engineered into a standard therapeutic antibody for successful BBB transcytosis. Brain Shuttle version of an anti-AÎ² antibody, which uses a monovalent binding mode to the TfR, increases Î²-Amyloid target engagement in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by 55-fold compared to the parent antibody. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that the monovalent binding mode facilitates transcellular transport, whereas a bivalent binding mode leads to lysosome sorting. Enhanced target engagement of the Brain Shuttle module translates into a significant improvement in amyloid reduction. These findings have major implications for the development of biologics-based treatment of brain disorders. 
24359438	Electronic organiser and Alzheimer's disease: fact or fiction?
Neuropsychol Rehabil 20131223 2014
Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease characterised by a progressive loss of cognitive functions and impairment of activities of daily living severe enough to interfere with normal functioning. To help persons with this disease perform a variety of activities, our research team developed AP@LZ, an electronic organiser specifically designed for them. Two participants with Alzheimer's disease learned how to use AP@LZ in their daily lives by following a structured learning method. After the learning phase, the participants were able to use AP@LZ efficiently and facilitate their day-to-day activities for several months, despite the steady progression of the disease. These results suggest that persons with Alzheimer's disease can learn to use new technologies to compensate for their everyday memory problems, which opens up new rehabilitation possibilities in dementia care.  
24463342	From single target to multitarget/network therapeutics in Alzheimer's therapy.
Pharmaceuticals (Basel) 20140123 2014
Brain network dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves many proteins (enzymes), processes and pathways, which overlap and influence one another in AD pathogenesis. This complexity challenges the dominant paradigm in drug discovery or a single-target drug for a single mechanism. Although this paradigm has achieved considerable success in some particular diseases, it has failed to provide effective approaches to AD therapy. Network medicines may offer alternative hope for effective treatment of AD and other complex diseases. In contrast to the single-target drug approach, network medicines employ a holistic approach to restore network dysfunction by simultaneously targeting key components in disease networks. In this paper, we explore several drugs either in the clinic or under development for AD therapy in term of their design strategies, diverse mechanisms of action and disease-modifying potential. These drugs act as multi-target ligands and may serve as leads for further development as network medicines.  
24591834	Effects of galantamine in a 2-year, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat 20140221 2014
Currently available treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) can produce mild improvements in cognitive function, behavior, and activities of daily living in patients, but their influence on long-term survival is not well established. This study was designed to assess patient survival and drug efficacy following a 2-year galantamine treatment in patients with mild to moderately severe AD. In this multicenter, double-blind study, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive galantamine or placebo. One primary end point was safety; mortality was assessed. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board monitored mortality for the total deaths reaching prespecified numbers, using a time-to-event method and a Cox-regression model. The primary efficacy end point was cognitive change from baseline to month 24, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, analyzed using intent-to-treat analysis with the 'last observation carried forward' approach, in an analysis of covariance model. In all, 1,024 galantamine- and 1,021 placebo-treated patients received study drug, with mean age ~73 years, and mean (standard deviation [SD]) baseline MMSE score of 19 (4.08). A total of 32% of patients (661/2,045) completed the study, 27% (554/2,045) withdrew, and 41% (830/2,045) did not complete the study and were discontinued due to a Data Safety Monitoring Board-recommended early study termination. The mortality rate was significantly lower in the galantamine group versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] =0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37; 0.89) (P=0.011). Cognitive impairment, based on the mean (SD) change in MMSE scores from baseline to month 24, significantly worsened in the placebo (-2.14 [4.34]) compared with the galantamine group (-1.41 [4.05]) (P&lt;0.001). Functional impairment, based on mean (SD) change in the Disability Assessment in Dementia score (secondary end point), at month 24 significantly worsened in the placebo (-10.81 [18.27]) versus the galantamine group (-8.16 [17.25]) (P=0.002). Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were 54.0% for the galantamine and 48.6% for the placebo group. Long-term treatment with galantamine significantly reduced mortality and the decline in cognition and daily living activities, in mild to moderate AD patients. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00679627). 
24121970	Experimental induction of type 2 diabetes in aging-accelerated mice triggered Alzheimer-like pathology and memory deficits.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease constituting ~95% of late-onset non-familial/sporadic AD, and only ~5% accounting for early-onset familial AD. Availability of a pertinent model representing sporadic AD is essential for testing candidate therapies. Emerging evidence indicates a causal link between diabetes and AD. People with diabetes are &gt;1.5-fold more likely to develop AD. Senescence-accelerated mouse model (SAMP8) of accelerated aging displays many features occurring early in AD. Given the role played by diabetes in the pre-disposition of AD, and the utility of SAMP8 non-transgenic mouse model of accelerated aging, we examined if high fat diet-induced experimental type 2 diabetes in SAMP8 mice will trigger pathological aging of the brain. Results showed that compared to non-diabetic SAMP8 mice, diabetic SAMP8 mice exhibited increased cerebral amyloid-Î², dysregulated tau-phosphorylating glycogen synthase kinase 3Î², reduced synaptophysin immunoreactivity, and displayed memory deficits, indicating Alzheimer-like changes. High fat diet-induced type 2 diabetic SAMP8 mice may represent the metabolic model of AD.  
24429902	Etiology and pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Allergy Asthma Rep  2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that occurs in two forms, an early-onset form that is genetically determined and a far more common late-onset form that is not. In both cases, the disease results in severe cognitive dysfunction, among other problems, and the late-onset form of the disease is now considered to be the most common cause of dementia among the elderly. While a good deal of research has been focused on elucidating the etiology of the late-onset form for more than two decades, results to date have been modest and have not yet engendered useful therapeutic strategies for cure of the disease. In this review, we discuss the prevalent ideas that have governed this research for several years, and we challenge these ideas with alternative findings suggesting a multifactorial etiology. We review promising newer ideas that may prove effective as therapeutic interventions for late-onset AD, as well as providing reliable means of earlier and more specific diagnosis of the disease process. In the discussions included here, we reference relevant clinical and basic science literature underlying research into disease etiology and pathogenesis, and we highlight current reviews on the various topics addressed.  
24344744	The role of memory in awareness of memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and brain injury.
J Clin Exp Neuropsychol 20131217 2014
Patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia (Sz), and brain injury (BI) often show memory deficits and lack of awareness of those deficits. This study aimed to investigate the role of memory in awareness of memory deficits and illness in multiple patient groups. Comparison of awareness profiles between groups can reveal common or distinct patterns of awareness and predictors, which may inform theories about the structure of awareness. Using the same standardized measures, AD (N = 27) Sz (N = 31), and BI (N = 26) patients were compared on memory functioning, awareness of illness, and awareness of memory deficits-measured by discrepancy of pretest estimate and actual test scores. All groups were poor at pretest estimation of memory functioning, particularly the AD and BI groups. In AD, patients with the lowest memory functioning rated their performance highest. The BI group and to a lesser extent the AD group showed improved estimations of performance following the memory test. Those with the poorest memory showed the greatest improvement in ratings accuracy post test. The relationship between memory and awareness of memory was stronger than the association between memory and awareness of illness. There was a double dissociation between awareness of memory and awareness of illness across patient groups. The study shows that awareness of memory is linked to memory functioning, while memory is only modestly related to awareness of illness. Dissociations in the role of memory in different domains of awareness and "online" awareness of performance provide information to refine cognitive models of awareness. However, the results should be interpreted with caution given the heterogeneous nature of the sample.  
24454696	Impact of high risk drug use on hospitalization and mortality in older people with and without Alzheimer's disease: a national population cohort study.
PLoS ONE 20140113 2014
Evidence is lacking about outcomes associated with the cumulative use of anticholinergic and sedative drugs in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This retrospective cohort study investigated the relationship between cumulative exposure to anticholinergic and sedative drugs and hospitalization and mortality in people with and without AD in Finland. Community-dwelling people aged 65 years and over, with AD on December 31(st) 2005 (nâ€Š=â€Š16,603) and individually matched (nâ€Š=â€Š16,603) comparison persons (age, sex, region of residence) were identified by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Drug utilization data were extracted from the Finnish National Prescription Register. Exposure to anticholinergic and sedative drugs was defined using the Drug Burden Index (DBI). Hospitalization and mortality data were extracted from national registers. Cox and zero-inflated negative binomial analyses were used to investigate the relationship between DBI and hospitalization and mortality over a one-year follow-up. In total, 5.8% of people with AD and 3.7% without AD died during 2006. For every unit increase in DBI, the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 1.21 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.09-1.33) among people with AD, and 1.37 (95%CI: 1.20-1.56) among people without AD. Overall, 44.3% of people with AD and 33.4% without AD were hospitalized. When using no DBI exposure as the reference group, the adjusted incidence rate ratio for length of hospital stay among high DBI group (â‰¥1) in people with AD was 1.15 (95%CI: 1.05-1.26) and 1.63 (95%CI: 1.41-1.88) in people without AD. There is a dose-response relationship between cumulative anticholinergic and sedative drug use and hospitalization and mortality in people with and without AD. 
23393291	Self-administered intervention for caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease.
Clin Nurs Res 20130206 2014Feb
The purpose of this article is to describe the development and feasibility testing of a Transition Toolkit to support caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in dealing with transitions. Using the Medical Research Council (MRC; UK) guidelines for complex intervention development, Step 1 was to develop a theoretical understanding of the likely processes of change, by reviewing existing evidence and theory, and conducting new primary research. Based on Step 1, the intervention was developed with the Alzheimer's Society experts (Step 2), followed by concept mapping of the critical inputs of the intervention with the theoretical understanding (Step 3). A feasibility study was then conducted with 20 caregivers of persons with AD (Step 4) using a mixed methods concurrent design. The preliminary findings of the pilot study were positive with the participants describing the Transition Toolkit as acceptable, easy to use, and having the potential to help deal with transitions. 
24105468	Parkin overexpression ameliorates hippocampal long-term potentiation and Î²-amyloid load in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
Hum. Mol. Genet. 20131008 2014Feb15
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a severe decline of memory performance. A widely studied AD mouse model is the APPswe/PSEN1Î”E9 (APP/PS1) strain, as mice exhibit amyloid plaques as well as impaired memory capacities. To test whether restoring synaptic plasticity and decreasing Î²-amyloid load by Parkin could represent a potential therapeutic target for AD, we crossed APP/PS1 transgenic mice with transgenic mice overexpressing the ubiquitin ligase Parkin and analyzed offspring properties. Overexpression of Parkin in APP/PS1 transgenic mice restored activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and rescued behavioral abnormalities. Moreover, overexpression of Parkin was associated with down-regulation of APP protein expression, decreased Î²-amyloid load and reduced inflammation. Our data suggest that Parkin could be a promising target for AD therapy.  
24188815	Magnetization transfer contrast imaging reveals amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.
Neuroimage 20131102 2014Feb15
The presence of amyloid plaques in the brain is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, which might already be present in the early stage of the disease. Therefore it is important to track amyloid plaques as early as possible. In this paper, we report magnetization transfer contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MTC MRI) as a novel approach to detect amyloid plaques in vivo. Two mice models, APP/PS1 and BRI, developing amyloid pathology were investigated with MTC MRI, T2 relaxation measurements and immunohistochemistry (IHC). MT-ratios of several brain regions were compared to T2-values and correlated with quantitative IHC, revealing amyloid load and gliosis in different brain regions. APP/PS1 mice develop large compact plaques, resembling late stage Alzheimer's disease, while rather small and diffuse plaques are deposited in BRI mice, reflecting early stage of Alzheimer's disease. We found significantly higher MT-ratio's in the brain of APP/PS1 mice as compared to their controls and similar trends in BRI mice. A region based MT-ratio and IHC analysis and correlations between MT-ratios and quantitative IHC indicate amyloid plaques as the main substrate for altered MT-ratios in transgenic animals. We additionally demonstrated the improved sensitivity of MTC MRI to amyloid pathology as compared to traditional T2 relaxation measurements. Our results suggest that MTC MRI reveals extensive, and potentially even early amyloid pathology. Further unraveling the MT-effect of each pathological feature during each stage of AD might indicate MTC MRI as a useful diagnostic technique.  
24585976	Total-body low-dose irradiation of mice induces neither learning disability and memory impairment in Morris water maze test nor Alzheimer's disease-like pathogensis in the brain.
J. Radiat. Res.  2014Mar1
Purpose: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, while its cause and progression are not well understood [ 1]. The possible cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation are of great concern as humans are exposed to ionizing radiations from various sources including medical diagnosis [ 2]. A recent study in mice reported early transcriptional response in brain to low-dose X-rays (0.10 Gy) suggesting alterations of molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and AD. The present study is to investigate the late pathological, cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation. Materials and methods: C57BL/6J mice were total-body irradiated with an acute dose from X-rays (0.10 Gy) or carbon ions (0.05 or 0.10 Gy). The hippocampus was collected and the expression of 84 AD-related genes was analyzed. Morris water maze test was applied to the measurement of the learning ability and memory of the animals. Amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography were performed to detect the accumulation of fibrillary amyloid Î² peptide (AÎ²), and characteristic pathologies of AD were examined with immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein (APP), AÎ², tau, and phosphorylated tau. Results: For the transcriptional studies, results showed that a few genes out of 84 AD-related genes were significantly up-regulated at 4 h after irradiation and the other genes had no marked change; on the other hand, a few other genes showed a significant down-regulation, while the other genes had no marked change at 1 year after irradiation. For the behavioral studies, no significant difference on learning ability and memory was observed at 1 and 2 years after irradiation. Imaging and immunohistochemical staining showed no change in the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid and the expression of APP, AÎ², tau and phosphorylated tau were detectable in the animals 4 months and 2 years after irradiation. Conclusion: These findings suggest that total-body irradiation at a dose of 0.10 Gy could hardly induce significant early or late transcriptional alterations in most of the AD-related genes in the hippocampus, learning disability and memory impairment, and AD-like pathological change in the brain in mice [ 3].  
24586016	The effects of low doses of proton, iron or silicon radiation on spatial learning in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Radiat. Res.  2014Mar1
Astronauts venturing outside low-Earth orbit risk exposure to charged particle radiation that can cause neurological deficits via oxidative stress, synaptic changes, altered neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. Because these responses are similar to those observed in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesized that individuals with a propensity toward developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) would be more adversely affected by such exposure. To test this hypothesis, we exposed young double transgenic (tg) APP/PSEN1 mice (a commercially available strain engineered to develop AD-like neuropathology) and their wild-type (wt) counterparts to low doses of proton radiation (150 MeV/n, whole body). Spatial learning ability, a sensitive behavioral marker of hippocampal damage, was assessed using the water maze (WM) prior to exposure, then 3 and 6 months post-irradiation. Results showed that wt mice outperformed tg mice at each time-point, and irradiation of tg mice at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1 Gy did not induce spatial learning deficits. However, deficits were observed in wt mice exposed to 0.5 Gy compared with 0 Gy wt controls at 6 months post-irradiation. Specifically, the 0.5 Gy group performed worse than the control group during the reversal learning phase of the WM, when the platform was switched to a new location (P &lt; 0.02). The irradiated mice were unable to alter their search strategy and often perseverated on the previous platform location. Reduced reversal learning demonstrates cognitive inflexibility in novel situations and may be indicative of hippocampal memory system dysfunction. In a follow-up study to assess the effects of high-LET particles on AD-like pathology, we exposed tg mice to low doses (0.1, 0.5 or 1 Gy) of either iron (600 MeV/n) or silicon (250 MeV/n) radiation and assessed the effects on spatial learning ability in the WM at 3 and 6 months post-irradiation. Mice exposed to 1 Gy of iron radiation performed better than 0 Gy tg controls in the WM at the 6 month time-point (P &lt; 0.03). Conversely, mice exposed to 0.1 Gy of silicon radiation performed significantly worse than controls in the WM at the 3 month time-point (P &lt; 0.02), but these deficits had ameliorated by 6 months. Mice exposed to 0.5 and 1 Gy of silicon radiation exhibited changes similar to those observed in the 0.1 Gy group, but the decrements did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that exposure to low doses of iron radiation decreases the behavioral effects of AD-like neuropathology in the long-term, while silicon radiation exacerbates short-term cognitive impairment in individuals with a propensity for such pathology. Electrophysiological and immunohistochemical data are forthcoming, and will aid in elucidating potential mechanisms responsible for the observed effects. Altogether, these results suggest that various types of particles induce different behavioral effects at low doses in APP/PSEN1 tg mice. Namely, proton radiation was found to have no effect on performance, iron radiation improved performance in the long-term and silicon radiation temporarily impaired performance. The finding that low doses of iron and silicon radiation alter performance on a hippocampus-dependent task could have implications for astronauts with a predisposition to developing AD-like neurodegenerative changes who travel on extended missions outside Earth's magnetosphere.  
24595206	Transition-metal-substituted polyoxometalate derivatives as functional anti-amyloid agents for Alzheimer's disease.
Nat Commun 20140304 2014
Inhibitions of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) aggregation and AÎ²-haem peroxidase-like activity have received much attention because these two symptoms can be the primary targets of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, our group found that polyoxometalate (POM) with a Wells-Dawson structure can efficiently inhibit AÎ² aggregation. However, the interaction between POMs and AÎ² is robust, but still needs to improve AÎ² binding affinity. More importantly, it is unclear whether POMs can cross the blood-brain barrier and decrease AÎ²-haem peroxidase-like activity. Here we show that our designed series of transition metal-functionalized POM derivatives with a defined histidine-chelated binding site have much better AÎ² inhibition and peroxidase-like activity inhibition effects than the parent POM. More intriguingly, we show that these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier and are metabolized after 48â€‰h. Our work provides insights into the design, synthesis and screening of inorganic metal compounds as multifunctional therapeutic agents against AD.

Friends, exhibitors and media partners also helped financially support the conference.  
24399640	Injection of Î²-amyloid into the hippocampus induces metabolic disturbances and involuntary weight loss which may be early indicators of Alzheimer's disease.
Aging Clin Exp Res 20140108 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes, two diseases that contribute considerable morbidity and mortality in middle-age and elderly people, coexist and progress in parallel, leading to the presumption that one may cause the other. However, a causative link has not yet been established. This study used non-diabetic and diabetic rats injected with Î²-amyloid (25-35) into the CA1 of the hippocampus to induce AD like plaques as a model of early-stage AD to evaluate the effects of AD on energy metabolism. AD like cognitive dysfunction was confirmed using passive avoidance tests and Morris water maze tests. Diabetic and non-diabetic rats with experimental AD exhibited memory deficits by Î²-amyloid (25-35) accumulation in the hippocampus, but diabetes exacerbated memory impairment. All rats, diabetic and non-diabetic, infused with Î²-amyloid had profound decreases in energy intake, activity and fat oxidation and increased carbohydrate oxidation and energy expenditure. Energy expenditure was increased by 8-10 % and energy intake decreased by approximately 20 % in the rats injected with Î²-amyloid regardless of diabetic status. These results suggest that AD type plaques in the brain may induce metabolic disturbances and cachexia in early AD, which may be an early warning sign of AD in humans. 
24448248	Republished: the role of amyloid Î² in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Postgrad Med J  2014Feb
The amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) is widely considered to be the major toxic agent in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a condition which afflicts approximately 36 million people worldwide. Despite a plethora of studies stretching back over two decades, identifying the toxic AÎ² species has proved difficult. Debate has centred on the AÎ² fibril and oligomer. Despite support from numerous experimental models, important questions linger regarding the role of the AÎ² oligomer in particular. It is likely a huge array of oligomers, rather than a single species, which cause toxicity. Reappraisal of the role of the AÎ² fibril points towards a dynamic relationship with the AÎ² oligomer within an integrated system, as supported by evidence from microglia. However, some continue to doubt the pathological role of amyloid Î², instead proposing a protective role. If the field is to progress, all AÎ² oligomers should be characterised, the nomenclature revised and a consistent experimental protocol defined. For this to occur, collaboration will be required between major research groups and innovative analytical tools developed. Such action must surely be taken if amyloid-based therapeutic endeavour is to progress.  
23753528	Calcium regulation of neural rhythms, memory and Alzheimer's disease.
J. Physiol. (Lond.) 20130610 2014Jan15
Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins with a decline in cognition followed by neuronal cell death and dementia. These changes have been linked to a deregulation of Ca(2+) signalling caused by a progressive increase in the resting level of Ca(2+), which may influence cognition by interfering with the rhythm rheostat that controls the sleep/wake cycle. The rise in resting levels of Ca(2+) may not alter the processes of memory acquisition during consciousness (gamma and theta rhythms), but may duplicate some of the events that occur during the slow oscillations responsible for the twin processes of memory consolidation and memory erasure that occur during sleep. The persistent elevation in the resting level of Ca(2+) induced by an accumulation of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) oligomers duplicates a similar small global elevation normally restricted to the period of slow oscillations when memories are erased during sleep. In AD, such a rapid erasure of memories soon after they are acquired during the wake period means that they are not retained for consolidation during sleep. The AÎ² deregulates Ca(2+) signalling through direct effects on the neurons and indirectly by inducing inflammatory responses in the microglia and astrocytes. Some of these deleterious effects of AÎ² may be alleviated by vitamin D.  
24326531	Association between Alzheimer disease and the -491T allele of regulatory region polymorphism of Apolipoprotein E in a Tunisian population.
Neurochem. Res. 20131211 2014Feb
The apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a well-established risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several studies have attempted to confirm the association between the polymorphism located at position -491 in the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene and AD. We examined in 85 AD patients and 90 control subjects of a Tunisian population the potential involvement of this polymorphism as a risk factor for AD, either through an independent effect or through interaction with the existing APOE Îµ4 allele risk. The T allele frequency was significantly higher in the AD patients group (45.3Â %) than in the controls group (32.78Â %) and may possibly constitute a significant risk factor for AD. The APOE Îµ4 allele did not influence the distribution of the -491 polymorphism after stratification.  
24338370	Early differences in dorsal hippocampal metabolite levels in males but not females in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurochem. Res. 20131217 2014Feb
McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats express the human amyloid precursor protein carrying the Swedish and Indiana mutations. We examined the neurochemical content of the dorsal hippocampus in three-months-old male and female transgenic rats and healthy age- and gender-matched controls using in vivo (1)H MRS in order to assess early metabolite alterations and whether these were similar for both genders. Whereas male and female controls had similar levels of all metabolites, differences were evident between male and female McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats. Compared with McGill-R-Thy1-APP females, McGill-R-Thy1-APP males had lower levels of myo-inositol and N-acetylaspartate (NAA). No differences in metabolite levels were evident when female control and McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats were compared, whereas McGill-R-Thy1-APP males had lower levels of glutamate, NAA and total choline compared with male controls. In addition to metabolite concentrations, metabolite ratios are reported as these are widely used. The results from this preliminary study demonstrate early metabolite alterations in the dorsal hippocampus of males in this rat model of Alzheimer's disease, and imply that very early possible neurochemical markers of the disease are different for males and females.  
24379109	1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) mitigates inflammation in amyloid Beta toxicated PC12 cells: relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
Neurochem. Res. 20131231 2014Feb
Inflammatory process has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and insoluble amyloid beta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles provide the obvious stimuli for inflammation. The present study demonstrate the effect of pretreatment of 1,8-cineole (Cin) on inflammation induced by AÎ²(25-35) in differentiated PC12 cells. The cells were treated with Cin at different doses for 24Â h and then replaced by media containing AÎ²(25-35) for another 24Â h. The cell viability was decreased in AÎ²(25-35) treated cells which was significantly restored by Cin pretreatment. Cin successfully reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS and NO levels in AÎ²(25-35) treated cells. Cin also lowered the levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and IL-6 in AÎ²(25-35) treated cells. Moreover, Cin also succeeded in lowering the expression of NOS-2, COX-2 and NF-ÎºB. This study suggests the protective effects of Cin on inflammation and provides additional evidence for its potential beneficial use in therapy as an anti-inflammatory agent in neurodegenerative disease.  
24528486	Phenotypic profile of alternative activation marker CD163 is different in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
Acta Neuropathol Commun 20140214 2014
Microglial activation is a pathological feature common to both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD). The classical activation involves release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This is necessary for maintenance of tissue homeostasis and host defense, but can cause bystander damage when the activation is sustained and uncontrolled. In recent years the heterogeneous nature of microglial activation states in neurodegenerative diseases has become clear and the focus has shifted to alternative activation states that promote tissue maintenance and repair. We studied the distribution of CD163, a membrane-bound scavenger receptor found on perivascular macrophages. CD163 has an immunoregulatory function, and has been found in the parenchyma in other inflammatory diseases e.g. HIV-encephalitis and multiple sclerosis. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to compare CD163 immunoreactivity in 31 AD cases, 27 PD cases, and 16 control cases. Associations of microglia with pathological hallmarks of AD and PD were investigated using double immunofluorescence. Parenchymal microglia were found to be immunoreactive for CD163 in all of the AD cases, and to a lesser extent in PD cases. There was prominent staining of CD163 immunoreactive microglia in the frontal and occipital cortices of AD cases, and in the brainstem of PD cases. Many of them were associated with AÃŸ plaques in both diseases, and double staining with CD68 demonstrates their phagocytic capability. Leakage of fibrinogen was observed around compromised blood vessels, raising the possibility these microglia might have originated from the periphery. Increase in microglia's CD163 immunoreactivity was more significant in AD than PD, and association of CD163 immunoreactive microglia with AÎ² plaques indicate microglia's attraction towards extracellular protein pathology, i.e. extracellular aggregates of AÎ² as compared to intracellular Lewy Bodies in PD. Double staining with CD163 and CD68 might point towards their natural inclination to phagocytose plaques. Fibrinogen leakage and compromise of the blood brain barrier raise the possibility that these are not resident microglia, but systemic macrophages infiltrating the brain. 
24279329	The role of protein glycosylation in Alzheimer disease.
FEBS J. 20131126 2014Jan
Glycosylation is one of the most common, and the most complex, forms of post-translational modification of proteins. This review serves to highlight the role of protein glycosylation in Alzheimer disease (AD), a topic that has not been thoroughly investigated, although glycosylation defects have been observed in AD patients. The major pathological hallmarks in AD are neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of phosphorylated tau, and the plaques are composed of amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²), which is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Defects in glycosylation of APP, tau and other proteins have been reported in AD. Another interesting observation is that the two proteases required for the generation of amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²), i.e. Î³-secretase and Î²-secretase, also have roles in protein glycosylation. For instance, Î³-secretase and Î²-secretase affect the extent of complex N-glycosylation and sialylation of APP, respectively. These processes may be important in AD pathogenesis, as proper intracellular sorting, processing and export of APP are affected by how it is glycosylated. Furthermore, lack of one of the key components of Î³-secretase, presenilin, leads to defective glycosylation of many additional proteins that are related to AD pathogenesis and/or neuronal function, including nicastrin, reelin, butyrylcholinesterase, cholinesterase, neural cell adhesion molecule, v-ATPase, and tyrosine-related kinaseÂ B. Improved understanding of the effects of AD on protein glycosylation, and viceÂ versa, may therefore be important for improving the diagnosis and treatment of AD patients.  
24291393	Effects of C-glycosylation on anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer's disease and anti-inflammatory potential of apigenin.
Food Chem. Toxicol. 20131127 2014Feb
Apigenin has gained particular interests in recent years as a beneficial and health promoting agent because of its low intrinsic toxicity. Vitexin and isovitexin, naturally occurring C-glycosylated derivatives of apigenin, have been known to possess potent anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer's disease (anti-AD), and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study was designed to investigate the anti-diabetic, anti-AD, and anti-inflammatory potential of apigenin and its two C-glycosylated derivatives, vitexin and isovitexin by in vitro assays including rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), human recombinant aldose reductase (HRAR), advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), Î²-site amyloid precursor (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Among them, isovitexin was found as the most potent inhibitor against RLAR, HRAR, AGE, AChE, and BChE while vitexin showed the most potent PTP1B inhibitory activity. Despite the relatively weak anti-diabetic and anti-AD potentials, apigenin showed powerful antiinflammatory activity by inhibiting NO production and iNOS and COX-2 expression while vitexin and isovitexin were inactive. Therefore, it could be speculated that C-glycosylation of apigenin at different positions might be closely linked to relative intensity of anti-diabetic, anti-AD, and anti-inflammatory potentials.  
24361131	Single nucleotide polymorphism rs7294919 on chromosome 12q24.22 is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.
Neurosci. Lett. 20131217 2014Feb7
Recently, two large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several variants at 12q14 and 12q24 which are associated with hippocampal volume, one of the most important biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The strongest association was reported for the rs7294919 polymorphism on chromosome 12q24.22. In order to explore whether rs7294919 polymorphism was also associated with late-onset AD (LOAD) risk, we recruited 1132 LOAD patients and 1159 sex- and age-matched healthy controls in the study. The results showed that rs7294919 polymorphism was significantly associated with LOAD (genotype P&lt;0.01, allele P=0.02). After stratification by APOE, significant difference was only observed in non-APOE É›4 carriers (P=0.01). Logistic regression demonstrated that the C allele at rs7294919 was a risk factor for LOAD in dominant and recessive models after adjusting for age, gender and the APOE É›4 carrier status. In conclusion, our study demonstrates an association of rs7294919 polymorphism locus on chromosome 12q24.22 with risk for LOAD in Han Chinese.  
24570669	Visual cortex in aging and Alzheimer's disease: changes in visual field maps and population receptive fields.
Front Psychol 20140207 2014
Although several studies have suggested that cortical alterations underlie such age-related visual deficits as decreased acuity, little is known about what changes actually occur in visual cortex during healthy aging. Two recent studies showed changes in primary visual cortex (V1) during normal aging; however, no studies have characterized the effects of aging on visual cortex beyond V1, important measurements both for understanding the aging process and for comparison to changes in age-related diseases. Similarly, there is almost no information about changes in visual cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Because visual deficits are often reported as one of the first symptoms of AD, measurements of such changes in the visual cortex of AD patients might improve our understanding of how the visual system is affected by neurodegeneration as well as aid early detection, accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of AD. Here we use fMRI to first compare the visual field map (VFM) organization and population receptive fields (pRFs) between young adults and healthy aging subjects for occipital VFMs V1, V2, V3, and hV4. Healthy aging subjects do not show major VFM organizational deficits, but do have reduced surface area and increased pRF sizes in the foveal representations of V1, V2, and hV4 relative to healthy young control subjects. These measurements are consistent with behavioral deficits seen in healthy aging. We then demonstrate the feasibility and first characterization of these measurements in two patients with mild AD, which reveal potential changes in visual cortex as part of the pathophysiology of AD. Our data aid in our understanding of the changes in the visual processing pathways in normal aging and provide the foundation for future research into earlier and more definitive detection of AD.  
24575113	Association between the COMTVal158Met Genotype and Alzheimer's Disease in the Han Chinese Population.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra 20140131 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide and is associated with individual, familial and social burdens. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) may have a prominent role in AD pathophysiology by affecting the metabolism of catecholamine neurotransmitters and estrogen. Although the COMT rs4680 gene polymorphism has been investigated as a susceptibility factor for AD, the results are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of the COMT rs4680 gene polymorphism as a risk factor for AD in the Han Chinese population and its synergistic effect with the apolipoprotein E (APOE)gene. A total of 137 AD patients and 194 healthy controls were analyzed. Clinical criteria and neuropsychological tests were used to establish diagnostic groups. All subjects were analyzed for the COMTrs4680 polymorphism and APOEgenotype. No significant differences were observed between AD and control subjects regarding the COMT genotype frequencies of Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met, but Met alleles were higher in AD than in control subjects (35.4 and 28.1%, p = 0.045). A minor synergistic effect between the genotypes GG and APOEÎµ4 was observed in AD patients (OR: 5.707, 95% CI: 2.505-13.002, p &lt; 0.001). This synergistic effect was greater in women, who showed higher OR of AD (16.007, 95% CI: 4.606-56.118, p &lt; 0.001) versus the AD group with APOE Îµ4 (11.972, 95% CI: 5.534-25.902, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the COMT Met allele was an independent risk factor for AD without APOE Îµ4 allele carriers (OR: 1.806, 95% CI: 1.160-2.810, p = 0.009), especially in men (OR: 4.904, 95% CI: 2.381-10.099, p &lt; 0.001). The COMT(Val158Met) polymorphism is not an independent risk factor for AD but shows a synergistic effect between the genotypes GG and APOEÎµ4 that proves greater in women with AD. The COMT Met allele represents a risk factor in AD without APOE Îµ4 allele carriers, which is notable in men with AD. 
24575114	Postural stability analysis with inertial measurement units in Alzheimer's disease.
Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra 20140131 2014Jan
The cause of frequent falls in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still not well understood. Nevertheless, balance control and sensory organization are known to be critical for moving safely and adapting to the environment. We evaluated postural stability in 20 AD patients (11 fallers and 9 nonfallers) and 16 healthy controls with an inertial measurement unit (triaxial accelerometers and gyroscopes) attached to the center of mass (COM) in different balance conditions (Romberg on flat surface and frontward/backward-inclined surface, with or without visual suppression) in a motor lab. In AD patients, the group of fallers showed a different kinetic pattern of postural stability characterized by higher vulnerability to visual suppression, higher total/maximal displacement and a mediolateral/anteroposterior range of sway, and a consequent need for more corrections of COM pitch and roll angles. Further studies are needed to consolidate the normative values of the discriminatory kinetic variables with the potential of inclusion in a multifactorial analysis of the risk of falls. Nevertheless, these results highlight signs of impairment of central postural control in AD, which may require early therapeutic intervention. 
24325852	Pharmacophore mapping-based virtual screening followed by molecular docking studies in search of potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as anti-Alzheimer's agents.
BioSystems 20131208 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is turning out to be one of the lethal diseases in older people. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a crucial target in designing of drugs against AD. The present in silico study was carried out to explore natural compounds as potential AChE inhibitors. Virtual screening, via drug-like ADMET filter, best pharmacophore model and molecular docking analyses, has been utilized to identify putative novel AChE inhibitors. The InterBioScreen's Natural Compound (NC) database was first filtered by applying drug-like ADMET properties and then with the pharmacophore-based virtual screening followed by molecular docking analyses. Based on docking score, interaction patterns and calculated activity, the final hits were selected and these consist of coumarin and non-coumarin classes of compounds. Few hits were found to have been already reported for their AChE inhibitory activity in different literatures confirming reliability of our pharmacophore model. The remaining hits are suggested to be potential AChE inhibitors for AD.  
24333505	Analysis of 27 vascular-related proteins reveals that NT-proBNP is a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a pilot-study.
Exp. Gerontol. 20131210 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease. Cerebrovascular changes often accompany AD-related pathology. Despite a considerable progress in the diagnostic accuracy of AD, no blood biomarkers have been established so far. The aim of the present study was to search for changes in plasma levels of 27 vascular-related proteins of healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. In a sample of 80 participants we showed that out of these 27 proteins, six proteins were slightly changed (up to 1.5Ã—) in AD (alpha2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein-A1, plasminogen activator inhibitor, RAGE, Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases-1 and Trombospondin-2) and one marker (serum amyloid A) was enhanced up to 6Ã— but with a very high variance. However, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was significantly enhanced both in MCI and AD patients (1.9Ã—). In a second analysis of a sample of 110 subjects including younger healthy controls, we confirmed that NT-proBNP has the potential to be a stable candidate protein for both diagnosis and AD disease progression.  
24445040	Special lipid-based diets alleviate cognitive deficits in the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease independent of brain amyloid deposition.
J. Nutr. Biochem. 20131106 2014Feb
Dietary fish oil, providing n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), associates with reduced dementia risk in epidemiological studies and reduced amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer mouse models. We now studied whether additional nutrients can improve the efficacy of fish oil in alleviating cognitive deficits and amyloid pathology in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic and wild-type mice. We compared four isocaloric (5% fat) diets. The fish oil diet differed from the control diet only by substituted fish oil. Besides fish oil, the plant sterol diet was supplemented with phytosterols, while the Fortasyn diet contained as supplements precursors and cofactors for membrane synthesis, viz. uridine-monophosphate; DHA and EPA; choline; folate; vitamins B6, B12, C and E; phospholipids and selenium. Mice began the special diets at 5 months and were sacrificed at 14 months after behavioral testing. Transgenic mice, fed with control chow, showed poor spatial learning, hyperactivity in exploring a novel cage and reduced preference to explore novel odors. All fish-oil-containing diets increased exploration of a novel odor over a familiar one. Only the Fortasyn diet alleviated the spatial learning deficit. None of the diets influenced hyperactivity in a new environment. Fish-oil-containing diets strongly inhibited Î²- and Î³-secretase activity, and the plant sterol diet additionally reduced amyloid-Î² 1-42 levels. These data indicate that beneficial effects of fish oil on cognition in Alzheimer model mice can be enhanced by adding other specific nutrients, but this effect is not necessarily mediated via reduction of amyloid accumulation.  
23808763	Patterns of cerebral amyloid angiopathy define histopathological phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol.  2014Feb
Pathological heterogeneity of AÎ² deposition in senile plaques (SP) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been long noted. The aim of this study was to classify cases of AD according to their pattern of AÎ² deposition, and to seek factors which might predict, or predispose towards, this heterogeneity. The form, distribution and severity of AÎ² deposition (as SP and/or CAA) was assessed semiquantitatively in immunostained sections of frontal, temporal and occipital cortex from 134 pathologically confirmed cases of AD. Four patterns of AÎ² deposition were defined. Type 1 describes cases predominantly with SP, with or without CAA within leptomeningeal vessels alone. Type 2 describes cases where, along with many SP, CAA is present in both leptomeningeal and deeper penetrating arteries. Type 3 describes cases where capillary CAA is present along with SP and arterial CAA. Type 4 describes a predominantly vascular phenotype, where AÎ² deposition is much more prevalent in and around blood vessels, than as SP. As would be anticipated from the group definitions, there were significant differences in the distribution and degree of CAA across the phenotype groups, although AÎ² deposition as SP did not vary. There were no significant differences between phenotype groups with regard to age of onset, age at death, disease duration and brain weight, or disease presentation. Women were over-represented in the type 1 phenotype and men in type 2. Genetically, type 3 (capillary subtype) cases were strongly associated with possession of the APOE Îµ4 allele. This study offers an alternative method of pathologically classifying cases of AD. Further studies may derive additional genetic, environmental or clinical factors which associate with, or may be responsible for, these varying pathological presentations of AD. 
24033439	Phosphorylation of tau protein at sites Ser(396-404) is one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome.
Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol.  2014Feb
Phosphorylation, conformational changes and cleavage of tau protein have been widely suggested to contribute to abnormal tau processing in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as well as in other tauopathies. Consistently, many phosphorylated sites, such as Ser(199-202) -Thr(205) and Ser(396-404) , have been associated with this pathological processing. The present study examined the chronological appearance of phosphorylation during the neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) evolution in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Down syndrome. Immunohistochemistry for modified tau [phosphorylated at Ser(199-202) -Thr(205) (AT8) and Ser(396-404) (PHF-1) or truncated at D(421) (TauC3) and E(391) (MN423)] was performed on paraffin-embedded human brain sections. Double immunofluorescence for phosphorylated and truncated tau was used to detect intensity and distribution of tau immunoreactivity, and provided detailed characterization of NFT pathology. Phosphorylation at sites Ser(396-404) was significantly increased when compared with phosphorylations at sites Ser(199-202) -Thr(205) . Around 50% of the total structures containing phosphorylation at sites Ser(396-404) were found as early phospho-tau aggregates with a well-preserved neuronal soma. Phosphorylation of tau protein at sites Ser(396) coexists with early and late truncation events. Tau abnormal processing in Down syndrome consistently showed similar alterations as observed in AD. Phosphorylation of tau protein at the carboxyl terminus may be among the earliest tau events, and it occurs prior to the apparition of the classical fibrillar structure. Finally, these data validate PHF-1 as an efficient marker for AD cytopathology following the progression of tau aggregation into NFT. 
24443964	Review: The genetics of Alzheimer's disease; putting flesh on the bones.
Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol.  2014Feb
For two decades the search for genes involved in Alzheimer's disease brought little reward; it was not until the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that genetic associations started to be revealed. Since 2009 increasingly large GWAS have revealed 20 loci, which in itself is a substantial increase in our understanding, but perhaps the more important feature is that these studies have highlighted novel pathways that are potentially involved in the disease process. This commentary assembles our latest knowledge while acknowledging that the casual functional variants, and undoubtedly, other genes are still yet to be discovered.â€‰This is the challenge that remains and the promise of next-generation sequencing is anticipated as there are a number of large initiatives which themselves should start to yield information before long.  
24300213	Intranasal nanoparticles of basic fibroblast growth factor for brain delivery to treat Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Pharm 20131201 2014Jan30
Disabilities caused by neurodegeneration have become one of the main causes of mortality in elderly population, with drug distribution to the brain remaining one of the most difficult challenges in the treatment of the central nervous system (CNS) diseases due to the existence of blood-brain barrier. Lectins modified polyethylene glycol-polylactide-polyglycolide (PEG-PLGA) nanoparticles could enhance the drug delivery to the brain following intranasal administration. In this study, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was entrapped in nanoparticles conjugated with Solanum tuberosum lectin (STL), which selectively binds to N-acetylglucosamine on the nasal epithelial membrane for its brain delivery. The resulting nanoparticles had uniform particle size and negative zeta potential. The brain distribution of the formulations following intranasal administration was assessed using radioisotopic tracing method. The areas under the concentration-time curve of (125)I-bFGF in the olfactory bulb, cerebrum, and cerebellum of rats following nasal application of STL modified nanoparticles (STL-bFGF-NP) were 1.79-5.17 folds of that of rats with intravenous administration, and 0.61-2.21 and 0.19-1.07 folds higher compared with intranasal solution and unmodified nanoparticles, respectively. Neuroprotective effect was evaluated using Mirror water maze task in rats with intracerebroventricular injection of Î²-amyloid25-35 and ibotenic acid. The spatial learning and memory of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats in STL-bFGF-NP group were significantly improved compared with AD model group, and were also better than other preparations. The results were consistent with the value of choline acetyltransferase activity of rat hippocampus as well as the histological observations of rat hippocampal region. The histopathology assays also confirmed the in vivo safety of STL-bFGF-NP. These results clearly indicated that STL-NP was a promising drug delivery system for peptide and protein drugs such as bFGF to enter the CNS and play the therapeutic role.  
24307730	Th1 polarization of T cells injected into the cerebrospinal fluid induces brain immunosurveillance.
J. Immunol. 20131204 2014Jan1
Although CD4 T cells reside within the cerebrospinal fluid, it is yet unclear whether and how they enter the brain parenchyma and migrate to target specific Ags. We examined the ability of Th1, Th2, and Th17 CD4 T cells injected intracerebroventricularly to migrate from the lateral ventricles into the brain parenchyma in mice. We show that primarily Th1 cells cross the ependymal layer of the ventricle and migrate within the brain parenchyma by stimulating an IFN-Î³-dependent dialogue with neural cells, which maintains the effector function of the T cells. When injected into a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-Î² (AÎ²)-specific Th1 cells target AÎ² plaques, increase AÎ² uptake, and promote neurogenesis with no evidence of pathogenic autoimmunity or neuronal loss. Overall, we provide a mechanistic insight to the migration of cerebrospinal fluid CD4 T cells into the brain parenchyma and highlight implications on brain immunity and repair.  
24315156	Vaccine efficacy of transcutaneous immunization with amyloid Î² using a dissolving microneedle array in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neuroimmunol. 20131111 2014Jan15
Vaccine therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis has recently attracted attention for treating AD. Injectable immunization using amyloid Î² peptide (AÎ²) comprising 1-42 amino-acid residues (AÎ²1-42) as antigens showed therapeutic efficacy in mice; however, the clinical trial of this injected AÎ²1-42 vaccine was stopped due to the incidence of meningoencephalitis caused by excess activation of Th1 cells infiltrating the brain as a serious adverse reaction. Because recent studies have suggested that transcutaneous immunization (TCI) is likely to elicit Th2-dominant immune responses, TCI is expected to be effective in treating AD without inducing adverse reactions. Previously reported TCI procedures employed complicated and impractical vaccination procedures; therefore, a simple, easy-to-use, and novel TCI approach needs to be established. In this study, we investigated the vaccine efficacy of an AÎ²1-42-containing TCI using our novel dissolving microneedle array (MicroHyala; MH) against AD. MH-based TCI induced anti-AÎ²1-42 immune responses by simple and low-invasive application of AÎ²1-42-containing MH to the skin. Unfortunately, this TCI system resulted in little significant improvement in cognitive function and Th2-dominant immune responses, suggesting the need for further modification.  
23736221	The sex-specific associations of the aromatase gene with Alzheimer's disease and its interaction with IL10 in the Epistasis Project.
Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 20130605 2014Feb
Epistasis between interleukin-10 (IL10) and aromatase gene polymorphisms has previously been reported to modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, although the main effects of aromatase variants suggest a sex-specific effect in AD, there has been insufficient power to detect sex-specific epistasis between these genes to date. Here we used the cohort of 1757 AD patients and 6294 controls in the Epistasis Project. We replicated the previously reported main effects of aromatase polymorphisms in AD risk in women, for example, adjusted odds ratio of disease for rs1065778 GG=1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.48, P=0.03). We also confirmed a reported epistatic interaction between IL10 rs1800896 and aromatase (CYP19A1) rs1062033, again only in women: adjusted synergy factor=1.94 (1.16-3.25, 0.01). Aromatase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of estrogens, is expressed in AD-relevant brain regions ,and is downregulated during the disease. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Given that estrogens have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities and regulate microglial cytokine production, epistasis is biologically plausible. Diminishing serum estrogen in postmenopausal women, coupled with suboptimal brain estrogen synthesis, may contribute to the inflammatory state, that is a pathological hallmark of AD.  
24520910	German adaptation of the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health II: study protocol of a single-centred, randomised controlled trial.
BMC Geriatr 20140212 2014
Caring for a family member with dementia is extremely stressful, and contributes to psychiatric and physical illness among caregivers. Therefore, a comprehensive programme called Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health II (REACH II) was developed in the United States to enhance the health of Alzheimer's caregivers. REACH II causes a clear reduction of the stress and burdens faced by informal caregivers at home. The aim of this protocol is to adapt, apply, and evaluate this proven intervention programme in a German-speaking area for the first time. This newly adapted intervention is called Deutsche Adaption der Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (DeREACH). A total of 138 informal caregivers at home are recruited in a single-centred, randomised controlled trial. The intervention (DeREACH) consists of nine home visits and three telephone contacts over six months, all of which focus on safety, psychological well-being and self-care, social support, problem behaviour and preventive health-related behaviours. A complex intervention assessment on effectiveness will be adopted when the primary outcome - namely, the reduction of caregiver burden - and other secondary outcomes, including changes with regard to anxiety and depression, somatisation, health-related quality of life, and perceived social support, are measured at baseline, as well as immediately and three months after the intervention. The change from baseline to post-intervention assessment with regard to the primary outcome will be compared between treatment and control group using t-tests for independent samples. It is anticipated that this study will show that DeREACH effectively reduces caregiver burden and therefore works under the conditions of a local German health-care system. If successful, this programme will provide an effective intervention programme in the German-speaking area to identify and develop the personal capabilities of informal caregivers to cope with the burdens of caring for people with dementia. 
24251806	Donepezil: an important prototype to the design of new drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease.
Mini Rev Med Chem  2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and incurable neurodegenerative disorder, with a dramatic socioeconomic impact. The progress of AD is characterized by a severe loss in memory and cognition, leading to behavioral changing, depression and death. During the last decades, only a few anticholinergic drugs were launched in the market, mainly acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), with indications for the treatment of initial and moderate stages of AD. The search for new AChEIs, capable to overcome the limitations observed for rivastigmine and tacrine, led Sugimoto and co-workers to the discovery of donepezil. Besides its high potency, donepezil also exhibited high selectivity for AChE and a very low toxicity. In this review, we discuss the main structural and pharmacological attributes that have made donepezil the first choice medicine for AD, and a versatile structural model for the design of novel AChEIs, in spite of multipotent and multitarget-directed ligands. Many recent data from literature transdue great efforts worldwide to produce modifications in the donepezil structure that could result in new bioactive chemical entities with innovative structural pattern. Furthermore, multi-potent ligands have also been designed by molecular hybridization, affording rivastigmine-, tacrine- and huperzine-donepezil potent and selective AChEIs. In a more recent strategy, structural features of donepezil have been used as a model to design multitarget-directed ligands, aiming at the discovery of new effective drug candidates that could exhibit concomitant pharmacological activities as dual or multi- enzymatic inhibitors as genuine innovative therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of AD.  
24273007	Mildronate improves cognition and reduces amyloid-Î² pathology in transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice.
J. Neurosci. Res. 20131122 2014Mar
Mildronate, a carnitine congener drug, previously has been shown to provide neuroprotection in an azidothymidine-induced mouse model of neurotoxicity and in a Parkinson's disease rat model. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mildronate treatment on cognition and pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice (APP(SweDI)). Mildronate was administered i.p. daily at 50 or 100 mg/kg for 28 days. At the end of treatment, the animals were behaviorally and cognitively tested, and brains were assessed for AD-related pathology, inflammation, synaptic markers, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The data show that mildronate treatment significantly improved animal performance in water maze and social recognition tests, lowered amyloid-Î² deposition in the hippocampus, increased expression of the microglia marker Iba-1, and decreased AChE staining, although it did not alter expression of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity (GAP-43, synaptophysin, and GAD67). Taken together, these findings indicate mildronate's ability to improve cognition and reduce amyloid-Î² pathology in a mouse model of AD and its possible therapeutic utility as a disease-modifying drug in AD patients. 
24372615	Familial Alzheimer A2 V mutation reduces the intrinsic disorder and completely changes the free energy landscape of the AÎ²1-28 monomer.
J Phys Chem B 20140107 2014Jan16
The self-assembly of the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide of 39-43 amino acids into senile plaques is one hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. While A2 V carriers remain healthy in the heterozygous state, they suffer from early onset AD in the homozygous state. As a first toward understanding the impact of A2 V on AÎ² at its earlier stage, we characterized the equilibrium ensemble of the AÎ²1-28 wild type and AÎ²1-28 A2 V monomers by means of extensive atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. While global conformational properties such as the radius of gyration and the average secondary structure content of the whole peptides are very similar, the population of Î²-hairpins is increased by a factor of 4 in A2 V, and this may explain the enhanced AÎ²1-40 A2 V aggregation kinetics with respect to AÎ²1-40 wild type. Both peptides display a non-negligible population of extended metastable conformations differing however in their atomic details that represent ideal seeds for polymerization. Remarkably, upon A2 V mutation, the intrinsic disorder of AÎ²1-28 monomer is reduced by a factor of 2, and the free energy landscape is completely different. This difference in the conformational ensembles of the two peptides may explain in part why the mixture of the AÎ²40 WT and A2 V peptides protects against AD.  
23868612	Use of a benzimidazole derivative BF-188 in fluorescence multispectral imaging for selective visualization of tau protein fibrils in the Alzheimer's disease brain.
Mol Imaging Biol  2014Feb
Selective visualization of amyloid-Î² and tau protein deposits will help to understand the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we introduce a novel fluorescent probe that can distinguish between these two deposits by multispectral fluorescence imaging technique. Fluorescence spectral analysis was performed using AD brain sections stained with novel fluorescence compounds. Competitive binding assay using [(3)H]-PiB was performed to evaluate the binding affinity of BF-188 for synthetic amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and tau fibrils. In AD brain sections, BF-188 clearly stained AÎ² and tau protein deposits with different fluorescence spectra. In vitro binding assays indicated that BF-188 bound to both amyloid-Î² and tau fibrils with high affinity (K i â€‰&lt;â€‰10 nM). In addition, BF-188 showed an excellent blood-brain barrier permeability in mice. Multispectral imaging with BF-188 could potentially be used for selective in vivo imaging of tau deposits as well as amyloid-Î² in the brain. 
24022672	7,8-dihydroxyflavone prevents synaptic loss and memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychopharmacology 20130911 2014Feb
Synaptic loss in the brain correlates well with disease severity in Alzheimer disease (AD). Deficits in brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB) signaling contribute to the synaptic dysfunction of AD. We have recently identified 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a potent TrkB agonist that displays therapeutic efficacy toward various neurological diseases. Here we tested the effect of 7,8-DHF on synaptic function in an AD model both in vitro and in vivo. 7,8-DHF protected primary neurons from AÎ²-induced toxicity and promoted dendrite branching and synaptogenesis. Chronic oral administration of 7,8-DHF activated TrkB signaling and prevented AÎ² deposition in transgenic mice that coexpress five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (5XFAD mice). Moreover, 7,8-DHF inhibited the loss of hippocampal synapses, restored synapse number and synaptic plasticity, and prevented memory deficits. These results suggest that 7,8-DHF represents a novel oral bioactive therapeutic agent for treating AD.  
23919677	Calpain cleavage and inactivation of the sodium calcium exchanger-3 occur downstream of AÎ² in Alzheimer's disease.
Aging Cell 20130918 2014Feb
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological deposits of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) in senile plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprising hyperphosphorylated aggregated tau, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Substantial evidence indicates that disrupted neuronal calcium homeostasis is an early event in AD that could mediate synaptic dysfunction and neuronal toxicity. Sodium calcium exchangers (NCXs) play important roles in regulating intracellular calcium, and accumulating data suggests that reduced NCX function, following aberrant proteolytic cleavage of these exchangers, may contribute to neurodegeneration. Here, we show that elevated calpain, but not caspase-3, activity is a prominent feature of AD brain. In addition, we observe increased calpain-mediated cleavage of NCX3, but not a related family member NCX1, in AD brain relative to unaffected tissue and that from other neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, the extent of NCX3 proteolysis correlated significantly with amounts of AÎ²1-42. We also show that exposure of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric AÎ²1-42 results in calpain-dependent cleavage of NCX3, and we demonstrate that loss of NCX3 function is associated with AÎ² toxicity. Our findings suggest that AÎ² mediates calpain cleavage of NCX3 in AD brain and therefore that reduced NCX3 activity could contribute to the sustained increases in intraneuronal calcium concentrations that are associated with synaptic and neuronal dysfunction in AD.  
24292102	Changes of several brain receptor complexes in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer disease: probable new potential pharmaceutical targets.
Amino Acids 20131129 2014Jan
Although Alzheimer disease (AD) has been linked to defects in major brain receptors, studies thus far have been limited to the determination of receptor subunits or specific ligand binding studies. However, the availability of current technology enables the determination and quantification of brain receptor complexes. Thus, we examined levels of native receptor complexes in the brains of patients with AD. Cortical tissue was obtained from control subjects (n = 12 females and 12 males) and patients with AD (n = 12 females and 12 males) within a 3-h postmortem time period. The tissues were kept frozen until further biochemical analyses. Membrane proteins were extracted and subsequently enriched by ultracentrifugation using a sucrose gradient. Membrane proteins were then electrophoresed onto native gels and immunoblotted using antibodies against individual brain receptors. We found that the levels were comparable for complexes containing GluR2, GluR3 and GluR4 as well as 5-HT1A. Moreover, the levels of complexes containing muscarinic AChR M1, NR1 and GluR1 were significantly increased in male patients with AD. Nicotinic AChRs 4 and 7 as well as dopaminergic receptors D1 and D2 were also increased in males and females with AD. These findings reveal a pattern of altered receptor complex levels that may contribute to the deterioration of the concerted activity of these receptors and thus result in cognitive deficits observed in patients with AD. It should be emphasised that receptor complexes function as working units rather than individual subunits. Thus, the receptor deficits identified may be relevant for the design of experimental therapies. Therefore, specific pharmacological modulation of these receptors is within the pharmaceutical repertoire. 
24378397	A novel assay for high-throughput screening of anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs to determine their efficacy by real-time monitoring of changes in PC12 cell proliferation.
Int. J. Mol. Med. 20131227 2014Mar
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of senile plaque and neurofibrilary tangle formation in the brain, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Nowadays, the first-line treatment for AD is the application of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are basically anti-symptomatic for a limited aspect of AD pathology and are associated with serious side-effects. With the advantage of multiple targets, pathways and systems, Chinese herbal compounds hold promising potential for the development of drugs for the treatment of AD. Over the past few years, with the development of Chinese herbal compounds and in vitro pharmacological studies, cell-based disease models are one of the main methods used to screen Chinese herbal compounds for potential efficacy. Testing the efficacy of possible anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs and the development of new drugs are hindered by the lack of objective high-throughput screening methods. Currently, the assessment of the effects of drugs is usually made by MTT assays, involving laborious, subjective, low-throughput methods. Herein, we suggest a novel application for a real-time cell monitoring device (xCELLigence) that can simply and objectively assess the effective composition of Chinese herbal compounds by assessing amyloid-Î² peptide AÎ²1-42-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. We detected the proliferation and motility of the cells using a fully automated high-throughput and real-time system. We quantitatively assessed cell motility and determined the real-time IC50 values of various anti-AD drugs that intervene in several developmental stages of AÎ²1-42-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, Then, we identified the optimal time phase by curative efficacy. Our data indicate that this technique may aid in the discovery and development of novel anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs. It is possible to utilize a similar technique to measure changes in electrical impedance as cells attach and spread in a culture dish covered with a gold microelectrode array that covers approximately 80% of the area on the bottom of a well. As cells attach and spread on the electrode surface, it leads to an increase in electrical impedance of 9-12. The impedance is displayed as a dimensionless para-meter termed the cell index, which is directly proportional to the total area of tissue culture well that is covered by the cells. Hence, the cell index can be used to monitor cell adhesion, spreading, morphological variation and cell density. 
24139697	Circulating miR-125b as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20131009 2014Jan15
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs of 21-25 nucleotides that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expressions. Recently, circulating miRNAs have been reported as promising biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders and processes affecting the central nervous system. This study was conducted to investigate the potential role of serum miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Serum samples were obtained from 105 probable AD patients and 150 age- and gender-matched normal controls. The serum concentrations of miRNAs miR-9, miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-101, miR-125b, and miR-181c were measured with a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) method. We found both miR-125b and miR-181c were down-regulated while miR-9 was up-regulated in serum of AD patients compared with that of normal controls. Among the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) results, miR-125b alone showed its priority with a specificity up to 68.3% and a sensitivity of 80.8%. Importantly, miR-125b was correlated with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in AD patients. Our results indicate that serum miR-125b may serve as a useful noninvasive biomarker for AD. 
24139700	SIRT2 polymorphism rs10410544 is associated with Alzheimer's disease in a Han Chinese population.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20131010 2014Jan15
Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is a strong protein deacetylase, which is highly expressed in central nervous system. Recently, an association between SIRT2 rs10410544 polymorphism and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) was found in the APOEÎµ4-negative Caucasian population. To investigate the potential association between the rs10410544 C/T polymorphism of SIRT2 and the risk of LOAD, we conducted an independent replication case-control study in a Northern Han Chinese population comprising 1133 cases and 1159 healthy controls being matched for age and gender. The results revealed that there were significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between LOAD cases and controls (genotype P=0.008, allele P=0.009). When compared with the C allele, the T allele of rs10410544 demonstrated a 1.709-fold risk for developing LOAD. After stratification by apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4-carrying status, only APOEÎµ4 noncarriers (P=0.035, adjusted OR=1.656, 95% CI: 1.036-2.647) showed the relation between LOAD and SIRT2 rs10410544 T allele. This study provides the evidence that the rs10410544 C/T polymorphism of SIRT2 was associated with genetic susceptibility to LOAD in a Northern Han Chinese population.  
24189208	Pharmacological modulation of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
J. Neurol. Sci. 20131014 2014Jan15
To evaluate correlations of pharmacological treatment with cognitive and behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease with low schooling, subjects were assessed for demographic features, neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive decline, functionality, caregiver burden, APOE haplotypes and pharmacological treatment. Among 217 patients, use of cholinesterase inhibitors with or without Memantine was associated with less neuropsychiatric symptoms, while anti-psychotics and/or anti-epileptic drugs were associated with lower instrumental functionality. Anti-psychotics were also associated with more neuropsychiatric symptoms in moderately impaired patients, possibly reflecting the greater need for such treatment when behavioral symptoms are present. Patients receiving more medications were usually younger, obese, married, with higher schooling and more neuropsychiatric symptoms. APOE4+ haplotypes were correlated with earlier dementia onset, but not with pharmacological treatment. Higher caregiver burden was associated with more psychotropic drugs. A trend was found for treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and Memantine to be associated with longer lengths of dementia for moderately impaired but not for severely impaired patients, regardless of APOE haplotypes, translating into a synergistic effect among such medications for slowing cognitive decline but not for prolonging survival. Further longitudinal studies may be required to assess dose-response relationships regarding treatment with psychotropics for patients with dementia.  
24517102	Lesion of the subiculum reduces the spread of amyloid beta pathology to interconnected brain regions in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Neuropathol Commun 20140211 2014
The progressive development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology follows a spatiotemporal pattern in the human brain. In a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the arctic (E693G) mutation, pathology spreads along anatomically connected structures. Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) pathology first appears in the subiculum and is later detected in interconnected brain regions, including the retrosplenial cortex. We investigated whether the spatiotemporal pattern of AÎ² pathology in the Tg APP arctic mice to interconnected brain structures can be interrupted by destroying neurons using a neurotoxin and thereby disconnecting the neural circuitry. We performed partial unilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the subiculum (first structure affected by AÎ² pathology) in young Tg APParc mice, prior to the onset of pathology. We assessed AÎ²/C99 pathology in mice aged up to 6Â months after injecting ibotenate into the subiculum. Compared to the brains of intact Tg APP arctic mice, we observed significantly decreased AÎ²/C99 pathology in the ipsilateral dorsal subiculum, CA1 region of the hippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex; regions connecting to and from the dorsal subiculum. By contrast, AÎ²/C99 pathology was unchanged in the contralateral hippocampus in the mice with lesions. These results, obtained in an animal model of AD, support the notion that AÎ²/C99 pathology is transmitted between interconnected neurons in AD. 
24121960	Three-dimensional quantitative imaging of telomeres in buccal cells identifies mild, moderate, and severe Alzheimer's disease patients.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Using three-dimensional (3D) telomeric analysis of buccal cells of 82 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and cognitively normal age and gender-matched controls, we have for the first time examined changes in the 3D nuclear telomeric architecture of buccal cells among levels of AD severity based on five 3D parameters: i) telomere length, ii) telomere number, iii) telomere aggregation, iv) nuclear volume, and v) a/c ratio, a measure of spatial telomere distribution. Our data indicate that matched controls have significantly different 3D telomere profiles compared to mild, moderate, and severe AD patients (p &lt; 0.0001). Distinct profiles were also evident for each AD severity group. An increase in telomere number and aggregation concomitant with a decrease in telomere length from normal to severe AD defines the individual stages of the disease (p &lt; 0.0001).  
24121962	Distribution of pathology in frontal variant Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Atypical presentations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been described, including a "frontal" variant (fvAD), which presents with personality change and executive dysfunction similar to that seen in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). This clinical variation is thought to reflect the regional distribution of pathology, although few reports include autopsy confirmation. We compared three clinicopathological groups matched for age at diagnosis and disease duration; those with possible bvFTD who at autopsy had only AD (fvAD), those with typical AD clinically and pathologically, and those with typical clinical bvFTD confirmed pathologically. The density of neurons and AD-type pathology was quantified in the frontal association, occipital association, and entorhinal cortices and hippocampal CA1 regions. Immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated tau and amyloid-Î² deposition was used to detect neurofibrillary tangles and plaques. Of the six core clinical features of the International Consensus Criteria, disinhibition, stereotyped behaviors, and executive dysfunction were most common, occurring in five of the six fvAD patients. Other features were rare. While there was no significant difference in neuron density between groups for any of the four regions, when the ratio of frontal:occipital pathology was examined, neuronal density in fvAD was significantly less than AD but similar to bvFTD. The frontal:occipital ratio of AD-type pathology was also greater in fvAD than AD. The findings of this study suggest a frontal variant of AD exists with features that mimic bvFTD and that this reflects a differential distribution of neurodegeneration with more marked pathology in the frontal cortex compared with the occipital cortex.  
24121963	Corpus callosum shape and size changes in early Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal MRI study using the OASIS brain database.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been shown to be associated with shrinkage of the corpus callosum mid-sagittal cross-sectional area (CCA). To study temporal rates of corpus callosum atrophy not previously reported for early AD. We used longitudinal MRI scans to study the rates of change of CCA and circularity (CIR), a measure of its shape, in normal controls (NC, n = 75), patients with very mild AD (AD-VM, n = 51), and mild AD (AD-M, n = 21). There were significant reduction rates in CCA and CIR in all three groups. While CCA reduction rates were not statistically different between groups, the CIR declined faster in AD-VM (p &lt; 0.03) and AD-M (p &lt; 0.0001) relative to NC, and in AD-M relative to AD-VM (p &lt; 0.0004). CIR declines at an accelerated rate with AD severity. Its rate of change is more closely associated with AD progression than CCA or any of its sub-regions. CIR may be a useful group biomarker for objective assessment of treatments that aim to slow AD progression. 
24121964	Art therapy for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Patients with dementias commonly experience neuropsychiatric symptoms that diminish their quality of life. Pharmacologic treatments for these symptoms are limited in their efficacy. In the absence of near-future prospects for a cure for degenerative dementias, treatments that improve neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life are needed. We explore the hypothesis that art therapy is useful in dementia by reviewing the extant literature. With appropriate structure, patients with dementia can produce and appreciate visual art. Case studies and several small trials suggest that art therapy engages attention, provides pleasure, and improves neuropsychiatric symptoms, social behavior, and self-esteem. Whether these benefits generalize beyond the studio remains unknown. We offer a theoretical framework that motivates the use of art therapy and propose that clinical enquiry to establish methods, assess efficacy, and define optimal conditions for the use of art therapy in Alzheimer's and other dementing disorders is timely.  
24121967	Cerebral cortical microinfarcts at 7Tesla MRI in patients with early Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Cerebral microinfarcts (CMIs) are a common finding in neuropathological studies of aging and dementia. Recently, it has become possible to detect CMIs in vivo. We studied CMI occurrence in 29 patients with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 22 non-demented individuals on 7Tesla MRI. CMI occurrence in patients (55%) and controls (45%) was not significantly different. In patients, CMI number tended to be related to microbleed number (p = 0.07). This first in vivo study of CMIs in early AD does not confirm findings from autopsy studies. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of CMIs in AD.  
24121968	Neuropathology of parkinsonism in patients with pure Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
About one third of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients develop some parkinsonian features, yet half of them do not have Lewy body pathology at autopsy. The neuropathological substrate of parkinsonism in AD is still unclear. In the present study, we measured neuronal and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) densities in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) and in the putamen of 22 AD patients, 11 with and 11 without parkinsonism, here defined as the presence of bradykinesia and at least one of resting tremor, rigidity, or gait disorders. Our study showed that parkinsonism associated with AD was related to a significant loss of neurons both in the SN and in the putamen, suggesting pre-and postsynaptic alterations of the nigrostriatal pathway. Neuronal tau deposition was a less important factor as density of NFTs correlated with parkinsonism only in the SN but not in the putamen. We propose that a subgroup of pure AD patients develop parkinsonian symptoms as a result of neuronal loss in the basal ganglia, indicating a prominent subcortical involvement, which appears unrelated to the Braak stage of AD.  
24121969	Animal spotting in Alzheimer's disease: an eye tracking study of object categorization.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
We investigated rapid object categorization and, more specifically, the ability to detect a target object within a natural scene in people with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a saccadic choice task. It has been suggested that the anatomical pathway likely used to initiate rapid oculomotor responses in the saccadic choice task could involve the Frontal Eye Field, a structure that is part of the dorsal attentional network, in which connectivity is disrupted in AD. Seventeen patients with mild AD and 23 healthy age-matched controls took part in the study. A group of 24 young healthy observers was included as it has been reported that normal aging affects eye movements. Participants were presented with pairs of colored photographs of natural scenes, one containing an animal (the target) and one containing various objects (distracter), displayed for 1 s left and right of fixation. They were asked to saccade to the scene containing an animal. Neither pathology nor age affected temporal (saccade latencies and durations) and spatial (saccade amplitude) parameters of eye movements. Patients with AD were significantly less accurate than age-matched controls, and older participants were less accurate than young observers. The results are interpreted in terms of noisier sensory information and increased uncertainty in relation to deficits in the magnocellular pathway. The results suggest that, even at a mild stage of the pathology, people exhibit difficulties in selecting relevant objects.  
24145380	Beyond statistics: a new combinatorial approach to identifying biomarker panels for the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Interventions to delay or slow Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression are most effective when implemented at pre-clinical disease stages, making early diagnosis essential. For this reason, there is an increasing focus on discovery of predictive biomarkers for AD. Currently, the most reliable predictive biomarkers require either expensive (brain imaging) or invasive (cerebrospinal fluid collection) procedures, leading researchers to strive toward identifying robust biomarkers in blood. Yet promising early results from candidate blood biomarker studies are being refuted by subsequent findings in other cohorts or using different assay technologies. Recent evidence suggests that univariate blood biomarkers are not sufficiently sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of disorders as complex, multifactorial, and heterogeneous as AD. To overcome these present limitations, more consideration must be given to the development of 'biomarker panels' assessing multiple molecular entities. The selection of such panels should draw not only on traditional statistical approaches, whether parametric or non-parametric, but also on newer non-statistical approaches that have the capacity to retain and utilize information about all individual study participants rather than collapsing individual data into group summary values (e.g., mean, variance). These new approaches, facilitated by advances in computing, have the potential to preserve the context of interrelationships between different molecular entities, making them amenable to the development of panels that, as a multivariate collective, can overcome the challenge of individual variability and disease heterogeneity to accurately predict and classify AD. We argue that the AD research community should take fuller advantage of these approaches to accelerate discovery.  
24145382	1H NMR metabolomic signatures in five brain regions of the AÎ²PPswe Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease at four ages.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
In the quest for biomarkers of onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, a 1H NMR-based metabolomic study was performed on the simple single-transgenic Tg2576 mouse model. These mice develop a slow cognitive decline starting by 6 months and express amyloid plaques from 10 months of age. The metabolic profiles of extracts from five brain regions (frontal cortex, rhinal cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum) of Tg2576 male mice were compared to those of controls, at 1, 3, 6 and 11 months of age. The most obvious differences were due to brain regions. Age was also a discriminating parameter. Metabolic perturbations were already detected in the hippocampus and the rhinal cortex of transgenic mice as early as 1 month of age with decreased concentrations of glutamate (Glu) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) compared to those in wild-type animals. Metabolic changes were more numerous in the hippocampus and the rhinal cortex of 3 month-old transgenic mice and involved Glu, NAA, myo-inositol, creatine, phosphocholine, and Î³-aminobutyric acid (only in the hippocampus) whose concentrations decreased. A metabolic disruption characterized by an increase in the hippocampal concentrations of Glu, creatine, and taurine was detected in 6 month-old transgenic mice. At this time point, the chemical profile of the cerebellum was slightly affected. At 11 months, all the brain regions analyzed (except the frontal cortex) were metabolically altered, with mainly a marked increase in the formation of the neuroprotective metabolites creatine and taurine. Our findings demonstrate that metabolic modifications occur long before the onset of behavioral impairment.  
24150111	Autoimmune manifestations in the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer's disease.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014
Immune system activation is frequently reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unknown whether this is a cause, a consequence, or an epiphenomenon of brain degeneration. Objective: The present study examines whether immunological abnormalities occur in a well-established murine AD model and if so, how they relate temporally to behavioral deficits and neuropathology. A broad battery of tests was employed to assess behavioral performance and autoimmune/inflammatory markers in 3xTg-AD (AD) mice and wild type controls from 1.5 to 12 months of age. Aged AD mice displayed severe manifestations of systemic autoimmune/inflammatory dise6ase, as evidenced by splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, elevated serum levels of anti-nuclear/anti-dsDNA antibodies, low hematocrit, and increased number of double-negative T splenocytes. However, anxiety-related behavior and altered spleen function were evident as early as 2 months of age, thus preceding typical AD-like brain pathology. Moreover, AD mice showed altered olfaction and impaired "cognitive" flexibility in the first 6 months of life, suggesting mild cognitive impairment-like manifestations before general learning/memory impairments emerged at an older age. Interestingly, all of these features were present in 3xTg-AD mice prior to significant amyloid-Î² or tau pathology. The results indicate that behavioral deficits in AD mice develop in parallel with systemic autoimmune/inflammatory disease. These changes antedate AD-like neuropathology, thus supporting a causal link between autoimmunity and aberrant behavior. Consequently, 3xTg-AD mice may be a useful model in elucidating the role of immune system in the etiology of AD. 
24072346	Five-year follow-up of 11C-PIB uptake in Alzheimer's disease and MCI.
Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 20130927 2014Feb
The aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal changes in [(11)C]PIB uptake in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) over a long-term follow-up. Six AD patients, ten MCI patients and eight healthy subjects underwent a [(11)C]PIB PET scan at baseline and at 2 and 5 years. The clinical status of the MCI patients was evaluated every 6 months. The MCI group showed a significant increase in [(11)C]PIB uptake over time (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), with a similar increase from baseline to 2 years (4.7% per year) and from 2 to 5 years (5.0% per year). Eight MCI patients (80%) converted to AD, and two of these patients showed a normal [(11)C]PIB scan at baseline but increased uptake later. There was an increase in [(11)C]PIB uptake with time in the AD group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), but this did not significantly differ from the change in the control group. Our results revealed a significant increase in amyloid load even at the time of AD diagnosis in some of the MCI patients who converted. A positive [(11)C]PIB scan at baseline in MCI patients strongly predicted future conversion to AD but a negative PIB scan in MCI patients did not exclude future conversion. The results suggest that there is wide individual variation in the brain amyloid load in MCI, and in the course of amyloid accumulation in relation to the clinical diagnosis of AD. 
24085503	[18F]Flutemetamol amyloid-beta PET imaging compared with [11C]PIB across the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease.
Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 20131002 2014Feb
The aim was to identify the amyloid beta (AÎ²) deposition by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the (18)F-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) derivative [(18)F]flutemetamol (FMM) across a spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to compare AÎ² deposition between [(18)F]FMM and [(11)C]PIB PET imaging. The study included 36 patients with AD, 68 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 41 older healthy controls (HC) (aged â‰¥56), 11 young HC (aged â‰¤45), and 10 transitional HC (aged 46-55). All 166 subjects underwent 30-min static [(18)F]FMM PET 85 min after injection, 60-min dynamic [(11)C]PIB PET, and cognitive testing. [(18)F]FMM scans were assessed visually, and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were defined quantitatively in regions of interest identified on coregistered MRI (cerebellar cortex as a reference region). The PIB distribution volume ratios (DVR) were determined in the same regions. Of 36 AD patients, 35 had positive scans, while 36 of 41 older HC subjects had negative scans. [(18)F]FMM scans had a sensitivity of 97.2% and specificity of 85.3% in distinguishing AD patients from older HC subjects, and a specificity of 100% for young and transitional HC subjects. The [(11)C]PIB scan had the same results. Interreader agreement was excellent (kappa scoreâ€‰=â€‰0.81). The cortical FMM SUVR in AD patients was significantly greater than in older HC subjects (1.76â€‰Â±â€‰0.23 vs 1.30â€‰Â±â€‰0.26, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Of the MCI patients, 68 had a bimodal distribution of SUVR, and 29 of them (42.6%) had positive scans. Cortical FMM SUVR values were strongly correlated with PIB DVR (râ€‰=â€‰0.94, nâ€‰=â€‰145, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). [(18)F]FMM PET imaging detects AÎ² deposition in patients along the continuum from normal cognitive status to dementia of AD and discriminates AD patients from HC subjects, similar to [(11)C]PIB PET. 
23855502	The potential mechanisms of AÎ²-receptor for advanced glycation end-products interaction disrupting tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Neurosci. 20130815 2014Feb
The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multiligand membrane receptor that has been implicated in the cytotoxicity effects of Î²-amyloid protein (AÎ²) in AD. Positive feedback mechanism of RAGE within blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or cells inside the brain is proposed, including interaction with AÎ² stimulating activation of proinflammatory cytokines, release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to neuron damage and BBB dysfunction. RAGE is the main factor mediating AÎ² cytotoxicity. Attenuation of RAGE activity may inhibit AÎ² from accumulation in the cerebral blood vessels and prevent neurotoxicity. Furthermore, RAGE may serve as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting pathophysiological consequences of AÎ²-RAGE interaction. Tight junctions (TJ) are identified as the basic structure of the BBB and RAGE-mediated AÎ² cytotoxicity to the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), resulting in damaged BBB structural integrity. However, the potential mechanism is poorly studied.  
24332564	Pin1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and amyloid-Î² form a feedback signaling loop involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
Med. Hypotheses 20131128 2014Feb
Although the molecular mechanism has not yet been clarified until now, it is very interesting that Alzheimer's disease (AD), hypertension (HTN), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) often occur synchronously and possess many similar pathological characteristics. Herein, we hypothesize that a feedback signaling loop, consisted of Pin1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), may contribute to the interesting pathological phenomenon. First, Pin1 inhibits the production of AÎ², and enhances the activity of eNOS. Second, AÎ² and eNOS form a mutual inhibition system. Third, the well-balanced feedback signaling loop avoids the development of AD, HTN, and CAA by inhibiting the frequent pathological characteristics of these diseases, including AÎ² deposition in cerebral microvessels and cerebral microbleeds. On one hand, Pin1 and eNOS not only inhibit AÎ² production but also accelerate AÎ² clearance, preventing AÎ² deposition in cerebral microvessels. On the other hand, Pin1 and eNOS promote vasodilatation and prevent the elevation of blood pressure in brain, alleviating the pathology of cerebral microbleeds. However, once the precise balance is disturbed, it may result in AÎ² deposition, microbleeds, and elevated blood pressure, possibly leading to the synchronous occurrence of AD, HTN, and CAA. The hypothesis updates the current understanding of the molecular linkage among AD, HTN, and CAA, and lays the ground for developing combined prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these diseases more efficiently and more economically. Interestingly, biotechnical medicines enhancing the activity of Pin1 and/or eNOS may prevent the development of AD, HTN, and CAA, and targeting AÎ² deposition may alleviate the clinical pathologies of these related diseases. 
24490742	Modulation of inflammation in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease.
J Neuroinflammation 20140203 2014
Over the past decade the process of inflammation has been a focus of increasing interest in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field, not only for its potential role in neuronal degeneration but also as a promising therapeutic target. However, recent research in this field has provided divergent outcomes, largely due to the use of different models and different stages of the disease when the investigations have been carried out. It is now accepted that microglia, and possibly astrocytes, change their activation phenotype during ageing and the stage of the disease, and therefore these are important factors to have in mind to define the function of different inflammatory components as well as potential therapies. Modulating inflammation using animal models of AD has offered the possibility to investigate inflammatory components individually and manipulate inflammatory genes in amyloid precursor protein and tau transgenics independently. This has also offered some hints on the mechanisms by which these factors may affect AD pathology. In this review we examine the different transgenic approaches and treatments that have been reported to modulate inflammation using animal models of AD. These studies have provided evidence that enhancing inflammation is linked with increases in amyloid-beta (AÎ²) generation, AÎ² aggregation and tau phosphorylation. However, the alterations on tau phosphorylation can be independent of changes in AÎ² levels by these inflammatory mediators.  
24564121	[Study on early intervention of compound nutrition for cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease].
Wei Sheng Yan Jiu  2014Jan
To observe the early prevention effect of the compound nutrients recipe for cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer' s disease model-APP-PSN transgenic mouse. 36 APP-PSN transgenic mice aged two months randomly were divided into the intervention group supplied with compound recipe in the diet and the control group fed based feed, the former had high dose and low dose, 12 APP-PSN transgenic negative mice aged two months as the negative control were fed based feed. After 3 months' intervention, four groups' cognitive functions were evaluated using the Morris water maze, active avoidance experiment and jumping stair experiment. There was not statistically different between all the four groups for the weight and food intake. Compared with the control group, Morris water maze's incubation period of the intervention group was lower obviously, and jumping stair experiment's incubation period of the intervention group was higher obviously. In the active avoidance experiment, the high and low dose intervention group' s conditioned response accounted about 46.67% and 45.00% respectively, and the control group's conditioned response accounted about 20.83%. The differences of the three behavioral experiments between control group and intervention group had the statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05), so the same as between control group and negative control group (P &lt; 0.05). And there was no difference between intervention group and negative control group for the three behavioral experiments. The early supplementation with compound nutrition could postpone the occurrence and development of Alzheimer' s disease mice model's cognitive dysfunction. 
24075291	The Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment screen correlated with the Standardized Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section in clinical trials.
J Clin Epidemiol 20130925 2014Jan
The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section and its standardized version (SADAS-cog) are the current standard for assessing cognitive outcomes in clinical trials of dementia. This study compares a shorter cognitive instrument, the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen, with the SADAS-cog as outcome measures in clinical trials. The SADAS-cog, Qmci, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and the Lawton-Brady activities of daily living (ADL) scale were assessed at multiple time points, over 1 year in a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 406 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia. Correlations were estimated using regression at each time point, all time points, and mean values across time. Responsiveness was assessed using the standardized response mean (SRM). Regression for pooled time points showed strong and significant correlation between the SADAS-cog and Qmci (r = -0.75, P &lt; 0.001). Correlations remained strong for mean values across time and at each time point. The SADAS-cog and Qmci also correlated with CDR and ADL scores. There was no difference in SRMs between the SADAS-cog and Qmci [t(357) = -0.32, P = 0.75]. The Qmci correlated strongly with the SADAS-cog and both were equally responsive to deterioration. We suggest that clinicians and investigators can substitute the shorter Qmci for the SADAS-cog. 
24105258	Biomarker-driven therapeutic management of Alzheimer's disease: establishing the foundations.
Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 20131008 2014Jan
Biomarkers are characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Amyloid measures become abnormal early in the Alzheimer's disease process and have only weak correlations with disease progression and cognitive decline; cerebrospinal fluid tau, brain atrophy, and reduced cortical metabolism correlate with cognitive measures and disease progression. Combinations of biomarkers have higher correlations and are better predictors of future decline than single biomarkers. Current biomarkers do not account for all of the variance in Alzheimer's disease; a more complete repertoire of biomarkers that more comprehensively assay the disease process is needed. 
24360558	Synthesis of long-chain fatty acid derivatives as a novel anti-Alzheimer's agent.
Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 20131209 2014Jan15
In order to develop new drugs for Alzheimer's disease, we prepared 17 fatty acid derivatives with different chain lengths and different numbers and positions of double bonds by using Wittig reaction and stereospecific hydrogenation of triple bonds as key reactions. Among them, (4Z,15Z)-octadecadienoic acid (10) and (23Z,34Z)-heptatriacontadienoic acid (16) showed the most potent neurite outgrowth activities on AÎ²(25-35)-treated rat cortical neurons, which activities were comparable to that of a positive control, NGF. Both fatty acids 10 and 16 possess two (Z)-double bonds at the n-3 and n-14 positions, which might be important for the neurite outgrowth activity.  
24156257	The effects of different antioxidants on the activity of cerebrocortical MnSOD and Na,K-ATPase from post mortem Alzheimer's disease and age-matched normal brains.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Jan
Among the markers and targets of the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis MnSOD (mitochondrial dysfunction) and Na-pump (disturbances in function/regulation) are often highlighted. This paper focused on comparison of the effects of three antioxidants on the activity of cerebrocortical MnSOD and Na,K-ATPase from post mortem Alzheimer's disease and age-matched normal brains. Antioxidant compounds with different origins: natural glutathione, synthetic UPF peptides (glutathione analogues) and phytoestrogen genistein were investigated. Firstly, MnSOD and Na,K-ATPase activities were found to be decreased in the post mortem AD brains compared with age-matched controls. Secondly, GSH had no effect on MnSOD activity, but decreased Na,K-ATPase activity both in the control and AD brains. Thirdly, UPF1 and UPF17 increased MnSOD activity, and UPF17 suppressed Na,K-ATPase activity. Further studies are needed to clarify, if the inhibitory effect of UPF17 on Na,K-ATPase could abolish the beneficial effect gained from MnSOD activation. Both the antioxidative potential of genistein and its potency to up-regulate Na,K-ATPase activity make it an attractive candidate substance to suppress the early phase of the pathogenesis of AD.  
24156260	Pan-amyloid oligomer specific scFv antibody attenuates memory deficits and brain amyloid burden in mice with Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Jan
Amyloid oligomers have a critical function in the pathologic processes of various amyloidoses, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington's disease, prion-related diseases, type 2 diabetes, and hereditary renal amyloidosis. Our previous reports demonstrated that a conformation-dependent oligomer-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, W20, isolated from a naÃ¯ve human scFv library, can recognize oligomers assembled from Î±-synuclein, amylin, insulin, AÎ²40/42, prion peptide 106-126, and lysozyme, inhibit the aggregation of various amyloid, and attenuate amyloid oligomer-induced cytotoxicity In vitro. Furthermore, W20 recognized the amyloid oligomers in all types of plaques, Lewy bodies, and amylin deposits in the brain tissues of AD and PD patients and in the pancreas of type 2 diabetes patients. In the current study, we showed that W20 blocked the binding of AÎ² oligomers to SH-SY5Y cells, did not bind to heat shock protein, rescued cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and interfered with AÎ² levels and deposits in mouse brain. These results suggest that W20 may be a promising therapeutic for the treatment of AD.  
24156266	Pathological reorganization of NMDA receptors subunits and postsynaptic protein PSD-95 distribution in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Jan
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), synaptic alterations play a major role and are often correlated with cognitive changes. In order to better understand synaptic modifications, we compared alterations in NMDA receptors and postsynaptic protein PSD-95 expression in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and frontal cortex (FC; area 9) of AD and control brains. We combined immunohistochemical and image analysis methods to quantify on consecutive sections the distribution of PSD-95 and NMDA receptors GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B in EC and FC from 25 AD and control cases. The density of stained receptors was analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to assess the effect of neurodegeneration. In both regions, the number of neuronal profiles immunostained for GluN1 receptors subunit and PSD-95 protein was significantly increased in AD compared to controls (3-6 fold), while the number of neuronal profiles stained for GluN2A and GluN2B receptors subunits was on the contrary decreased (3-4 fold). The increase in marked neuronal profiles was more prominent in a cortical band corresponding to layers 3 to 5 with large pyramidal cells. Neurons positive for GluN1 or PSD-95 staining were often found in the same localization on consecutive sections and they were also reactive for the anti-tau antibody AD2, indicating a neurodegenerative process. Differences in the density of immunoreactive puncta representing neuropile were not statistically significant. Altogether these data indicate that GluN1 and PSD-95 accumulate in the neuronal perikarya, but this is not the case for GluN2A and GluN2B, while the neuropile compartment is less subject to modifications. Thus, important variations in the pattern of distribution of the NMDA receptors subunits and PSD-95 represent a marker in AD and by impairing the neuronal network, contribute to functional deterioration.  
24251391	Cerebrovascular pathology and amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Jan
Accumulation, aggregation and deposition of the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides in the brain are widely accepted as the central events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Any factor that is capable of causing these events is potentially a risk factor for AD. In the last decade, evidence has accumulated to support the association between cerebral vascular diseases (CVD) and AD. CVD is known to induce amyloid deposition and affects the age of onset for sporadic AD; whereas, amyloid deposition has been shown to cause cerebrovascular degeneration. In this review, we propose a positive feedback loop between CVD and amyloid deposition. The disease cycle could be triggered by aging and/or other environmental factor-associated CVD, as in late-onset sporadic AD patients, or by over production of AÎ², as in the familial AD patients and amyloid precursor protein transgenic animals.  
24251392	Impaired cerebral autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Jan
Understanding the relationship between vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD) will enhance our insight into this disease and pave the way for novel therapeutic research. Cerebrovascular dysfunction, expressed as impaired cerebral autoregulation and cerebral vasomotor reactivity, has been observed in transgenic mouse models for AD. Translation to human AD is limited and conflicting however. To investigate if impaired cerebral autoregulation and cerebral vasomotor reactivity, found in animal models for AD, are present in human sporadic AD. In 12 patients with mild to moderate AD (75 SD 4 yr) and 24 controls matched for age and history of hypertension, all without diabetes, we measured blood pressure (Finapres) and cerebral blood flow-velocity (transcranial Doppler). Cerebral autoregulation was assessed during changes in blood pressure induced by single and repeated sit-stand maneuvers. Cerebral vasomotor reactivity was assessed during hyperventilation and inhalation of 5 % carbon dioxide. During single sit-stands, controls had a 4% (SD 8) decrease in cerebrovascular resistance during a reduction in blood pressure, and an 8 % (SD 11) increase during a rise in blood pressure, indicating normal cerebral autoregulation. These changes were not seen in AD (p=0.04). During repeated sit-stands, blood pressure fluctuated by 20 % of baseline. This led to larger fluctuations in cerebral blood flow in AD (27 (6) %) than in controls (22 (6) %, p &lt; 0.05). Cerebral vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was reduced in AD (42.7 % increase in CBFV, versus 79.5 % in controls, p = 0.03). Observations of impaired cerebrovascular function (impaired autoregulation and vasoreactivity) in transgenic mouse models for AD were confirmed in patients with sporadic AD. 
24251393	Molecular links between endothelial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive decline of cognitive functions and represents the most common form of dementia and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the modern, westernized societies. There is accumulating evidence to support the hypothesis that a primary cerebral vascular dysfunction initiates a cascade of events that lead to neuronal injury in Alzheimer's dementia. The endothelium, in specific, constitutes a part of the blood brain barrier, the dysfunction of which is thought to play an important role to disturbed amyloid-Î² homeostasis and infiltration of the brain parenchyma with circulating toxic molecules in the disease. Furthermore, the endothelium itself is under certain conditions capable of producing neurotoxic and inflammatory factors, whereas common growth factors regulate the development and maintenance of both neurons and blood vessels. Reliance of both endothelial and neuronal cells on mitochondrial integrity and common molecular pathways for apoptosis also imply that there is a link between vascular pathology and neurodegeneration. The present article intends to review available evidence on molecular players implicated in the above mechanisms with the potential to develop biomarkers or novel therapeutic targets.  
24251394	Dysregulation of neurotrophic and haematopoietic growth factors in Alzheimer's disease: from pathophysiology to novel treatment strategies.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Growth factors have been demonstrated to act in a synergistic way in angiogenesis and neurogenesis contributing to self-healing powers of the adult human brain. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that levels of many growth factors (neurotrophins and hematopoietins) are altered in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood from AD patients and in animal models of AD. The present review summarizes the role of several neurotrophic growth factors (e.g., BDNF, SCF, NGF, GDNF) and haematopoietic growth factors (e.g., G-CSF, VEGF, SDF-1) in AD. Moreover, we summarize recent studies evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic value of growth factor levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with AD and discuss the potential role of these growth factors as a promising new therapeutic approach in AD.  
24359500	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week study of the H3 receptor antagonist, GSK239512 as a monotherapy in subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
Curr Alzheimer Res  2014Jan
Histaminergic H3 receptors may play a role in modulating cholinergic and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This Phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of GSK239512, a highly potent, brain penetrant H3 receptor antagonist as monotherapy treatment for subjects with mild-to-moderate probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this 16-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group study, 196 currently untreated subjects with mild-tomoderate AD (Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] 16-24) received GSK239512 (n=97); or placebo (n=99) administered orally each morning. After a two-week placebo run-in period GSK239512 was up-titrated over 4 weeks in a flexible manner (10-20-40-80 microgram [Âµg]) followed by a 12-week Maintenance Phase. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in Episodic Memory and Executive Function/Working Memory composite scores from the CogState neuropsychological test battery (NTB) at Week 16. Compared to placebo, GSK239512 improved Episodic Memory at Week 16 (Effect Size [ES] =0.35; p=0.0495). No statistically significant differences were observed on other cognitive domains or on clinical measures including the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADASCog). GSK239512 treatment was associated with mild to moderate adverse events with headache, dizziness and events related to sleep disturbances being the most common and more pronounced in the early titration period when subjects were first being exposed to GSK239512 at the lower 10Âµg and 20Âµg doses. There were no clinically relevant changes in other safety parameters. GSK239512, at doses up to 80Âµg/day, improved Episodic Memory in patients with mildto- moderate AD. However, no improvements were observed on Executive Function/Working Memory or other domains of cognition. No changes were observed on any of the clinical measures included as secondary endpoints (including ADAS-Cog) indicating that GSK239512 failed to show benefit in this population. GSK239512 had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. These findings suggest that H3 antagonists may, at most, have modest and selective effects on cognitive function in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. 
24101602	Altered CpG methylation in sporadic Alzheimer's disease is associated with APP and MAPT dysregulation.
Hum. Mol. Genet. 20130918 2014Feb1
The hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is an accumulation of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) and phosphorylated tau, which are encoded by the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) genes, respectively. Less than 5% of all AD cases are familial in nature, i.e. caused by mutations in APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2. Almost all mutations found in them are related to an overproduction of AÎ²1-42, which is prone to aggregation. While these genes are mutation free, their function, or those of related genes, could be compromised in sporadic AD as well. In this study, pyrosequencing analysis of post-mortem brains revealed aberrant CpG methylation in APP, MAPT and GSK3B genes of the AD brain. These changes were further evaluated by a newly developed in vitro-specific DNA methylation system, which in turn highlighted an enhanced expression of APP and MAPT. Cell nucleus sorting of post-mortem brains revealed that the methylation changes of APP and MAPT occurred in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, whereas GSK3B was abnormally methylated in non-neuronal cells. Further analysis revealed an association between abnormal APP CpG methylation and apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele (APOE Îµ4)-negative cases. The presence of a small number of highly methylated neurons among normal neurons contribute to the methylation difference in APP and MAPT CpGs, thus abnormally methylated cells could compromise the neural circuit and/or serve as 'seed cells' for abnormal protein propagation. Our results provide a link between familial AD genes and sporadic neuropathology, thus emphasizing an epigenetic pathomechanism for sporadic AD.  
24309291	Association between the SORL1 rs2070045 polymorphism and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: interaction with the ApoE genotype in the Chinese Han population.
Neurosci. Lett. 20131203 2014Jan24
Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is a common neurodegenerative disease [1], and the two well identified pathological hallmarks of LOAD are senile plaques formed from amyloid Î² peptides (AÎ²) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of hyperphorylated tau protein [2]. The neuronal Sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) is involved in the processing and trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into recycling pathways, thus influencing AÎ² generation and by this AD pathology [3]. To explore the relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the SORL1 SNP 19 rs2070045 and LOAD, a case-control study was conducted in a Chinese Han cohort including 77 LOAD patients and 100 control participants. This SNP 19 rs2070045 was genotyped with a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, (PCR-RFLP) method. The association was revealed between the polymorphism of SNP 19 rs2070045 (T/T, T/G, G/G) and the risk of LOAD. The results of this study indicated that the T allele (T/G+T/T) of SNP 19 rs2070045 was successful in exerting obvious influence in LOAD patients (Ï‡(2)=4.884, P=0.027&lt;0.05). However, there is no sufficient evidence to prove that the T allele of SNP 19 rs2070045 is associated with É›4 allele of ApoE gene in LOAD patients (Ï‡(2)=0.771, P=0.380&gt;0.05).  
24416143	Hierarchical interactions model for predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) conversion.
PLoS ONE 20140108 2014
Identifying patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who are likely to convert to dementia has recently attracted increasing attention in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. An accurate prediction of conversion from MCI to AD can aid clinicians to initiate treatments at early stage and monitor their effectiveness. However, existing prediction systems based on the original biosignatures are not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose to fit the prediction models using pairwise biosignature interactions, thus capturing higher-order relationship among biosignatures. Specifically, we employ hierarchical constraints and sparsity regularization to prune the high-dimensional input features. Based on the significant biosignatures and underlying interactions identified, we build classifiers to predict the conversion probability based on the selected features. We further analyze the underlying interaction effects of different biosignatures based on the so-called stable expectation scores. We have used 293 MCI subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database that have MRI measurements at the baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method achieves better classification performance than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we discover several significant interactions predictive of MCI-to-AD conversion. These results shed light on improving the prediction performance using interaction features.  
24287417	On-chip magneto-immunoassay for Alzheimer's biomarker electrochemical detection by using quantum dots as labels.
Biosens Bioelectron 20131107 2014Apr15
Electrochemical detection of cadmium-selenide/zinc-sulfide (CdSe@ZnS) quantum dots (QDs) as labeling carriers in an assay for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) detection has been evaluated. The immunocomplex was performed by using tosylactivated magnetic beads as preconcentration platform into a flexible hybrid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-polycarbonate (PC) microfluidic chip with integrated screen printed electrodes (SPE). All the immunoassay was performed in chip and in flow mode. The sensitive electrochemical detection was obtained by square wave anodic stripping voltammetry. ApoE was evaluated for its potential as biomarker for Alzheimer's disease detection, achieving a limit of detection (LOD) of ~12.5 ng mL(-1) with a linear range from 10 to 200 ng mL(-1) and high accuracy for diluted human plasma. 
23125121	Ventromedial-frontopolar prefrontal cortex atrophy correlates with insight loss in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Hum Brain Mapp 20121105 2014Feb
Loss in insight is a major feature of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) but has been investigated relatively little. More importantly, the neural basis of insight loss is still poorly understood. The current study investigated insight deficit profiles across a large cohort of neurodegenerative patients (n = 81), including FTD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We employed a novel insight questionnaire, which tapped into changes across different domains: social interaction, emotion, diagnosis/treatment, language, and motivation. FTD subtypes varied considerably for insight loss, with the behavioral variant worst and the progressive non-fluent variant least affected. All other subtypes and AD showed milder but consistent insight loss. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that overall insight loss correlated with ventromedial and frontopolar prefrontal atrophy, with exception of social interaction and emotion insight loss, which additionally correlated with lateral temporal and amygdala atrophy, respectively. Our results show that patients with neurodegenerative conditions show variable loss of insight, with ventromedial and frontopolar cortex regions appearing to be particularly important for insight. 
24423188	Lack of association between cathepsin D C224T polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease risk: an update meta-analysis.
BMC Neurol 20140115 2014
Cathepsin D C224T polymorphism has been reported to associate with AD susceptibility. But the results were inconsistent. This study aimed to assess the relationship between C224T polymorphism and AD risk. The relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Wan fang electronic databases updated on July 2013. The relationship between Cathepsin D C224T polymorphism and AD risk was evaluated by ORs and 95% CIs. A total of 25 case-control studies including 5,602 cases and 11,049 controls were included in the meta-analysis. There was no association between C224T polymorphism and AD risk with all the studies were pooled in the meta-analysis (CT vs. CC: OR = 1.125, 95% CI = 0.974-1.299, P = 0.109; CT + TT vs. CC: OR = 1.136, 95% CI = 0.978-1.320, P = 0.094). Furthermore, when stratified by ethnicity, age of onset and APOEÏµ4 status, significant association did not found in all subgroups. The present meta-analysis suggested that the Cathepsin D C224T polymorphism was not associated with AD susceptibility. 
24550773	Increased microRNA-34c abundance in Alzheimer's disease circulating blood plasma.
Front Mol Neurosci 20140204 2014
Circulating microRNAs, present either in the cellular component, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), or in cell-free plasma, have emerged as biomarkers for age-dependent systemic, disease-associated changes in many organs. Previously, we have shown that microRNA (miR)-34a is increased in circulating PBMC of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the present study, we show that this microRNA's sister, miR-34c, exhibits even greater increase in both cellular and plasma components of AD circulating blood samples, compared to normal age-matched controls. Statistical analysis shows the accuracy of levels of miR-34c assayed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis: the area under the curve is 0.99 (p &lt; 0.0001) and the 95% confidence level extends from 0.97 to 1. Pearson correlation between miR-34c levels and mild and moderate AD, as defined by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), shows an r-value of -0.7, suggesting a relatively strong inverse relationship between the two parameters. These data show that plasma levels of microRNA 34c are much more prominent in AD than those of its sister, miR-34a, or than its own level in PBMC. Transfection studies show that miR-34c, as does its sister miR-34a, represses the expression of several selected genes involved in cell survival and oxidative defense pathways, such as Bcl2, SIRT1, and others, in cultured cells. Taken together, our results indicate that increased levels of miR-34c in both PBMC and plasma may reflect changes in circulating blood samples in AD patients, compared to age-matched normal controls.  
24551475	Spectral Analysis of EEG in Familial Alzheimer's Disease with E280A Presenilin-1 Mutation Gene.
Int J Alzheimers Dis 20140102 2014
To evaluate the hypothesis that quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis is susceptible to detect early functional changes in familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) preclinical stages. Three groups of subjects were selected from five extended families with hereditary AD: a Probable AD group (18 subjects), an asymptomatic carrier (ACr) group (21 subjects), with the mutation but without any clinical symptoms of dementia, and a normal group of 18 healthy subjects. In order to reveal significant differences in the spectral parameter, the Mahalanobis distance (D (2)) was calculated between groups. To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of this statistic D (2), the ROC models were used. The ROC curve was summarized by accuracy index and standard deviation. The D (2) using the parameters of the energy in the fast frequency bands shows accurate discrimination between normal and ACr groups (area ROC = 0.89) and between AD probable and ACr groups (area ROC = 0.91). This is more significant in temporal regions. Theses parameters could be affected before the onset of the disease, even when cognitive disturbance is not clinically evident. Spectral EEG parameter could be firstly used to evaluate subjects with E280A Presenilin-1 mutation without impairment in cognitive function.  
23617556	Impact of ambulatory physiotherapy on motor abilities of elderly subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
Geriatr Gerontol Int 20130425 2014Jan
We investigated the impact of ambulatory physiotherapy (AP) on motor abilities in elderly subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects with mild to moderate AD were included and divided into "physiotherapy group" (PG) and "no physiotherapy group" (NPG) according to whether or not they received AP between inclusion (T0) and the second time of assessment, between 15 and 36â€‰months after inclusion (T1). The follow-up duration, Mini-Mental State Examination, Tinetti and mini motor test (MMT) scores, Timed Up &amp; Go test (TUG), gait speed (GS), one-leg balance (OLB), history of falls within the last 6â€‰months (HF), ability to rise from the floor (RFF) and the use of a walking aid (UWA) were recorded at T0, and after at least 15â€‰months of follow up (T1). A total of 50 subjects were included in the NPG and 20 in the PG. At baseline, these groups were not significantly different for all the parameters recorded. The anova showed a progression of cognitive disorders in the two groups between T0 and T1 (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), which was similar in the two groups (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.83). For each postural and motor quantitative test (Tinetti, MMT, TUG, GS) the anova showed a main effect of time of assessment (All Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) associated with a groupâ€‰Ã—â€‰time of assessment interaction (All Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05). The comparison between the two groups with regard to the evolution of qualitative parameters showed a significant difference for the OLB test only. No significant difference was found for RFF, HF and UWA. There was a significant improvement or stability of motor abilities in the PG; while these abilities decreased in the NPG. 
23567444	Severity of dementia, anosognosia, and depression in relation to the quality of life of patients with Alzheimer disease: discrepancies between patients and caregivers.
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130109 2014Feb
To investigate the factors associated with discrepancies between patient and caregiver reports of the quality of life of patients (QoLp) with Alzheimer disease. Cross-sectional analytic study of 141 patients and their caregivers. The instruments used were the Quality of Life in AD, the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Anosognosia Questionnaire-Dementia. Differences were analyzed according to GDS stage. A linear regression analysis was conducted using the difference between the absolute QoLp scores of patients and caregivers. A cluster analysis involving patient variables was then performed. The discrepancy between patient and caregiver QoLp ratings increased in line with GDS stages (Ï‡(2) (2)Â = 8.7, pÂ = 0.013). In the regression model (F [7,133]Â = 16.6, pÂ &lt;0.001; R(2)Â =Â 0.477), discrepancies in QoLp reports were associated with greater anosognosia, less depression, and a better cognitive status in patients and with female gender among caregivers. The cluster analysis showed that patients with the lowest ratings of QoLp had a better cognitive status, more depression, and less anosognosia. Conversely, the highest ratings were given by patients with a poorer cognitive status, less depression, and greater anosognosia. The factors associated with greater discrepancies between patient and caregiver ratings of QoLp were severity of dementia, anosognosia, depression, and cognitive status in patients and female gender in caregivers. In patients with advanced dementia, greater anosognosia leads to more positive ratings in QoLp and complementary observations are required. 
23567445	Subtypes of sleep problems in patients with Alzheimer disease.
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130111 2014Feb
Sleep disturbances are common in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and can contribute to cognitive dysfunction and a negative impact on patients' and caregivers' quality of life. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether subtypes of sleep disturbance could be identified in patients with AD and to assess the relation of these subtypes to patient characteristics and caregiver mood. As part of routine clinical assessment, primary caregivers of 344 patients with AD completed a questionnaire that included five items about the patients' sleep. Patients' cognitive and functional status and their mood were assessed as was caregivers' mood. Latent class analysis was used to define subgroups of patients based on their sleep patterns. After identification of groups of sleep disturbance, the relation of group membership to patient and caregiver characteristics was also evaluated. Analyses revealed groups with moderate and severe sleep problems as well as a group without problems. Patients with more severe sleep disturbance were older, less well educated, and had poorer cognitive and functional status. Caregiver and patient depression was related to membership in the severe group, suggesting that both may contribute to caregivers' ratings of more severe sleep disturbance, whereas only patient depression was related to membership in the moderate group. Sleep problems in patients with AD are related to poorer cognitive and functional status and patient and caregiver depression. Caregiver depression was most closely related to more severe patient sleep disturbance. 
24268581	Whole cortical and default mode network mean functional connectivity as potential biomarkers for mild Alzheimer's disease.
Psychiatry Res 20131111 2014Jan30
The search for an Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker is one of the most relevant contemporary research topics due to the high prevalence and social costs of the disease. Functional connectivity (FC) of the default mode network (DMN) is a plausible candidate for such a biomarker. We evaluated 22 patients with mild AD and 26 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. All subjects underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a 3.0 T scanner. To identify the DMN, seed-based FC of the posterior cingulate was calculated. We also measured the sensitivity/specificity of the method, and verified a correlation with cognitive performance. We found a significant difference between patients with mild AD and controls in average z-scores: DMN, whole cortical positive (WCP) and absolute values. DMN individual values showed a sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 70%. DMN and WCP values were correlated to global cognition and episodic memory performance. We showed that individual measures of DMN connectivity could be considered a promising method to differentiate AD, even at an early phase, from normal aging. Further studies with larger numbers of participants, as well as validation of normal values, are needed for more definitive conclusions. 
24296273	Depressive symptoms and regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease.
Psychiatry Res 20131115 2014Jan30
Depressive symptoms are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increase the caregiver burden, although the etiology and pathologic mechanism of depressive symptoms in AD patients remain unclear. In this study, we tried to clarify the cerebral blood flow (CBF) correlates of depressive symptoms in AD, excluding the effect of apathy and anxiety. Seventy-nine consecutive patients with AD were recruited from outpatient units of the Memory Clinic of Okayama University Hospital. The level of depressive symptoms was evaluated using the depression domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The patients underwent brain SPECT with 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer. After removing the effects of age, anxiety and apathy scores of NPI, and five subscales of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-revised (ACE-R), correlation analysis of NPI depression scores showed a significant cluster of voxels in the left middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 9), similar to the areas in the simple correlation analysis. The dorsolateral prefrontal area is significantly involved in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms in AD, and the area on the left side especially may be closely related to the depressive symptoms revealed by NPI.  
23908553	Total body 100-mGy X-irradiation does not induce Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis or memory impairment in mice.
J. Radiat. Res. 20130801 2014Jan1
The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. Possible cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from various sources. Early transcriptional response in murine brain to low-dose X-rays (100 mGy) has been reported, suggesting alterations of molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and AD. To investigate acute and late transcriptional, pathological and cognitive consequences of low-dose radiation, we applied an acute dose of 100-mGy total body irradiation (TBI) with X-rays to C57BL/6J Jms mice. We collected hippocampi and analyzed expression of 84 AD-related genes. Mouse learning ability and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze test. We performed in vivo PET scans with (11)C-PIB, a radiolabeled ligand for amyloid imaging, to detect fibrillary amyloid beta peptide (AÎ²) accumulation, and examined characteristic AD pathologies with immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein (APP), AÎ², tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). mRNA studies showed significant downregulation of only two of 84 AD-related genes, Apbb1 and Lrp1, at 4 h after irradiation, and of only one gene, Il1Î±, at 1 year after irradiation. Spatial learning ability and memory were not significantly affected at 1 or 2 years after irradiation. No induction of amyloid fibrillogenesis or changes in APP, AÎ², tau, or p-tau expression was detected at 4 months or 2 years after irradiation. TBI induced early or late transcriptional alteration in only a few AD-related genes but did not significantly affect spatial learning, memory or AD-like pathological change in mice.  
24038346	Extracellular amyloid beta 42 causes necrosis, inhibition of nuclear division, and mitotic disruption under both folate deficient and folate replete conditions as measured by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay.
Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 20130828 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease is associated with accumulation of extracellular beta amyloid peptide 42 (AÎ²42) which may induce DNA damage and reduce cellular regenerative potential. These effects may be exacerbated under conditions of folate deficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate whether extracellular AÎ²42 induces DNA damage and cell death in human peripheral lymphocytes and whether there is an interactive effect between extracellular AÎ²42 and folic acid status. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in medium under conditions of both low and high folate (20 and 200 nM, respectively) and challenged with either AÎ²42 or the physiologically normal form AÎ²40 (both at 5, 10, 15 ÂµM). Genome stability and cytotoxicity events were investigated using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay. Outcome measures scored included the nuclear division index (NDI), necrosis, apoptosis, binucleated cells with micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), and nuclear buds (NBUD) and abnormally shaped nuclei (circular, (CIR) and horse-shoe, (HS) that may be indicative of mitotic disruption. Folic acid deficiency significantly reduced NDI (P &lt; 0.001) and increased all the DNA damage biomarkers (MN, NPB, NBUD, HS, CIR), (P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, exposure to AÎ²40 had no impact on CBMN cytome biomarkers but AÎ²42 significantly reduced NDI (P &lt; 0.01), increased necrosis (P &lt; 0.05) and frequency of cells with circular nuclei (P &lt; 0.01). There was no evidence of an interaction between AÎ²42 and folic acid with respect to CBMN cytome biomarkers. Extracellular AÎ²42 appears to have cytotoxic and cytostatic effects but its effect on chromosomal instability appears to be small relative to folate deficiency. 
24310227	Design, synthesis and evaluation of novel tacrine-rhein hybrids as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Org. Biomol. Chem. 20131206 2014Feb7
A series of tacrine-rhein hybrid compounds have been designed and synthesized as novel multifunctional potent ChE inhibitors. Most of the compounds inhibited ChEs in the nanomolar range in vitro effectively. Compound 10b was one of the most potent inhibitors and was 5-fold more active than tacrine toward AChE, and it also showed a moderate BuChE inhibition with an IC50 value of 200 nM. Kinetic and molecular modeling studies of 10b also indicated that it was a mixed-type inhibitor binding simultaneously to the active and peripheral sites of AChE. In inhibition of the AChE-induced AÎ² aggregation assay, compound 10b (70.2% at 100 Î¼M) showed the greatest inhibitory activity. In addition, 10b showed metal-chelating property and low hepatotoxicity. These results suggested that 10b might be an excellent multifunctional agent for AD treatment.  
24381043	The War (on Terror) on Alzheimer's.
Dementia (London) 20120702 2014Jan
In the decade following the tragedies of 9/11, a US-led "War on Terror" has coincided with a US-led "War on Alzheimer's disease". Not only has the rhetoric from these two wars overlapped and produced similar practical and conceptual problems, the campaigns have also become interwoven through the emerging public health issue of war-related head injuries, as well as a shared neglect for environmental contributions to human suffering. This article first explores similarities in the framing and prosecution of both wars, and then considers the long-term consequences of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and traumatic environmental injuries (TEI) in the context of a society facing the increased prevalence of dementia. Ultimately, it is argued that addressing the challenges of cognitive aging and preventing violent social conflict both require a vernacular of higher ideals and values--as well as new language patterns rising out of the ecological movement--to trump the more expedient war rhetoric that has disproportionately marked public discourse around terrorism and Alzheimer's disease during the past decade. 
23992456	Positive and negative effects of prostaglandins in Alzheimer's disease.
Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 20130902 2014Jan
The aim of this review was to clarify the role of prostaglandins and prostaglandin receptors in the immunopathology of Alzheimer's disease. A PubMed search was done using the key word, 'Alzheimer's disease' in combination with the term 'prostaglandins'. Articles from the past 10 years were preferentially selected but important ones from the past 20 years were also included according to the authors' judgment. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by pathological hallmarks such as extracellular deposition of the amyloid Î²-peptide, the appearance of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, extensive neuronal loss and synaptic changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These processes induce inflammatory pathways by activating microglia, astrocytes and infiltrating leukocytes that produce inflammatory mediators including cytokines and prostaglandins.Prostaglandins are small lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid by multi-enzymatic pathways in which cyclooxygenases and phospholipases are the rate-limiting enzymes. In the central nervous system, prostaglandins exhibit either neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects by acting on specific G-protein-coupled receptors that have different subfamilies and differences in their selective agonists, tissue distribution and signal transduction cascades. Further studies on the role of prostaglandins in Alzheimer's disease may contribute to clarification of their neuroprotective actions, which may lead to the development of successful therapeutic strategies.  
24392109	Development of a screening algorithm for Alzheimer's disease using categorical verbal fluency.
PLoS ONE 20140102 2014
We developed a weighted composite score of the categorical verbal fluency test (CVFT) that can more easily and widely screen Alzheimer's disease (AD) than the mini-mental status examination (MMSE). We administered the CVFT using animal category and MMSE to 423 community-dwelling mild probable AD patients and their age- and gender-matched cognitively normal controls. To enhance the diagnostic accuracy for AD of the CVFT, we obtained a weighted composite score from subindex scores of the CVFT using a logistic regression model: logit (case) â€Š=â€Š1.160+0.474Ã— gender +0.003Ã— age +0.226Ã— education level - 0.089Ã— first-half score - 0.516Ã— switching score -0.303Ã— clustering score +0.534Ã— perseveration score. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for AD of this composite score AD was 0.903 (95% CIâ€Š=â€Š0.883 - 0.923), and was larger than that of the age-, gender- and education-adjusted total score of the CVFT (p&lt;0.001). In 100 bootstrapped re-samples, the composite score consistently showed better diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for AD than the total score. Although AUC for AD of the CVFT composite score was slightly smaller than that of the MMSE (0.930, pâ€Š=â€Š0.006), the CVFT composite score may be a good alternative to the MMSE for screening AD since it is much briefer, cheaper, and more easily applicable over phone or internet than the MMSE.  
24313554	Potential novel targets for Alzheimer pharmacotherapy: II. Update on secretase inhibitors and related approaches.
J Clin Pharm Ther 20131208 2014Feb
The prevailing theory regarding Alzheimer disease (AD) is that insoluble amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) plays a critical role in the cortical plaques characteristic of the disease. Because AÎ² is formed from the sequential splicing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) catalysed by 'secretase' enzymes (Î±, Î² and Î³), clinical trials of secretase inhibitors will either result in beneficial pharmacotherapy or, if negative, cast doubt on the role of AÎ² in AD. With recent clinical trial failures, is the AÎ² theory wrong? Literature searches were conducted on the topics of secretases and clinical trials, including PubMed searches, United States clinical trials directory, pharmaceutical company websites and news reports. The information was collected and evaluated for relevance and quality. Several direct-acting (e.g. CTS-21166, LY2811376) and indirect-acting (e.g. ACI-91) Î²-secretase inhibitors and several Î³-secretase inhibitors (e.g. avagacestat, JNJ-40418677 and semagacestat) have not fared well in early clinical trials due to the lack of efficacy or concerns over possible serious side effects. The failures of secretase inhibitors in clinical trials appear to bring into question the long-hypothesized association between AD and AÎ² production. However, the disease might have been too advanced in these patients to benefit from this type of therapy (mainly preventive). Secretase inhibitors are still being studied, along with new diagnostic tools, with the hope of testing patients earlier, that is, with less advanced disease. If these trials also fail, the prevailing view of the role of AÎ² in AD will truly be in doubt. 
24029643	Increased number of microinfarcts in Alzheimer disease at 7-T MR imaging.
Radiology 20131028 2014Jan
To assess the prevalence and number of cortical microinfarcts in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) by using a 7-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system, to assess the independent association of cortical microinfarcts with cognitive dysfunction, and to investigate potential confounding effects of the coexisting presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The local institutional review board approved this study. In all cases, informed consent was obtained. High-spatial-resolution fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2*-weighted images were acquired in 14 AD patients and 18 control subjects to assess the presence of microinfarcts and microbleeds. Presence of CAA was assessed according to the Boston criteria. Image analysis was performed independently by two reviewers. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess differences in number of microinfarcts between groups. Negative binomial regression models were used to assess the association between diagnosis of AD and diagnosis of CAA and number of microinfarcts, between diagnosis of AD and number of microbleeds and number of microinfarcts, and between cognitive function and number of microinfarcts, all corrected for age and sex. Interobserver agreement was excellent for detecting microinfarcts (Îº = 0.91) (P &lt; .001). Patients with AD demonstrated higher number (P = .005) of microinfarcts (mean, 7.2) compared with control subjects (mean, 1.8). Negative binomial regression models showed an independent association between AD and number of microinfarcts (P = .006) and a trend for CAA and microinfarcts (P = .052). A negative correlation was found between cognitive function and the number of microinfarcts (P = .009). Patients with AD show more microinfarcts than do control subjects, the number of microinfarcts correlates with global cognitive performance, and the presence of microinfarcts was mainly AD rather than CAA related. 
23477782	Approaches to a multitargeting drug development: first profiled 3- ethoxycarbonyl-1-aza-9-oxafluorenes representing a perspective compound class targeting Alzheimer disease relevant kinases CDK1, CDK5 and GSK-3Î².
Med Chem  2014
Since Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease, recent therapeutical approaches concentrate on the development of a multitargeting drug. Various protein kinases are known to be involved in the progression of AD. A first series of 3-ethoxycarbonyl-1-aza-9-oxafluorenes has been synthesized and biologically evaluated as AD-relevant protein kinase inhibitors. A concentration-dependent inhibition of important AD-relevant kinases has been characterized after the selectivity of kinase inhibition had been demonstrated. Structure-activity relationships of protein kinase inhibition are discussed and first multitargeting inhibitors have been identified.  
23322167	Corpus callosum shape changes in early Alzheimer's disease: an MRI study using the OASIS brain database.
Brain Struct Funct 20130116 2014Jan
The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest fiber bundle connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres. It has been a region examined extensively for indications of various pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Almost all previous studies of the CC in AD have been concerned with its size, particularly its mid-sagittal cross-sectional area (CCA). In this study, we show that the CC shape, characterized by its circularity (CIR), may be affected more profoundly than its size in early AD. MRI scans (n = 196) were obtained from the publicly available Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. The CC cross-sectional region on the mid-sagittal section of the brain was automatically segmented using a novel algorithm. The CCA and CIR were compared in 98 normal controls (NC) subjects, 70 patients with very mild AD (AD-VM), and 28 patients with mild AD (AD-M). Statistical analysis of covariance controlling for age and intracranial capacity showed that both the CIR and the CCA were significantly reduced in the AD-VM group relative to the NC group (CIR: p = 0.004; CCA: p = 0.005). However, only the CIR was significantly different between the AD-M and AD-VM groups (p = 0.006) being smaller in the former. The CCA was not significantly different between the AD-M and AD-VM groups. The results suggest that CC shape may be a more sensitive marker than its size for monitoring the progression of AD. In order to facilitate independent analyses, the CC segmentations and the CCA and CIR data used in this study have been made publicly available (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/art). 
24095218	Genetic variation in PICALM and Alzheimer's disease risk in Han Chinese.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131003 2014Apr
The current study was conducted to investigate the association of phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein gene (PICALM) with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk in Han Chinese. We first sequenced PICALM for variants in a small sample (n = 100), and the selected variants were then genotyped in a larger cohort (n = 2292). Sequencing analysis identified 16 variants within PICALM including 5 new variants with extreme low frequency in the northern Han Chinese population. However, in the subsequent genotyping, none showed a significant association with LOAD risk after Bonferroni correction. These findings implicate that PICALM might not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to LOAD in Han Chinese. 
24112788	Increased pro-nerve growth factor and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor in non-Alzheimer's disease tauopathies.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131008 2014Apr
Alterations in the expression and signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the precursor to nerve growth factor (NGF), proNGF, play a role in the neuronal and cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease. Aggregated amyloid-Î² has been shown to down-regulate specific BDNF transcripts in Alzheimer's disease, but the role of tau pathology in neurotrophin dysregulation has not been investigated. We measured levels of BDNF mRNA and protein using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and proNGF protein using Western blotting in parietal cortex of subjects with tauopathies, neurodegenerative diseases exhibiting tau pathology without amyloid-Î² accumulation. We observed a significant increase in the level of proNGF protein in Pick's disease and a significant decrease in BDNF mRNA and protein levels in Pick's disease and corticobasal degeneration, but no neurotrophin alterations in progressive supranuclear palsy. The decrease in total BDNF mRNA levels in these tauopathies was predominantly due to down-regulation of transcript IV. These findings implicate tau pathology in neurotrophin dysregulation, which may represent a mechanism through which tau confers toxicity in Alzheimer's disease and related non-Alzheimer's dementias.  
24176626	Evaluation of late-onset Alzheimer disease genetic susceptibility risks in a Canadian population.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131028 2014Apr
We performed case-control studies using 2 Canadian cohorts to examine the role of 10 promising Alzheimer's disease (AD) loci identified in recent genomewide association studies. Patients age 65 years and older diagnosed with AD at baseline (prevalent cases) or who developed AD during follow-up assessments (incident cases) were compared with control subjects with no cognitive impairment. Our prevalent case study comparing prevalent AD cases (n = 428) with participants with no cognitive impairment (n = 524) revealed a significant association of rs6656401 and rs3818361 (CR1), rs2075650 (TOMM40), rs7561528 (BIN1), and rs3865444 (CD33) with late-onset AD that were robust to adjustment with age and apolipoprotein E Îµ4 genotype. The incident case study comparing patients who developed AD during longitudinal observation (n = 152) with participants with no cognitive impairment found that rs2075650 (TOMM40) and rs3865444 (CD33) influence the risk of developing AD in this population. In addition, pooled analysis of our AD patients confirmed that CR1, TOMM40, BIN1, and CD33 contribute to late-onset AD susceptibility, in addition to apolipoprotein E. 
24184202	Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 variant is rare in late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese individuals.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131011 2014Apr
Recent studies have reported that a rare mutation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 gene (TREM2 [rs75932628-T]) has significantly increased the risk of late-onset Alzhemier's disease (LOAD) in European-descendent population. To date, no study has investigated the association between rare mutations of TREM2 and LOAD risk in non-European population. Here, we sequenced exon2 of TREM2 in the northern Han Chinese population consisting of 1133 patients with LOAD and 1159 control subjects. Although, 4 novel mutations (c.102G&gt;A: Val34Val, c.330C&gt;T: Cys110Cys, c.342T&gt;C: His114His, and c.343G&gt;A: Gly115Ser) were identified in patients with LOAD, none of them exhibited significant association with LOAD risk after Bonferroni correction. Most importantly, the previously reported rare variants in European-descendent population including rs75932628-T (predicted to cause an R47H substitution) were absent in our cohort. These findings suggest that mutations in exon2 of TREM2 were unlikely to play a key role in the susceptibility of LOAD in the northern Han Chinese population.  
24199959	Genetic and biochemical markers in patients with Alzheimer's disease support a concerted systemic iron homeostasis dysregulation.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131017 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly individuals, resulting from a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Impaired brain iron homeostasis has been recognized as an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of this disease. Nevertheless, the knowledge gathered so far at the systemic level is clearly insufficient. Herein, we used an integrative approach to study iron metabolism in the periphery, at both genotypic and phenotypic levels, in a sample of 116 patients with AD and 89 healthy control subjects. To assess the potential impact of iron metabolism on the risk of developing AD, genetic analyses were performed along with the evaluation of the iron status profile in peripheral blood by biochemical and gene expression studies. The results obtained showed a significant decrease of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin concentrations in patients compared with the control subjects. Also, a significant decrease of ferroportin (SLC40A1) and both transferrin receptors TFRC and TFR2 transcripts was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients. At the genetic level, significant associations with AD were found for single nucleotide polymorphisms in TF, TFR2, ACO1, and SLC40A1 genes. Apolipoprotein E gene, a well-known risk factor for AD, was also found significantly associated with the disease in this study. Taken together, we hypothesize that the alterations on systemic iron status observed in patients could reflect an iron homeostasis dysregulation, particularly in cellular iron efflux. The intracellular iron accumulation would lead to a rise in oxidative damage, contributing to AD pathophysiology.  
24211009	A role for the neurexin-neuroligin complex in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131106 2014Apr
Synaptic damage is a critical hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and the best correlate with cognitive impairment ante mortem. Synapses, the loci of communication between neurons, are characterized by signature protein combinations arrayed at tightly apposed pre- and post-synaptic sites. The most widely studied trans-synaptic junctional complexes, which direct synaptogenesis and foster the maintenance and stability of the mature terminal, are conjunctions of presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins. Fluctuations in the levels of neuroligins and neurexins can sway the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, and could lead to damage of synapses and dendrites. This review summarizes current understanding of the roles of neurexins and neuroligins proteolytic processing in synaptic plasticity in the human brain, and outlines their possible roles in Î²-amyloid metabolism and function, which are central pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease progression.  
24231519	Cardiovascular disease contributes to Alzheimer's disease: evidence from large-scale genome-wide association studies.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131019 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and complex neurodegenerative disease in the elderly individuals. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to investigate AD pathogenesis. These GWAS have yielded important new insights into the genetic mechanisms of AD. However, these newly identified AD susceptibility loci exert only very small risk effects and cannot fully explain the underlying AD genetic risk. We hypothesize that combining the findings from different AD GWAS may have greater power than genetic analysis alone. To identify new AD risk factors, we integrated findings from 3 previous large-scale AD GWAS (n = 14,138) using a gene-based meta-analysis and subsequently conducted a pathway analysis using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes and gene ontology databases. Interestingly, we not only confirmed previous findings, but also highlighted, for the first time, the involvement of cardiovascular disease-related pathways in AD. Our results provided the clues as to the link between these diseases using pathway analysis methods. We believe that these findings will be very useful for future genetic studies of AD. 
24238656	Epigenetically regulated microRNAs in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131018 2014Apr
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving dysregulation of many biological pathways at multiple levels. Classical epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, and regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs), are among the major regulatory elements that control these pathways at the molecular level, with epigenetic modifications regulating gene expression transcriptionally and miRNAs suppressing gene expression posttranscriptionally. Epigenetic mechanisms and miRNAs have recently been shown to closely interact with each other, thereby creating reciprocal regulatory circuits, which appear to be disrupted in neuronal and glial cells affected by AD. Here, we review those miRNAs implicated in AD that are regulated by promoter DNA methylation and/or chromatin modifications and, which frequently direct the expression of constituents of the epigenetic machinery, concluding with the delineation of a complex epigenetic-miRNA regulatory network and its alterations in AD.  
24239383	Neuroprotective effects of the amylin analogue pramlintide on Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and cognition.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131011 2014Apr
Amylin is a metabolic peptide hormone that is co-secreted with insulin from beta cells in the pancreas and activates many of the downstream targets of insulin. To investigate the relationship between this hormone and Alzheimer's disease (AD), we measured plasma human amylin levels in 206 subjects with AD, 64 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 111 subjects with no cognitive impairment and found significantly lower amylin levels among subjects with AD and mild cognitive impairment compared with the cognitively intact subjects. To investigate mechanisms underlying amylin's effects in the brain, we administered chronic infusions of the amylin analog pramlintide in the senescence-accelerated prone mouse, a mouse model of sporadic AD. Pramlintide administration improved performance in the novel object recognition task, a validated test of memory and cognition. The pramlintide-treated mice had increased expression of the synaptic marker synapsin I and the kinase cyclin-dependent kinase-5 in the hippocampus, as well as decreased oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the hippocampus. A dose-dependent increase in cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and activation of extracellular-signal-regulated-kinases 1/2 by pramlintide treatment in vitro was also present indicating functionality of the amylin receptor in neurons. Together these results suggest that amylin analogs have neuroprotective properties and might be of therapeutic benefit in AD. 
24306222	Differential expression of proteins in brain regions of Alzheimer's disease patients.
Neurochem. Res. 20131204 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia and cognitive impairment is usually characterized by neuritic amyloid plaques, cerebrovascular amyloidosis and neurofibrillary tangles. In order to find out the pathological protein expression, a quantitative proteome analysis of AD hippocampus, substantia nigra and cortex was performed and the extent of protein expression variation not only in contrast to age-matched controls but also among the understudied regions was analyzed. Expression alterations of 48 proteins were observed in each region along with significant co/contra regulation of malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase B chain, aconitate hydratase, protein NipSnap homolog 2, actin cytoplasmic 1, creatine kinase U-type and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. These differentially expressed proteins are mainly involved in energy metabolism, cytoskeleton integration, apoptosis and several other potent cellular/molecular processes. Interaction association network analysis further confirms the close interacting relationship between the co/contra regulated differentially expressed proteins among all the three regions. Elucidation of co/contra regulation of differentially expressed proteins will be helpful to understand disease progression and functional alterations associated with AD. 
24149893	Mesenchymal stem cells enhance autophagy and increase Î²-amyloid clearance in Alzheimer disease models.
Autophagy 20130101 2014Jan
Current evidence suggests a central role for autophagy in Alzheimer disease (AD), and dysfunction in the autophagic system may lead to amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) accumulation. Using in vitro and in vivo AD models, the present study investigated whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could enhance autophagy and thus exert a neuroprotective effect through modulation of AÎ² clearance In AÎ²-treated neuronal cells, MSCs increased cellular viability and enhanced LC3-II expression compared with cells treated with AÎ² only. Immunofluorescence revealed that MSC coculture in AÎ²-treated neuronal cells increased the number of LC3-II-positive autophagosomes that were colocalized with a lysosomal marker. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that most autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in AÎ²-treated cells were not fused with lysosomes, whereas a large portion of autophagosomes were conjoined with lysosomes in MSCs cocultured with AÎ²-treated neuronal cells. Furthermore, MSC coculture markedly increased AÎ² immunoreactivity colocalized within lysosomes and decreased intracellular AÎ² levels compared with AÎ²-treated cells. In AÎ²-treated animals, MSC administration significantly increased autophagosome induction, final maturation of late AVs, and fusion with lysosomes. Moreover, MSC administration significantly reduced the level of AÎ² in the hippocampus, which was elevated in AÎ²-treated mice, concomitant with increased survival of hippocampal neurons. Finally, MSC coculture upregulated BECN1/Beclin 1 expression in AD models. These results suggest that MSCs significantly enhance autolysosome formation and clearance of AÎ² in AD models, which may lead to increased neuronal survival against AÎ² toxicity. Modulation of the autophagy pathway to repair the damaged AD brain using MSCs would have a significant impact on future strategies for AD treatment.  
24372885	Matched and mismatched appraisals of the effectiveness of communication strategies by family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease.
Int J Lang Commun Disord 20131024 2014 Jan-Feb
Communication problems stemming from Alzheimer's disease (AD) often result in misunderstandings that can be linked with problem behaviours and increased caregiver stress. Moreover, these communication breakdowns also can result either from caregivers' use of ineffective communication strategies, which paradoxically are perceived as helpful, or can occur as a result of not using effective communication strategies that are perceived as unhelpful. The two primary aims were to determine the effectiveness of strategies used to resolve communication breakdowns and to examine whether caregivers' ratings of strategy effectiveness were consistent with evidence from video-recorded conversations and with effective communication strategies documented in the literature. Twenty-eight mealtime conversations were recorded using a sample of 15 dyads consisting of individuals with early, middle and late clinical-stage AD and their family caregivers. Conversations were analysed using the trouble-source repair paradigm to identify the communication strategies used by caregivers to resolve breakdowns. Family caregivers also rated the helpfulness of communication strategies used to resolve breakdowns. Analyses were conducted to assess the overlap or match between the use and appraisals of the helpfulness of communication strategies. Matched and mismatched appraisals of communication strategies varied across stages of AD. Matched appraisals by caregivers of persons with early-stage AD were observed for 68% of 22 communication strategies, whereas caregivers of persons with middle- and late-stage AD had matched appraisals for 45% and 55% of the strategies, respectively. Moreover, caregivers of persons with early-stage AD had matched appraisals over and above making matched appraisals by chance alone, compared with caregivers of persons in middle- and late-stage AD. Mismatches illustrate the need for communication education and training, particularly to establish empirically derived evidence-based communication strategies over the clinical course of AD. 
24021662	Active and passive immunization strategies based on the SDPM1 peptide demonstrate pre-clinical efficacy in the APPswePSEN1dE9 mouse model for Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20130908 2014Feb
Recent clinical and pre-clinical studies suggest that both active and passive immunization strategies targeting AÎ² amyloid may have clinical benefit in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we demonstrate that vaccination of APPswePSEN1dE9 mice with SDPM1, an engineered non-native AÎ² amyloid-specific binding peptide, lowers brain AÎ² amyloid plaque burden and brain AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 peptide levels, improves cognitive learning and memory in Morris water maze tests and increases the expression of synaptic brain proteins. This was the case in young mice immunized prior to development of significant brain amyloid burden, and in older mice, where brain amyloid was already present. Active immunization was optimized using ALUM as an adjuvant to stimulate production of anti-SDPM1 and anti-AÎ² amyloid antibodies. Intracerebral injection of P4D6, an SDPM1 peptide-mimotope antibody, also lowered brain amyloid plaque burden in APPswePSEN1dE9 mice. Additionally, P4D6 inhibited AÎ² amyloid-mediated toxicity in cultured neuronal cells. The protein sequence of the variable domain within the P4D6 heavy chain was found to mimic a multimer of the SDPM1 peptide motif. These data demonstrate the efficacy of active and passive vaccine strategies to target AÎ² amyloid oligomers using an engineered peptide-mimotope strategy.  
24095978	The Janus face of the heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase system in Alzheimer disease: it's time for reconciliation.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20131002 2014Feb
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among the elderly and is characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognition. These clinical features are due in part to the increase of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that mediate neurotoxic effects. The up-regulation of the heme oxygenase-1/biliverdin reductase-A (HO-1/BVR-A) system is one of the earlier events in the adaptive response to stress. HO-1/BVR-A reduces the intracellular levels of pro-oxidant heme and generates equimolar amounts of the free radical scavengers biliverdin-IX alpha (BV)/bilirubin-IX alpha (BR) as well as the pleiotropic gaseous neuromodulator carbon monoxide (CO) and ferrous iron. Two main and opposite hypotheses for a role of the HO-1/BVR-A system in AD propose that this system mediates neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects, respectively. This apparent controversy was mainly due to the fact that for over about 20years HO-1 was the only player on which all the analyses were focused, excluding the other important and essential component of the entire system, BVR. Following studies from the Butterfield laboratory that reported alterations in BVR activity along with decreased phosphorylation and increased oxidative/nitrosative post-translational modifications in the brain of subjects with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, a debate was opened on the real pathophysiological and clinical significance of BVR-A. In this paper we provide a review of the main discoveries about the HO/BVR system in AD and MCI, and propose a mechanism that reconciles these two hypotheses noted above of neurotoxic and the neuroprotective aspects of this important stress responsive system.  
24141019	Microglial derived tumor necrosis factor-Î± drives Alzheimer's disease-related neuronal cell cycle events.
Neurobiol. Dis. 20131017 2014Feb
Massive neuronal loss is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms are still unclear. Here we demonstrate that neuroinflammation, cell autonomous to microglia, is capable of inducing neuronal cell cycle events (CCEs), which are toxic for terminally differentiated neurons. First, oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide (AÎ²O)-mediated microglial activation induced neuronal CCEs via the tumor-necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±) and the c-Jun Kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Second, adoptive transfer of CD11b+ microglia from AD transgenic mice (R1.40) induced neuronal cyclin D1 expression via TNFÎ± signaling pathway. Third, genetic deficiency of TNFÎ± in R1.40 mice (R1.40-TnfÎ±(-/-)) failed to induce neuronal CCEs. Finally, the mitotically active neurons spatially co-exist with F4/80+ activated microglia in the human AD brain and that a portion of these neurons are apoptotic. Together our data suggest a cell-autonomous role of microglia, and identify TNFÎ± as the responsible cytokine, in promoting neuronal CCEs in the pathogenesis of AD.  
24219606	Clinical and psychological characteristics of the initial cohort of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN).
Neuropsychology 20131111 2014Jan
The purpose was to describe clinical, cognitive, and personality characteristics at baseline assessment of 249 participants, 19 to 60 years of age, in a multinational longitudinal study of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Participants (74% cognitively normal) were from ADAD families with mutations in 1 of 3 genes (APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2). Mixed model analyses, including family as a random variable and controlling for years from expected time of symptomatic onset of ADAD based on parental age at onset, compared 3 groups (cognitively normal mutation noncarriers, cognitively normal mutation carriers, very mildly impaired mutation carriers). Global cognitive deficits similar to those observed in late-life sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) existed in very mild ADAD compared with cognitively normal carriers and noncarriers on all but 2 measures (Digit Span Backward, Letter Fluency for FAS) of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, attention, and speeded visuospatial abilities. Demented individuals were less extraverted, open, and conscientious than cognitively normal participants on the International Personality Item Pool. Differences in the relation between 3 measures (Logical Memory, Digit Symbol, attention switching) and time to expected age at symptomatic onset indicate that cognitive deficits on some measures can be detected in mutation carriers prior to symptomatic AD, and hence should be useful markers in subsequent longitudinal follow-up. Overall cognitive and personality deficits in very mild ADAD are similar to those seen in sporadic AD. Cognitive deficits also occur in asymptomatic mutation carriers who are closer to the expected time of dementia onset. 
23895348	Dysregulation of leptin signaling in Alzheimer disease: evidence for neuronal leptin resistance.
J. Neurochem. 20130821 2014Jan
Leptin signaling has received considerable attention in the Alzheimer disease (AD) field. Within the past decade, the peptide hormone has been demonstrated to attenuate tau hyperphosphorylation in neuronal cells and to be modulated by amyloid-Î². Moreover, a role in neuroprotection and neurogenesis within the hippocampus has been shown in animal models. To further characterize the association between leptin signaling and vulnerable regions in AD, we assessed the profile of leptin and the leptin receptor in AD and control patients. We analyzed leptin levels in CSF, and the concentration and localization of leptin and leptin receptor in the hippocampus. Significant elevations in leptin levels in both CSF and hippocampal tissue of AD patients, compared with age-matched control cases, indicate a physiological up-regulation of leptin in AD. However, the level of leptin receptor mRNA decreased in AD brain and the leptin receptor protein was localized to neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting a severe discontinuity in the leptin signaling pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that leptin resistance in the hippocampus may play a role in the characteristic changes associated with the disease. These findings are the first to demonstrate such dysregulated leptin-signaling circuitry and provide novel insights into the possible role of aberrant leptin signaling in AD. In this study, increased leptin was found in CSF and hippocampus in Alzheimer disease indicating its physiological up-regulation, yet leptin receptor mRNA was decreased and leptin receptor protein was localized to neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting a discontinuity in the leptin signaling pathway. The lack of leptin signaling within degenerating neurons may represent a novel neuronal leptin resistance in Alzheimer disease.  
23919567	Mechanism of cholesterol-assisted oligomeric channel formation by a short Alzheimer Î²-amyloid peptide.
J. Neurochem. 20130828 2014Jan
Alzheimer Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) peptides can self-organize into oligomeric ion channels with high neurotoxicity potential. Cholesterol is believed to play a key role in this process, but the molecular mechanisms linking cholesterol and amyloid channel formation have so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the short AÎ²22-35 peptide, which encompasses the cholesterol-binding domain of AÎ², induces a specific increase of Ca(2+) levels in neural cells. This effect is neither observed in calcium-free medium nor in cholesterol-depleted cells, and is inhibited by zinc, a blocker of amyloid channel activity. Double mutations V24G/K28G and N27R/K28R in AÎ²22-35 modify cholesterol binding and abrogate channel formation. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that cholesterol induces a tilted Î±-helical topology of AÎ²22-35. This facilitates the establishment of an inter-peptide hydrogen bond network involving Asn-27 and Lys-28, a key step in the octamerization of AÎ²22-35 which proceeds gradually until the formation of a perfect annular channel in a phosphatidylcholine membrane. Overall, these data give mechanistic insights into the role of cholesterol in amyloid channel formation, opening up new therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease. AÎ²22-35 peptide, which encompasses the cholesterol binding domain of AÎ², induces a specific increase of Ca(2+) level in neural cells. Double mutations V24G/K28G and N27R/K28R modify cholesterol binding and abrogate channels formation. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that cholesterol induces a tilted Î±-helical peptide topology facilitating the formation of annular octameric channels, as schematically shown in the graphic (with a hydrogen bond shown in green for two vicinal peptides). Overall, the data give insights into the role of cholesterol in amyloid channel formation and open up new therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease.  
24367955	Systematic review of the effects of exercise on activities of daily living in people with Alzheimer's disease.
Am J Occup Ther  2014 Jan-Feb
OBJECTIVE. Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in a loss of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs), which in turn affects the quality of life of affected people and places a burden on caretakers. Limited research has examined the influence of physical training (aerobic, balance, and strength training) on ADL performance of people with AD. METHOD. Six randomized controlled trials (total of 446 participants) fit the inclusion criteria. For each study, we calculated effect sizes for primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS. Average effect size (95% confidence interval) for exercise on the primary outcome (ADL performance) was 0.80 (p &lt; .001). Exercise had a moderate impact on the secondary outcome of physical function (effect size = 0.53, p = .004). CONCLUSION. Occupational therapy intervention that includes aerobic and strengthening exercises may help improve independence in ADLs and improve physical performance in people with AD. Additional research is needed to identify specific components of intervention and optimal dosage to develop clinical guidelines.  
24217279	An 85-Year Old Male with Levodopa-Responsive Parkinsonism Followed by Dementia and Supranuclear Ophthalmoplegia Caused by Alzheimer-Type Pathology without Lewy Bodies.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
An 85-year-old man developed l-dopa responsive parkinsonism indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease and subsequent dementia, followed by supranuclear ophthalmoplegia and neck dorsiflexion at the terminal stage. Midbrain tegmentum and medial temporal lobe were atrophic on magnetic resonance imaging, while decreased blood flow was predominant in frontotemporal lobes, detected by 3D-SSP of 123I- IMP SPECT. Alzheimer-type pathology without Lewy body pathology was confirmed at autopsy. Substantia nigra showed mild degeneration and several neurofibrillary tangles without Lewy body pathology or progressive supranuclear palsy cytopathology. L-dopa responsive parkinsonism could be an initial manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, which should be included in the differential diagnosis.  
24246420	CERAD Neuropsychological Compound Scores are Accurate in Detecting Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease: A Prospective AddNeuroMed Study.
J. Alzheimers Dis.  2014Jan1
The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Battery (CERAD-NB) is a widely used tool in screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, it does not include a validated total score for delayed memory. Our aim was to develop clinically applicable memory compound scores for CERAD-NB and examine whether they and global cognitive total scores could detect prodromal AD and cognitive progression in MCI. One year follow-up data of 201 subjects with a baseline diagnosis of MCI (46 progressed to AD; 155 remained stable) and 212 controls in the European multicenter AddNeuroMed study were analyzed. Two previously described cognitive total scores and two memory compound scores were tabulated for CERAD-NB. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was applied in the group discrimination at baseline and the annual change for different compound scores was examined. Normative cut-offs for CERAD compound scores were tabulated in the Finnish CERAD sample of 306 controls. Country adjusted CERAD compound scores (AUC 0.95-0.96) were more accurate than Word List Recall (AUC 0.93) and Mini-Mental State Examination (AUC 0.90) in discriminating progressive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects from controls. With normative cut-off values CERAD total scores yielded to 87-89% sensitivity and 84-86% specificity in screening for prodromal AD in a separate multinational population. The annual deterioration in all CERAD compound scores was significant in the progressive (p â‰¤ 0.001) but not in the stable MCI group (p &gt; 0.08). CERAD total scores are a practical way of screening for prodromal AD and assessing cognitive progression in MCI. The new memory compound scores were more accurate than CERAD subtests in predicting AD conversion.  
24359699	Regional white matter lesions predict falls in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
J Am Med Dir Assoc  2014Jan
Preventive strategy for falls in demented elderly is a clinical challenge. From early-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients show impaired balance and gait. The purpose of this study is to determine whether regional white matter lesions (WMLs) can predict balance/gait disturbance and falls in elderly with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or AD. Cross-sectional. Hospital out-patient clinic. One hundred sixty-three patients diagnosed with aMCI or AD were classified into groups having experienced falls (n = 63) or not (n = 100) in the previous year. Cognition, depression, behavior and psychological symptoms of dementia, medication, and balance/gait function were evaluated. Regional WMLs were visually analyzed as periventricular hyperintensity in frontal caps, bands, and occipital caps, and as deep white matter hyperintensity in frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem. Brain atrophy was linearly measured. The fallers had a greater volume of WMLs and their posture/gait performance tended to be worse than nonfallers. Several WMLs in particular brain regions were closely associated with balance and gait impairment. Besides polypharmacy, periventricular hyperintensity in frontal caps and occipital WMLs were strong predictors for falls, even after potential risk factors for falls were considered. Regional white matter burden, independent of cognitive decline, correlates with balance/gait disturbance and predicts falls in elderly with aMCI and AD. Careful insight into regional WMLs on brain magnetic resonance may greatly help to diagnose demented elderly with a higher risk of falls. 
24200817	Decreased rabphilin 3A immunoreactivity in Alzheimer's disease is associated with AÎ² burden.
Neurochem. Int. 20131105 2014Jan
Synaptic dysfunction, together with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and cholinergic neuron loss is an established finding in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) neocortex. The synaptopathology of AD is known to involve both pre- and postsynaptic components. However, the status of rabphilin 3A (RPH3A), which interacts with the SNARE complex and regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release, is at present unclear. In this study, we measured RPH3A and its ligand Rab3A as well as several SNARE proteins in postmortem neocortex of patients with AD, and found specific reductions of RPH3A immunoreactivity compared with aged controls. RPH3A loss correlated with dementia severity, cholinergic deafferentation, and increased Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) concentrations. Furthermore, RPH3A expression is selectively downregulated in cultured neurons treated with AÎ²25-35 peptides. Our data suggest that presynaptic SNARE dysfunction forms part of the synaptopathology of AD.  
24211710	Impaired electro-genesis in skeletal muscle fibers of transgenic Alzheimer mice.
Neurochem. Int. 20131106 2014Jan
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory decline, but is often associated with non-cognitive symptoms, including muscular dysfunction. In the majority of cases these motor disturbances are seen when other neuro-degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease overlap dementia, however these can also be directly related to AD itself. Although the patho-mechanism remains largely unclear, Î²-amyloid peptide (Î²AP) is thought to be a key role-player in both the brain and periphery. Here we studied the electro-genesis of skeletal muscle fibers in a mouse transgenic AD model. Membrane potential was recorded by standard electro-physiological techniques. Compared to wild-type rodents, AD mice show severe disturbances in skeletal muscle electro-genesis manifested by significant depolarization of myo-fibers. These changes are not affected by short-term Î²AP treatment, the mark of a chronic degenerative process in the periphery directly related to AD whereby ion pumps on muscle membranes exhibit reduced activity. This phenomenon may explain ionic imbalance and cellular dysfunction both in the neuro-muscular system and in the brain. The observed motor disturbances might play a key role in impaired activities of daily living, and addressing the muscular patho-physiology could improve quality of life in AD.  
24331082	On the relation among mood, apathy, and anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease.
J Int Neuropsychol Soc 20131213 2014Jan
This review explores the relationships between depression, apathy, and anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease. Depressed mood is found to be associated with less anosognosia, while greater apathy is associated with more anosognosia, and the contrasting reasons for these associations are discussed. The review also describes recent research findings indicating a dissociation between impaired awareness of condition/deficit and preserved emotional reactivity in response to illness-related material or the experience of failure in tests. We conclude by pointing to future directions for this area of research and clinical implications. 
24317476	cDNA microarray and bioinformatic analysis for the identification of key genes in Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Mol. Med. 20131204 2014Feb
In this study, gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were compared with those of healthy individuals to identify key differentially expressed genes (DEGs), in an effort to broaden our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases and identify potential therapeutic targets. The microarray data set GSE18309 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 3 AD, 3 MCI and 3 normal control (NC) samples. Raw data were processed and differential analysis was performed using the R multtest package. Two groups of comparisons (AD vs. NC and MCI vs. NC) were conducted and two groups of DEGs were acquired. The common DEGs were selected, for which functional enrichment analysis, as well as pathway enrichment analysis were performed to determine their roles in the development of the diseases in question. A total of 405 DEGs were identified in the AD vs. NC samples and 395 in the MCI vs. NC samples. A total of 60 common DEGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the most common functions of the DEGs identified were response to nutrients, muscle contraction and cellular homeostasis. As shown by pathway enrichment analysis, the most common pathway associated with the DEGs identifed was the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. A range of DEGs was identified in the present study, which may help to disclose the molecular mechanisms responsible for AD and may thus provide potential novel therapeutic strategies for Ad. 
23089633	Associations between gonadotropins, testosterone and Î² amyloid in men at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Mol. Psychiatry 20121023 2014Jan
Testosterone and gonadotropins have been associated with cognitive decline in men and the modulation of Î² amyloid (AÎ²) metabolism. The relatively few studies that have investigated whether changes in one or a combination of these hormones influence AÎ² levels have focused primarily on plasma AÎ²(1-40) and not on the more pathogenic AÎ²(1-42). Currently, no study has investigated whether these hormones are associated with an increase in brain amyloid deposition, ante mortem. Through the highly characterised Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle study, we have determined the impact of these hormones on plasma AÎ² levels and brain amyloid burden (Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention). Spearman's rank correlation and linear regression analysis was carried out across the cohort and within subclassifications. Luteinizing hormone (LH) was the only variable shown, in the total cohort, to have a significant impact on plasma AÎ²(1-40) and AÎ²(1-42) levels (beta=0.163, P&lt;0.001; beta=0.446, P&lt;0.001). This held in subjective memory complainers (SMC) (AÎ²(1-40); beta=0.208, P=0.017; AÎ²(1-42); beta=0.215, P=0.017) but was absent in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups. In SMC, increased frequency of the APOE-É›4 allele (beta=0.536, P&lt;0.001) and increasing serum LH levels (beta=0.421, P=0.004) had a significant impact on PiB retention. Whereas in MCI, PiB retention was associated with increased APOE-É›4 allele copy number (beta=0.674, P&lt;0.001) and decreasing calculated free testosterone (beta=-0.303, P=0.043). These findings suggest a potential progressive involvement of LH and testosterone in the early preclinical stages of AD. Furthermore, these hormones should be considered while attempting to predict AD at these earliest stages of the disease. 
24157928	Differential S-nitrosylation of proteins in Alzheimer's disease.
Neuroscience 20131022 2014Jan3
Numerous studies have provided evidence regarding the involvement of protein S-nitrosylation in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and its implication in the formation and accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. The identification of S-nitrosylated proteins can be a major step toward the understanding of mechanisms leading to neuronal degeneration. The present study targeted S-nitrosylated proteins in AD hippocampus, substantia nigra and cortex using the following work-flow that combines S-nitrosothiol-specific antibody detection, classical biotin switch method labeled with fluorescence dye followed by electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight tandem MS (ESI-QTOF MS/MS) identification. Endogenous nitrosocysteines were identified in 45 proteins, mainly involved in metabolism, signaling pathways, apoptosis and redox regulation as assigned by REACTOME and KEGG pathway database analysis. Superoxide dismutase (SOD2) [Mn], fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C (ALDOC) and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2 (VDAC2) showed differential S-nitrosylation signal, not previously reported in AD regions. Extensive neuronal atrophy with increased protein S-nitrosylation in AD regions is also evident from immunofluorescence studies using S-nitrosocysteine antibody. A number of plausible cysteine modification sites were predicted via Group-based Prediction System-S-nitrosothiols (GPS-SNO) 1.0 while STRING 8.3 analysis revealed functional annotations in the modified proteins. The findings are helpful in characterization of functional abnormalities and may facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms and biological function of S-nitrosylation in AD pathology.  
24490029	The influence and changes in the dosages of concomitantly used psychotropic drugs associated with the discontinuation of donepezil in severe Alzheimer's disease with behavioral and psychological symptoms on dementia: a preliminary open-label trial.
Ther Adv Psychopharmacol  2014Feb
We investigated the influence on behavioral and psychological symptoms on dementia (BPSD) and the changes in the dosages of concomitant psychotropic drugs associated with the discontinuation of donepezil in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) who developed BPSD during donepezil therapy. The subjects were 44 inpatients who had been diagnosed with AD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV). The outcome measures assessed were BPSD and cognitive function. BPSD was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental Examination (MMSE). The changes in the dosages of concomitant psychotropic drugs were also assessed. Significant decreases were found in the donepezil treatment discontinuation group in the following NPI total score and two NPI subscales (agitation and irritability), but no significant differences were seen between the donepezil treatment discontinuation group and the control group. Furthermore, the mean changes from baseline in the risperidone equivalent dose and the diazepam equivalent dose were hardly changed in the donepezil treatment discontinuation group. The results of this study suggest that the discontinuation of donepezil treatment in patients with AD with BPSD may afford superior efficacy and may make it possible to not increase the dosage of other psychotropic drugs. 
24468113	Reduced sphingosine kinase-1 and enhanced sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase expression demonstrate deregulated sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling in Alzheimer's disease.
Acta Neuropathol Commun 20140127 2014
The accumulation of beta amyloid (AÎ²) peptides, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Among its pleiotropic cellular effects, AÎ² accumulation has been associated with a deregulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) derived from sphingosine is emerging as a critical lipid mediator regulating various biological activities including cell proliferation, survival, migration, inflammation, or angiogenesis. S1P tissue level is low and kept under control through equilibrium between its synthesis mostly governed by sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) and its degradation by sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (SPL). We have previously reported that AÎ² peptides were able to decrease the activity of SphK1 in cell culture models, an effect that could be blocked by the prosurvival IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling. Herein, we report for the first time the expression of both SphK1 and SPL by immunohistochemistry in frontal and entorhinal cortices from 56 human AD brains. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a decreased expression of SphK1 and an increased expression of SPL both correlated to amyloid deposits in the entorhinal cortex. Otherwise, analysis of brain tissue extracts showed a decrease of SphK1 expression in AD brains whereas SPL expression was increased. The content of IGF-1R, an activator of SphK1, was found decreased in AD brains as well as S1P1, the major receptor for S1P. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of S1P in AD suggesting the existence of a global deregulation of S1P signaling in this disease from its synthesis by SphK1 and degradation by SPL to its signaling by the S1P1 receptor.

24474917	Fast parallel image registration on CPU and GPU for diagnostic classification of Alzheimer's disease.
Front Neuroinform 20140116 2013
Nonrigid image registration is an important, but time-consuming task in medical image analysis. In typical neuroimaging studies, multiple image registrations are performed, i.e., for atlas-based segmentation or template construction. Faster image registration routines would therefore be beneficial. In this paper we explore acceleration of the image registration package elastix by a combination of several techniques: (i) parallelization on the CPU, to speed up the cost function derivative calculation; (ii) parallelization on the GPU building on and extending the OpenCL framework from ITKv4, to speed up the Gaussian pyramid computation and the image resampling step; (iii) exploitation of certain properties of the B-spline transformation model; (iv) further software optimizations. The accelerated registration tool is employed in a study on diagnostic classification of Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls based on T1-weighted MRI. We selected 299 participants from the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Classification is performed with a support vector machine based on gray matter volumes as a marker for atrophy. We evaluated two types of strategies (voxel-wise and region-wise) that heavily rely on nonrigid image registration. Parallelization and optimization resulted in an acceleration factor of 4-5x on an 8-core machine. Using OpenCL a speedup factor of 2 was realized for computation of the Gaussian pyramids, and 15-60 for the resampling step, for larger images. The voxel-wise and the region-wise classification methods had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 88 and 90%, respectively, both for standard and accelerated registration. We conclude that the image registration package elastix was substantially accelerated, with nearly identical results to the non-optimized version. The new functionality will become available in the next release of elastix as open source under the BSD license.  
24478626	Pin1, a new player in the fate of HIF-1Î± degradation: an hypothetical mechanism inside vascular damage as Alzheimer's disease risk factor.
Front Cell Neurosci 20140117 2014
Aetiology of neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still under elucidation. The contribution of cerebrovascular deficiencies (such as cerebral ischemia/stroke) has been strongly endorsed in recent years. Reduction of blood supply leading to hypoxic condition is known to activate cellular responses mainly controlled by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1). Thus alterations of oxygen responsive HIF-1Î± subunit in the central nervous system may contribute to the cognitive decline, especially influencing mechanisms associated to amyloid precursor protein (APP) amyloidogenic metabolism. Although HIF-1Î± protein level is known to be regulated by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin-proteasome system, it has been recently suggested that glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (Gsk-3Î²) promotes a VHL-independent HIF-1Î± degradation. Here we provide evidences that in rat primary hippocampal cell cultures, HIF-1Î± degradation might be mediated by a synergic action of Gsk-3Î² and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (Pin1). In post-ischemic conditions, such as those mimicked with oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), HIF-1Î± protein level increases remaining unexpectedly high for long time after normal condition restoration jointly with the increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Î²-secretase 1 (BACE1) protein expression (70 and 140% respectively). Interestingly the Pin1 activity decreases about 40-60% and Pin1(S16) inhibitory phosphorylation significantly increases, indicating that Pin1 binding to its substrate and enzymatic activity are reduced by treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that HIF-1Î±/Pin1 in normoxia are associated, and that in presence of specific Pin1 and Gsk-3Î² inhibitors their interaction is reduced in parallel to an increase of HIF-1Î± protein level. Thus we suggest that in post-OGD neurons the high level of HIF-1Î± might be due to Pin1 binding ability and activity reduction which affects HIF-1Î± degradation: an event that may highlight the relevance of ischemia/HIF-1Î± as a risk factor in AD pathogenesis.  
24478669	Distinct neural systems underlying reduced emotional enhancement for positive and negative stimuli in early Alzheimer's disease.
Front Hum Neurosci 20140120 2013
Emotional information is typically better remembered than neutral content, and previous studies suggest that this effect is subserved particularly by the amygdala together with its interactions with the hippocampus. However, it is not known whether amygdala damage affects emotional memory performance at immediate and delayed recall, and whether its involvement is modulated by stimulus valence. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent more distributed neocortical regions involved in e.g., autobiographical memory, also contribute to emotional processing. We investigated these questions in a group of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects the amygdala, hippocampus and neocortical regions. Healthy controls (n = 14), patients with AD (n = 15) and its putative prodrome amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 11) completed a memory task consisting of immediate and delayed free recall of a list of positive, negative and neutral words. Memory performance was related to brain integrity in region of interest and whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses. In the brain-behavioral analyses, the left amygdala volume predicted the immediate recall of both positive and negative material, whereas at delay, left and right amygdala volumes were associated with performance with positive and negative words, respectively. Whole-brain analyses revealed additional associations between left angular gyrus integrity and the immediate recall of positive words as well as between the orbitofrontal cortex and the delayed recall of negative words. These results indicate that emotional memory impairments in AD may be underpinned by damage to regions implicated in emotional processing as well as frontoparietal regions, which may exert their influence via autobiographical memories and organizational strategies.  
23459238	Facilitating the use of implicit memory and learning in the physical therapy management of individuals with Alzheimer disease: a case series.
J Geriatr Phys Ther  2014 Jan-Mar
Physical rehabilitation of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) is often complicated by impairments in explicit memory and learning. Rehabilitation strategies that facilitate the use of the preserved implicit memory system may be effective in treating patients with AD. The purpose of this case series is to describe the application of these strategies, including high-repetition practice, errorless learning (EL), and spaced retrieval, to the physical therapy management of individuals with moderate AD. Three women aged 89 to 95 years with moderate AD who resided in an assisted living facility participated in physical therapy to address their mobility limitations. Twelve physical therapy sessions were scheduled over a period of 4 weeks. Interventions were individually designed to address the mobility needs of each patient, and rehabilitation strategies based on implicit learning principles were integrated into the interventions. All patients participated in at least 10 of the 12 physical therapy sessions. Improvements in performance of objective measures of balance were observed in all patients, although only 1 patient's balance score exceeded the minimal detectable change. No significant clinical change was observed in any patients on the Timed Up and Go Test or self-selected gait speed. Principles of implicit learning were integrated into the interventions for these patients with moderate AD. However, the feasibility of applying the EL paradigm was limited. Further research on the effectiveness of EL, spaced retrieval, and other rehabilitation strategies that facilitate implicit learning of mobility skills in patients with AD is needed to promote optimal physical therapy outcomes in this patient population. 
23822174	Depressive, functional status, and neuropsychiatric symptom trajectories before an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
Aging Ment Health 20130704 2014
This short report relied on multiyear data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center - Uniform Data Set (NACC-UDS) to examine whether significant changes occurred in functional status, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and depressive symptoms in the years before receiving an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. The secondary analysis used a retrospective cohort design. The NACC-UDS is a publicly accessible, longitudinal database that includes standardized data on neuropsychiatric symptoms, functional status, and depressive symptoms for Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) participants in the USA based on their annual visits from 2005 to 2011. ADC participants were considered diagnosed with AD if a follow-up data form indicated an affirmative response to whether the ADC participant had 'probable AD (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS)/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA))' or 'possible AD (NINCDS/ADRDA).' This yielded an analytic sample of 2478 individuals (139 with an eventual probable AD diagnosis, 109 individuals with an eventual possible AD diagnosis, and 2230 without any AD diagnosis) representing a total of 11,358 visits/points of data. Multilevel linear models revealed significant decreases (p &lt; 0.05) in functional status prior to a probable or possible AD diagnosis and significant increases in depressive symptoms prior to a probable AD diagnosis. Changes in functional and depressive symptoms were partly independent of cognitive decline. The longitudinal results lend additional support to conceptual and empirical models of pre-diagnosis declines in AD. 
23701205	St. John's Wort reduces beta-amyloid accumulation in a double transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model-role of P-glycoprotein.
Brain Pathol. 20130628 2014Jan
The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transport protein P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) is involved in the export of beta-amyloid from the brain into the blood, and there is evidence that age-associated deficits in cerebral P-glycoprotein content may be involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. P-glycoprotein function and expression can be pharmacologically induced by a variety of compounds including extracts of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort). To clarify the effect of St. John's Wort on the accumulation of beta-amyloid and P-glycoprotein expression in the brain, St. John's Wort extract (final hyperforin concentration 5%) was fed to 30-day-old male C57BL/6J-APP/PS1(+/-) mice over a period of 60 or 120 days, respectively. Age-matched male C57BL/6J-APP/PS1(+/-) mice receiving a St. John's Wort-free diet served as controls. Mice receiving St. John's Wort extract showed (i) significant reductions of parenchymal beta-amyloid 1-40 and 1-42 accumulation; and (ii) moderate, but statistically significant increases in cerebrovascular P-glycoprotein expression. Thus, the induction of cerebrovascular P-glycoprotein may be a novel therapeutic strategy to protect the brain from beta-amyloid accumulation, and thereby impede the progression of Alzheimer's disease.  
23802663	Sex differences in the cholinergic basal forebrain in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
Brain Pathol. 20130719 2014Jan
In the Down syndrome (DS) population, there is an early incidence of dementia and neuropathology similar to that seen in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), including dysfunction of the basal forebrain cholinergic neuron (BFCN) system. Using Ts65Dn mice, a model of DS and AD, we examined differences in the BFCN system between male and female segmentally trisomic (Ts65Dn) and disomic (2N) mice at ages 5-8 months. Quantitative stereology was applied to BFCN subfields immunolabeled for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) within the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band (MS/VDB), horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB) and nucleus basalis of Meynert/substantia innominata (NBM/SI). We found no sex differences in neuron number or subregion area measurement in the MS/VDB or HDB. However, 2N and Ts65Dn females showed an average 34% decrease in BFCN number and an average 20% smaller NBM/SI region area compared with genotype-matched males. Further, relative to genotype-matched males, female mice had smaller BFCNs in all subregions. These findings demonstrate that differences between the sexes in BFCNs of young adult Ts65Dn and 2N mice are region and genotype specific. In addition, changes in post-processing tissue thickness suggest altered parenchymal characteristics between male and female Ts65Dn mice.  
24456642	Loss of the neuroprotective factor Sphingosine 1-phosphate early in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
Acta Neuropathol Commun 20140123 2014
The greatest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the Ïµ4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE regulates secretion of the potent neuroprotective signaling lipid Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is derived by phosphorylation of sphingosine, catalysed by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SphK1 and 2), and SphK1 positively regulates glutamate secretion and synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons. S1P and its receptor family have been subject to intense pharmacological interest in recent years, following approval of the immunomodulatory drug Fingolimod, an S1P mimetic, for relapsing multiple sclerosis. We quantified S1P levels in six brain regions that are differentially affected by AD pathology, in a cohort of 34 post-mortem brains, divided into four groups based on Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging. S1P declined with increasing Braak stage, and this was most pronounced in brain regions most heavily affected by AD pathology. The S1P/sphingosine ratio was 66% and 64% lower in Braak stage III/IV hippocampus (pâ€‰=â€‰0.010) and inferior temporal cortex (pâ€‰=â€‰0.014), respectively, compared to controls. In accordance with this change, both SphK1 and SphK2 activity declined with increasing Braak pathology in the hippocampus (pâ€‰=â€‰0.032 and 0.047, respectively). S1P/sphingosine ratio was 2.5-fold higher in hippocampus of ApoE2 carriers compared to ApoE4 carriers, and multivariate regression showed a significant association between APOE genotype and hippocampal S1P/sphingosine (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0495), suggesting a new link between APOE genotype and pre-disposition to AD. This study demonstrates loss of S1P and sphingosine kinase activity early in AD pathogenesis, and prior to AD diagnosis. Our findings establish a rationale for further exploring S1P receptor pharmacology in the context of AD therapy. 
24330534	The role of diffusion tensor imaging in detecting microstructural changes in prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
CNS Neurosci Ther 20131212 2014Jan
The MRI technique diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is reviewed along with microstructural changes associated with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. The prodromal stage of AD is characterized by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), representing a transitional state between normal aging and AD. Microstructural abnormalities on DTI are promising in vivo biomarkers of gray and white matter changes associated with the progression of AD pathology. Elevated mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy are consistently found in prodromal AD, and even in cognitively normal elderly who progress to MCI. However, quality of parameter maps may be affected by artifacts of motion, susceptibility, and eddy current-induced distortions. The DTI maps are typically analyzed by region-of-interest or voxel-based analytic techniques such as tract-based spatial statistics. DTI-based index of diffusivity is complementary to macrostructural gray matter changes in the hippocampus in detecting prodromal AD. Breakdown of structural connectivity measured with DTI may impact cognitive performance during early AD. Furthermore, assessment of hippocampal connections may help in understanding the cerebral organization and remodeling associated with treatment response.  
24460990	Silymarin effect on amyloid-Î² plaque accumulation and gene expression of APP in an Alzheimer's disease rat model.
Daru 20140124 2014
The deposition of amyloid peptides is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These amyloid peptides are derived from the amyloid protein precursor (APP). Silymarin, a standardized extract of milk thistle, which is currently used in liver diseases, may be effective in the inhibition of amyloid formation. However, its effect has not been assessed on APP expression. In this study, first, the effect of silymarin was examined on the passive avoidance learning in a rat model of AD. This model was induced by the intracerebroventricular injection of AÎ² peptide (AÎ²1-42) in Wistar rats. Rats were treated with 70 and 140Â mg/kgof the extract, once a day, for 4 weeks. Memory function that was evaluated in a shuttle-cage test, showed improvement upon administration of this extract. Brain amyloid plaques had also decreased upon administration of the extract. Furthermore, APP gene expression was compared in treated and untreated groups. The result showed that silymarin was able to suppress APP expression. Our results are in accordance with the in vitro tests concerning the positive antiamyloidogenic property of the main component of silymarin, namely silibinin. We suggest that the beneficial effect of sylimarin in the AD model is related to its capacity to disaggregate amyloid plaques and to suppress APP expression. Considering the limited side effects of silymarin, this compound could be of use in AD therapy. 
23589138	Regional covariance patterns of gray matter alterations in Alzheimer's disease and its replicability evaluation.
J Magn Reson Imaging 20130415 2014Jan
To identify regional network covariance patterns of gray matter associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to further evaluate its replicability and stability. This study applied a multivariate analytic approach based on scaled subprofile modeling (SSM) to structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 19 patients with AD and 19 healthy controls (HC). We further applied the derived covariance patterns to examine the replicability and stability of AD-associated covariance patterns in an independent dataset (13 AD and 14 HC) acquired with a different scanner. The AD-associated covariance patterns identified from SSM combined principal components mainly involved the temporal lobe and parietal lobe. The expression of covariance patterns was significantly higher in AD patients than HC (t(36) â€‰=â€‰5.84, Pâ€‰=â€‰5.75E-7) and predicted the AD/HC group membership (84% sensitivity and 90% specificity). In replicability evaluation, the expression of the forward applied covariance patterns was still statistically significant and had acceptable discriminability (69% sensitivity and 71% specificity). AD patients showed regional gray matter alterations in a reliable covariance manner. The results suggest that SSM has utility for characterizing covariant features, and therefore can assist with further understanding covariance patterns of gray matter in AD based on the view of the network. 
24435893	Early psychosocial intervention in Alzheimer's disease: cost utility evaluation alongside the Danish Alzheimer's Intervention Study (DAISY).
BMJ Open 20140115 2014
To assess the cost utility of early psychosocial intervention for patients with Alzheimer's disease and their primary caregivers. Cost utility evaluation alongside a multicentre, randomised controlled trial with 3 years of follow-up. Primary care and memory clinics in five Danish districts. 330 community-dwelling patients and their primary caregivers. Psychosocial counselling and support lasting 8-12 months after diagnosis and follow-up at 3, 6, 12 and 36 months in the intervention group or follow-up only in the control group. The primary outcome measure was the cost of additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were measured from a societal perspective, including the costs of healthcare, social care, informal care and production loss. QALYs were estimated separately for the patient and the caregiver before aggregation for the main analysis. None of the observed cost and QALY measures were significantly different between the intervention and control groups, although a tendency was noted for psychosocial care leading to cost increases with informal care that was not outweighed by the tendency for cost savings with formal care. The probability of psychosocial intervention being cost-effective did not exceed 36% for any threshold value. The alternative scenario analysis showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness increased over the range of threshold values used if the cost perspective was restricted to formal healthcare. A multifaceted, psychosocial intervention programme was found unlikely to be cost-effective from a societal perspective. The recommendation for practice in settings that are similar to the Danish setting is to provide follow-up with referral to available local support programmes when needed, and to restrict large multifaceted intervention programmes to patients and caregivers with special needs until further evidence for cost-effectiveness emerges. The study was registered in the Clinical Trial Database as ISRCTN74848736. 
24054991	Insulin-like growth factor-1 and risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease: findings from a family study.
Neurobiol. Aging 20130920 2014Mar
Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), part of an evolutionary conserved signaling pathway in both mammalian and non-mammalian species, is inferred in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A murine model for AD shows that reduced IGF-1 signaling prevents AD-like characteristics. However, variation in serum levels of IGF-1 and risk of AD in humans has yet to be determined. We used a proven family design, comparing middle-aged offspring with and without a parental history of AD. The offspring under study carry an increased risk of AD but do not yet experience cognitive impairment. A total of 206 offspring from 92 families with a parental history of AD were compared with 200 offspring from 97 families without a parental history of AD. Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotypes and serum IGF-1 levels were compared in subjects with and without a parental history of AD using linear regression, adjusted for APOE genotype and other possible demographic and clinical confounders. Offspring with a parental history of AD were more likely to be an APOE Îµ4 allele carrier (46.5% vs. 21%, p = 0.001) than were offspring without such a parental history. Offspring with a parental history of AD had higher IGF-1 levels than subjects without such a history, in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses (18.3 mmol/L vs. 16.7 mmol/L, p = 0.001). In conclusion, higher serum IGF-1 levels in middle age are associated with risk of AD disease in older age, independent of APOE genotype. 
24094579	Melanocortins protect against progression of Alzheimer's disease in triple-transgenic mice by targeting multiple pathophysiological pathways.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131001 2014Mar
Besides specific triggering causes, Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves pathophysiological pathways that are common to acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Melanocortins induce neuroprotection in experimental acute neurodegenerative conditions, and low melanocortin levels have been found in occasional studies performed in AD-type dementia patients. Here we investigated the possible neuroprotective role of melanocortins in a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, AD, by using 12-week-old (at the start of the study) triple-transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice harboring human transgenes APPSwe, PS1M146V, and tauP301L. Treatment of 3xTg-AD mice, once daily until the end of the study (30 weeks of age), with the melanocortin analog [Nle(4),D-Phe(7)]-Î±-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-Î±-MSH) reduced cerebral cortex/hippocampus phosphorylation/level of all AD-related biomarkers investigated (mediators of amyloid/tau cascade, oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, apoptosis), decreased neuronal loss, induced over-expression of the synaptic activity-dependent gene Zif268, and improved cognitive functions, relative to saline-treated 3xTg-AD mice. Pharmacological blockade of melanocortin MC4 receptors prevented all neuroprotective effects of NDP-Î±-MSH. Our study identifies, for the first time, a class of drugs, MC4 receptor-stimulating melanocortins, that are able to counteract the progression of experimental AD by targeting pathophysiological mechanisms up- and down-stream of Î²-amyloid and tau. These data could have important clinical implications. 
24112789	Nature of the neurotoxic membrane actions of amyloid-Î² on hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131008 2014Mar
The mechanism by which amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) produces brain dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease is largely unknown. According to previous studies, AÎ² might share perforating properties with gramicidin, a well-accepted membrane-disrupting peptide. Therefore, we hypothesize that the key steps leading to synaptotoxicity by AÎ² and gramicidin involve peptide aggregation, pore formation, and calcium dysregulation. Here, we show that AÎ² and gramicidin form aggregates enriched in Î²-sheet structures using electron microscopy, and Thioflavin and Congo Red staining techniques. Also, we found that AÎ² and gramicidin display fairly similar actions in hippocampal cell membranes, i.e. inducing Ca(2+) entry and synaptoxicity characterized by the loss of synaptic proteins and a decrease in neuronal viability. These effects were not observed in a Ca(2+) free solution, indicating that both AÎ² and gramicidin induce neurotoxicity by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Using combined perforated patch clamp and imaging recordings, we found that only AÎ² produced a perforation that progressed from a small (Cl(-)-selective pore) to a larger perforation that allowed the entry of fluorescent molecules. Therefore, based on these results, we propose that the perforation at the plasma membrane by AÎ² is a dynamic process that is critical in producing neurotoxicity similar to that found in the brains of AD patients.  
24119542	Investigating the role of rare heterozygous TREM2 variants in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131009 2014Mar
Homozygous mutations in exon 2 of TREM2, a gene involved in Nasu-Hakola disease, can cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Moreover, a rare TREM2 exon 2 variant (p.R47H) was reported to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an odds ratio as strong as that for APOEÎµ4. We systematically screened the TREM2 coding region within a Belgian study on neurodegenerative brain diseases (1216 AD patients, 357 FTD patients, and 1094 controls). We observed an enrichment of rare variants across TREM2 in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, most notably in the extracellular IgV-set domain (relative risk = 3.84 [95% confidence interval = 1.29-11.44]; p = 0.009 for AD; relative risk = 6.19 [95% confidence interval = 1.86-20.61]; p = 0.0007 for FTD). None of the rare variants individually reached significant association, but the frequency of p.R47H was increased ~ 3-fold in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, in line with previous reports. Meta-analysis including 11 previously screened AD cohorts confirmed the association of p.R47H with AD (p = 2.93Ã—10(-17)). Our data corroborate and extend previous findings to include an increased frequency of rare heterozygous TREM2 variations in AD and FTD, and show that TREM2 variants may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases in general. 
24119546	Choosing Alzheimer's disease prevention clinical trial populations.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131009 2014Mar
To assist investigators in making design choices, we modeled Alzheimer's disease prevention clinical trials. We used longitudinal Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes data, retention rates, and the proportions of trial-eligible cognitively normal participants age 65 and older in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to model trial sample sizes, the numbers needed to enroll to account for drop out, and the numbers needed to screen to successfully complete enrollment. We examined how enrichment strategies affected each component of the model. Relative to trials enrolling 65-year-old individuals, trials enriching for older (minimum 70 or 75) age required reduced sample sizes, numbers needed to enroll, and numbers needed to screen. Enriching for subjective memory complaints reduced sample sizes and numbers needed to enroll more than age enrichment, but increased the number needed to screen. We conclude that Alzheimer's disease prevention trials can enroll elderly participants with minimal effect on trial retention and that enriching for older individuals with memory complaints might afford efficient trial designs.  
24126163	Tissue plasminogen activator arrests Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131012 2014Mar
The progressive deposition of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) in the brain is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was aimed to determine whether endogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) modulates the pathogenic process of AD. tPA expression and activity developed around amyloid plaques in the brains of human amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing Tg2576 mice, which were weakened by the genetic ablation of tPA. Although the complete loss of tPA was developmentally fatal to Tg2576 mice, tPA-heterozygous Tg2576 mice expressed the more severe degenerative phenotypes than tPA wild-type Tg2576 mice, including abnormal and unhealthy growth, shorter life spans, significantly enhanced AÎ² levels, and the deposition of more and larger amyloid plaques in the brain. In addition, the expression of synaptic function-associated proteins was significantly reduced, which in turn caused a more severe impairment in learning and memory performance in Tg2576 mice. Thus, endogenous tPA, preferentially its aggregate form, could degrade AÎ² molecules and maintain low levels of brain AÎ², resulting in the delay of AD pathogenesis.  
24210253	Multinutrient diets improve cerebral perfusion and neuroprotection in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131002 2014Mar
Nutritional intervention may retard the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we tested the effects of 2 multi-nutrient diets in an AD mouse model (APPswe/PS1dE9). One diet contained membrane precursors such as omega-3 fatty acids and uridine monophosphate (DEU), whereas another diet contained cofactors for membrane synthesis as well (Fortasyn); the diets were developed to enhance synaptic membranes synthesis, and contain components that may improve vascular health. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) and water diffusivity with ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging, as alterations in these parameters correlate with clinical symptoms of the disease. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice on control diet showed decreased CBF and changes in brain water diffusion, in accordance with findings of hypoperfusion, axonal disconnection and neuronal loss in patients with AD. Both multinutrient diets were able to increase cortical CBF in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and Fortasyn reduced water diffusivity, particularly in the dentate gyrus and in cortical regions. We suggest that a specific diet intervention has the potential to slow AD progression, by simultaneously improving cerebrovascular health and enhancing neuroprotective mechanisms.  
24269023	Glial fibrillary acidic protein isoform expression in plaque related astrogliosis in Alzheimer's disease.
Neurobiol. Aging 20131023 2014Mar
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid plaques are surrounded by reactive astrocytes with an increased expression of intermediate filaments including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Different GFAP isoforms have been identified that are differentially expressed by specific subpopulations of astrocytes and that impose different properties to the intermediate filament network. We studied transcript levels and protein expression patterns of all known GFAP isoforms in human hippocampal AD tissue at different stages of the disease. Ten different transcripts for GFAP isoforms were detected at different abundancies. Transcript levels of most isoforms increased with AD progression. GFAPÎ´-immunopositive astrocytes were observed in subgranular zone, hilus, and stratum-lacunosum-moleculare. GFAPÎ´-positive cells also stained for GFAPÎ±. In AD donors, astrocytes near plaques displayed increased staining of both GFAPÎ± and GFAPÎ´. The reading-frame-shifted isoform, GFAP(+1), staining was confined to a subset of astrocytes with long processes, and their number increased in the course of AD. In conclusion, the various GFAP isoforms show differential transcript levels and are upregulated in a concerted manner in AD. The GFAP(+1) isoform defines a unique subset of astrocytes, with numbers increasing with AD progression. These data indicate the need for future exploration of underlying mechanisms concerning the functions of GFAPÎ´ and GFAP(+1) isoforms in astrocytes and their possible role in AD pathology. 
24433274	Plasma protein profiling of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease using iTRAQ quantitative proteomics.
Proteome Sci 20140117 2014
With the promise of disease modifying treatments, there is a need for more specific diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma biomarkers are likely to be utilised to increase diagnostic accuracy and specificity of AD and cognitive decline. Isobaric tags (iTRAQ) and proteomic methods were used to identify potential plasma biomarkers of MCI and AD. Relative protein expression level changes were quantified in plasma of 411 cognitively normal subjects, 19Â AD patients and 261 MCI patients. Plasma was pooled into 4 groups including normal control, AD, amnestic single and multiple domain MCI (aMCI), and nonamnestic single and multiple domain MCI (nMCI). Western-blotting was used to validate iTRAQ data. Integrated function and protein interactions were explored using WEB based bioinformatics tools (DAVID v6.7 and STRING v9.0). In at least two iTRAQ replicate experiments, 30 proteins were significantly dysregulated in MCI and AD plasma, relative to controls. These proteins included ApoA1, ApoB100, complement C3, C4b-binding protein, afamin, vitamin D-binding protein precursor, isoform 1 of Gelsolin actin regulator, Ig mÎ¼ chain C region (IGHM), histidine-rich glycoprotein and fibrinogen Î² and Î³ chains. Western-blotting confirmed that afamin was decreased and IGHM was increased in MCI and AD groups. Bioinformatics results indicated that these dysregulated proteins represented a diversity of biological processes, including acute inflammatory response, cholesterol transport and blood coagulation. These findings demonstrate that expression level changes in multiple proteins are observed in MCI and AD plasma. Some of these, such as afamin and IGHM, may be candidate biomarkers for AD and the predementia condition of MCI. 
23880336	Cortical changes associated with depression and antidepressant use in Alzheimer and Lewy body dementia: an MRI surface-based morphometric study.
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 20130720 2014Jan
Depression is common in dementia, especially in the early stages, with important clinical implications, but the etiology is unknown and most likely heterogeneous. Antidepressant use in the elderly without dementia has previously been shown to be associated with high risks of adverse events and with structural brain alterations. To investigate cortical changes associated with depression and antidepressant use in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). 74 subjects with mild AD and LBD from geriatric and psychiatry outpatient clinics in Western Norway were included. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess depression. Automatic preprocessing using Freesurfer included steps for white and grey matter surface reconstruction. The resulting cortical thickness was analyzed using linear modeling. Clusters of depression-associated thinning were found in prefrontal and temporal areas. Treatment-associated thinning was observed in the parahippocampal region and was significant even after correction for age, sex, AD/LBD diagnosis, and MADRS scores. Depression in mild AD and LBD is associated with cortical thinning in prefrontal and temporal areas. The findings suggest that depressive symptoms in mild dementia could develop due to neurodegeneration in the same neural circuits that are critical for depression across different brain disorders. Antidepressant use in patients with mild AD and LBD is associated with parahippocampal thinning. Taken together with low efficacy of antidepressants in cognitively impaired patients and high risks of adverse events, our results suggest a need to re-evaluate the treatment approaches for depression and the role of antidepressants in patients with dementia. 
23799530	Biomarkers in amyloid-Î² immunotherapy trials in Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychopharmacology 20130625 2014Jan
Drug candidates directed against amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) are mainstream in Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development. Active and passive AÎ² immunotherapy is the principle that has come furthest, both in number and in stage of clinical trials. However, an increasing number of reports on major difficulties in identifying any clinical benefit in phase II-III clinical trials on this type of anti-AÎ² drug candidates have caused concern among researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and other stakeholders. This has provided critics of the amyloid cascade hypothesis with fire for their arguments that AÎ² deposition may merely be a bystander, and not the cause, of the disease or that the amyloid hypothesis may only be valid for the familial form of AD. On the other hand, most researchers argue that it is the trial design that will need refinement to allow for identifying a positive clinical effect of anti-AÎ² drugs. A consensus in the field is that future trials need to be performed in an earlier stage of the disease and that biomarkers are essential to guide and facilitate drug development. In this context, it is reassuring that, in contrast to most brain disorders, research advances in the AD field have led to both imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for the central pathogenic processes of the disease. AD biomarkers will have a central role in future clinical trials to enable early diagnosis, and AÎ² biomarkers (CSF AÎ²42 and amyloid PET) may be essential to allow for testing a drug on patients with evidence of brain AÎ² pathology. Pharmacodynamic AÎ² and amyloid precursor protein biomarkers will be of use to verify target engagement of a drug candidate in humans, thereby bridging the gap between mechanistic data from transgenic AD models (that may not be relevant to the neuropathology of human AD) and large and expensive phase III trials. Last, downstream biomarker evidence (CSF tau proteins and MRI volumetry) that the drug ameliorates neurodegeneration will, together with beneficial clinical effects on cognition and functioning, be essential for labeling an anti-AÎ² drug as disease modifying.  
24045077	Inter-modality relationship constrained multi-modality multi-task feature selection for Alzheimer's Disease and mild cognitive impairment identification.
Neuroimage 20130914 2014Jan1
Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of integrated information from multi-modalities could significantly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, feature selection, which is one of the most important steps in classification, is typically performed separately for each modality, which ignores the potentially strong inter-modality relationship within each subject. Recent emergence of multi-task learning approach makes the joint feature selection from different modalities possible. However, joint feature selection may unfortunately overlook different yet complementary information conveyed by different modalities. We propose a novel multi-task feature selection method to preserve the complementary inter-modality information. Specifically, we treat feature selection from each modality as a separate task and further impose a constraint for preserving the inter-modality relationship, besides separately enforcing the sparseness of the selected features from each modality. After feature selection, a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) is further used to integrate the selected features from each modality for classification. Our method is evaluated using the baseline PET and MRI images of subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our method achieves a good performance, with an accuracy of 94.37% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9724 for AD identification, and also an accuracy of 78.80% and an AUC of 0.8284 for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identification. Moreover, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 67.83% and an AUC of 0.6957 for separating between MCI converters and MCI non-converters (to AD). These performances demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art classification methods.  
23978694	The effects of a concurrent motor task on walking in Alzheimer's disease.
Gait Posture 20130806 2014Jan
The important relationship between cognition and gait in people with dementia has been explored with dual-task studies using added cognitive tasks. Effects of less commonly studied but also attention-dividing motor dual-tasks are important to assess in this group as they are common in everyday function and may affect gait differently from cognitive dual-tasks. They may also be easier to comprehend allowing their application with more severe cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects and feasibility of a motor dual-task (MDT) on gait measures in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thirty people (15 men, mean age Â± SD, 80.2 Â± 5.8 years) with a diagnosis of probable AD (MMSE range 8-28) walked on an electronic walkway (i) at self-selected comfortable pace and (ii) at self-selected comfortable pace while carrying a tray and glasses. The MDT produced significant decreases in velocity (Baseline=111.5 Â± 26.5 cm/s, MDT=96.8 Â± 25.7 cm/s, p&lt;0.001) and stride length (Baseline=121.4 Â± 21.6 cm, MDT=108.1 Â± 21.0 cm, p&lt;0.001) with medium effect sizes, and increased stride time (Baseline=1.11 Â± 0.11s, MDT=1.14 Â± 0.12s, p=0.001) with small effect size. Measures of spatial (Baseline=3.2 Â± 1.0%, MDT=3.9 Â± 1.5%, p=0.006) and temporal (Baseline=2.4 Â± 0.8%, MDT=2.8 Â± 0.8%, p=0.008) variability increased with the motor dual-task, with medium effect sizes. A trend for motor dual-task changes in gait measures to increase with greater disease severity did not reach significance. The tray-carrying task was feasible, even for participants with severe cognitive decline. Further comparison of different types of motor and cognitive dual-tasks may contribute to development of a framework for clinical intervention to improve reduced dual-task walking capacity in people with AD. 
24103729	Novel 5-aryloxypyrimidine SEN1576 as a candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Int. J. Neuropsychopharmacol. 20131008 2014Jan
Prefibrillar assembly of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) is a major event underlying the development of neuropathology and dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study determined the neuroprotective properties of an orally bioavailable AÎ² synaptotoxicity inhibitor, SEN1576. Binding of SEN1576 to monomeric AÎ² 1-42 was measured using surface plasmon resonance. Thioflavin-T and MTT assays determined the ability of SEN1576 to block AÎ² 1-42-induced aggregation and reduction in cell viability, respectively. In vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) determined effects on synaptic toxicity induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of cell-derived AÎ² oligomers. An operant behavioural schedule measured effects of oral administration following i.c.v. injection of AÎ² oligomers in normal rats. SEN1576 bound to monomeric AÎ² 1-42, protected neuronal cells exposed to AÎ² 1-42, reduced deficits in in vivo LTP and behaviour. SEN1576 exhibits the necessary features of a drug candidate for further development as a disease modifying treatment for the early stages of AD-like dementia.
